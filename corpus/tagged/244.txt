dung	 dont try and find dates at 826 that gets thats bad  laughter  taliesin wow you took that to a dark place you took that  matt anyway so so let us go ahead and delve into tonights game proper folks so to get you  up to speed vox machina the intrepid band of adventurers you see before you after a series of  adventures had found their way back to their central city of emon in the center of the region  of taldorei after a ceremony in which the leader of their city sovereign uriel taldorei 
town	 was  announcing him stepping down the town was suddenly under siege by a group of extremely  powerful and dangerous ancient dragons that call themselves the chroma conclave after tearing the  city asunder in many places three of them flew off into the east under the instruction of the  fourth and possibly largest and leader of the group that has recently been found to be called  thordak the cinder king who currently resides in the center of the city of emon claiming that his  mercy is only for those who worship him and essentially feed 
none	 his greed and hunger as such  vox machina narrowly escaping the battle a couple of encounters with these dragons including  one above their keep are housing a number of survivors who have made their way out of the city  and are currently residing in greyskull keep for protection you guys went into the city to see if  you could find any other allies and friends that may have survived this encounter you befriended a  member of the clasp named garthok who walked amongst the rubble and proceeded to show you the  secret entrance he 
none	 knows to the clasp of which you may be trying to inquire about information on  your way to that area you passed by gilmores shop gilmore being a good friend of the group and  a powerful magic practitioner and creator of magical items and artifacts and a number of  glorious goods his abode however smashed and currently a pile of burnt wood and rock looters  were currently poring through and you attempted to get them to leave the area alone it came to  blows and with many of the looters falling in battle two of 
none	 which were kept locked away you discovered  the location of where they were hoarding the massive amounts of gold and artifacts that they  had acquired from the rubble you then found the secret compartment in which gilmores  teleportation sigil was locked beneath his shop where the remaining family of taldorei salda and  the three children as well as gilmore himself wounded and barely alive having saved them you  found that uriel the sovereign did not seemingly survive the encounter with the dragons and  gilmore nearly fell going back to try and make sure that 
none	 you guys were okay barely escaping with  his life you managed to save his and taking the children salda sherri and gilmore back to  greyskull keep some of you splintered off to try and acquire the goods that were taken from his  store however they apparently had already been stolen from the location they were being stored  in or been delivered already youre uncertain as to what became of them but you get the sense that  it was probably best that you chose gilmore over the gold at first glance making your way back to 
none	 the  keep youve sent gilmore up to rest for the evening some of you have then found your way down  into the temple of sarenrae where a number of the escaped refugees from emon currently try  desperately to cling to their memories to try and keep the shakes at bay and contemplate what the  next step is for survival in this now partially ruined city that was where we left off so what  would you like to do  sam kill all the dragons and save the day  matt good roll for it  
none	 laura oh that was a good roll see  taliesin natural 20 no no  marisha good show guys  laura i rolled five natural 20s before the show even started  sam thats a great great idea  laura so its all going to be terrible  sam why are you rolling before the show  travis she feels like shes got to warm up her endless army of dice  laura no i just have to figure out which ones i want to use that night  travis you have five d20s right now  laura i know 
none	 and theyre all useful no ive got six out here  liam yeah yeah definitely all useful  taliesin this is by the way for anybody tuning in for the first time at home this is how we  express that we have no idea what to do  sam where are we  taliesin were at home  matt youre in greyskull keep  sam and gilmores with us  matt gilmores with you hes been brought upstairs  liam and did pikes holy visitor fix the keep or is the keep still effed up  matt actually in 
none	 the short time in which her visitor this angelic devalike entity that was  brought forth from sarenraes sphere of influence did manage to repair entirely the damage that was  sustained to the keep from the battle with vorugal out in your courtyard so yes greyskull keep is  now back to being intact and rather fairly polished the stained glass is affixed and  corrected  liam it must look so strange next to the ruined city of emon  matt its far enough away but  laura little strange  marisha so what time is it it 
none	 was nighttime right or was it midday  matt its about midafternoon at this point maybe pushing into the evening  taliesin is kima still around  matt im sorry what was that  taliesin is lady kima still around or  matt lady kimas been in vasselheim  taliesin oh not vasselheim im sorry allura im on the wrong page  matt yeah she and drake went  marisha remember they turned into shooting stars and they flew away  sam is clarota still here with us  laughter  laura were off to a good start tonight guys 
none	  matt in your hearts in your heart of hearts  travis no not even there that piece of shit where are the majority of the people are they in  the dining hall and in the  matt theyre scattered between the dining hall and the temple to sarenrae partially because  one theres enough space there two its a place of sanctity its a place of hope and pike is  currently bringing people not preaching to them per se but offering comfort in their current area  of misery and worry so those are pretty much the 
none	 localized areas occasionally one of the kids  might begin wandering the halls a parent might chase after them trying to draw them back in but  respectfully no ones wandering the house filling their pockets theyre all still happy to be alive  at this point  laura well thats because we dont have anything because scanlans troupe stole  everything anyway  matt theres that too  sam we bought new silverware  travis sure we did  sam maybe it wasnt my troupe maybe it was our new guests the people fleeing for their lives  travis 
none	 i was going to say are there any new people that have come into the keep while weve  been away can i ask one of our guards that  matt sure yeah shayne whos out front currently strolling through the courtyard comes  up to you and as you ask her she goes well weve had a few other refugees come in and ask for  entry and we patted them down to make sure there were no weapons and tried our best to keep an eye  on them since they arrived seems like most everyones keeping either 
none	 into the city or keeping  fairly underground  travis nobodys sticking out to you though no shady individuals nobody sweating more than is  necessary when being threatened by a big fuckoff dragon  matt not yet but i believe jaretts keeping a close eye  travis jarett  sam that guy mancrush  travis no  laughter  sam i wonder in all prudence should we go around to the fugees the refugees and do a  quick  laura insight check  sam  scan alignment check or something  travis lauryn hill is shaking her head 
none	  laura do we have anything that can sense peoples alignment  sam pike might  marisha yeah i can  sam can you do a mass a mass sense alignment  marisha mass sense alignment  sam is that a thing  marisha no im saying i could do some insight checks on people  sam oh im talking about your magic  marisha no im not pike  sam all right  travis pikes with us though right she could do an insight check  sam is she with us  matt pike is with you she is 
none	 currently helping folks inside the temple but you could go ask her  to  liam use the skull to wish to know everyones alignment problem solved  travis well kill everyone kill everyone  sam maybe we should just kill one of them to make an example  laura this is terrible what is happening  liam this isnt the real game the game hasnt actually started yet  matt so glancing about the populace of scattered refugees throughout the general vicinity of  greyskull keep i will pick two of you who wish to be the main surveyors 
none	 of the crew  sam is this insight  matt this would be insight yes  laura im on it  marisha im on it with vex  matt okay so vex and keyleth both you guys roll insight checks please  laura see this is why i shouldnt have this many dice because i dont know what to choose okay  21  liam insight  marisha 22  laura 21  matt okay both of you guys spend about ten 15 minutes or so scanning through the crew asking a  few questions helping a few folks out 
none	 while keeping an eye on reactions around the general  vicinity no one sticks out to you as being either hiding their intent shifty there are a few folks  that are aloof from the whole experience who seem to be either in a state of shock or discomfort  based on their current surroundings but nothing in a way that strikes you as nefarious or  worrisome  liam and are they all strangers other than the people we brought back with us  matt correct  liam they are strangers  matt yeah theres a lot of people 
town	 that live in emon and none of them seem to catch your eye  liam yeah is anyone still badly hurt  matt most of them have had their wounds tended to there are a few that have general scars some  from elements of frostbite on their skin who were caught in the blast who were salvaged after  vorugal left there are a few that have scrapes and bruises from fleeing from the town from  collapsing debris from different buildings and such but no serious injuries a few bone  fractures here and there that have been 
none	 set and bandaged  liam im going to spend the first bit of time at home helping pike doing whatever she tells me to  do really to help the people here  marisha is there any deceased that need to be tended to  matt well there are a number of deceased in the front courtyard people that were frozen and  shattered as part of vorugals attack which at this point most of them have been taken care of  by the guards and given a proper burial on the outside of the keep a few yards away 
dung	 towards the  inside of the one of the hills they havent been left to thaw if that was what youre worried  about  marisha thats what i was worried about  taliesin red meat red  laura gross  liam way to go dark way to go dark  taliesin i thought thats what we were doing today  matt costeffective a number of the refugees have also helped the guards as well transporting  the bodies of the deceased and making sure that theyre properly interred in the nearby  countryside  marisha okay  sam what 
none	 are our options here first of all do we know gilmores status  laura yeah we need to get him settled in make sure hes all right  liam well hes gone up hes resting  marisha yeah we put him to bed already  liam hes in percivals room i think you said you would sleep in your laboratory  sam and when we last left things there was one plan to go into the tunnels of the thieves guild  and try to see if theres any more  laura yes actually garthok  marisha yes  laura 
none	 garthok is waiting for us down in those so we can go look at the clasp and talk to them and  everything because hes told them were on our way  sam and to what end again were going to see if theres any random diplomats left over  taliesin theyre the only functioning organization left in the city at this point  liam its true theyre a doubleedged sword though i mean they should not be trusted we  cannot trust them but they are an infrastructure under the city they may have more of an idea  
none	 whats going on than we do im the best to speak to them but im not on good terms with them and  ive never really talked to you about this but you were marked at one point a long time ago  laura what  sam for death  liam actually yes  laura why what did i do  liam im sure i dont know the reason there is a brand on my back is because i interceded some  other schmoe died instead of you you might be a bit of a sore point with them i 
none	 dont know they  might not remember but i dont think thats true i think theyll remember  marisha how long ago was this  sam what did you do  laura so many things  liam before we met when vex and i were on our own  sam was it because you farted that time  laura you didnt think you could mention this all the times weve dealt with the clasp you  didnt think it was worth mentioning that i almost died  marisha shes already been down there shes already been down there you think 
none	 theyre going  to recognize her now  liam were going down to talk  laura weve been down there to talk  liam right all right  laura thats why you dont keep secrets  taliesin well i say that we organize a group lets not get overexcited about the sudden  realization that some of us can be a bit iffy weve all had a moment probably within the last  three weeks im not saying i dont  travis i havent  taliesin yes oddly you and pike seem to be immune  travis it is a 
none	 virtue  taliesin but lets organize a group and lets at least open relations with them at this point  marisha well hang on hang on what are we going to say to them when we get down there what are we  going to offer them  taliesin we are going to offer them our services in getting this city back to a functioning level  they dont want a city ruled by a dragon we dont want a city ruled by a dragon its in their  interest to help us clear the city  liam theyre going 
none	 to look out for themselves and youre probably im sure youre right they  want these dragons out but they will do they will preserve their own existence and theres a  possibility that bowing before these beasts will preserve their existence  taliesin not longterm and these are groups that think longterm  marisha wait are you talking about us bowing to the clasp or the clasp bowing to the okay  sorry there were levels  liam and yes weve been down there weve argued with them but were talking about going down  there and making an 
none	 alliance an ongoing alliance and shit might come up thats all im saying  taliesin lets make it a business deal were talking about making a political decision this is  politics  travis what if they leave what if they leave the city or what if they turn us in to the dragon to  save their own asses  taliesin they could i doubt theyd leave thats a terrible waste of an investment  marisha youre essentially relying on the underbelly of emon to restore it  taliesin i am im relying on greed it tends to be 
none	 exceedingly reliable  marisha in your experience  taliesin yes  laura in all experience lets be honest  taliesin thank you  travis said the greedy one to the greedy one  liam this is one option are we sure we dont want to seek help  sam yes what are our other options  taliesin im curious as to other options  sam we know why the dragons are here right ish  marisha i really feel like it might be necessary for me to also reach out to the air and earth and  possibly even the 
none	 water ashari it might be difficult because i havent been there yet to see  if theyve had any other tears through the other elemental planes  taliesin that would be quite wise  marisha we can also seek to employ their services  travis scanlan  sam huh  travis what about you becoming a spy  sam ive been thinking about that long and hard  marisha have you  sam yes  marisha what are your thoughts  sam most of what i do is long and hard and my thoughts are still fuck you no way 
none	 fuck off  travis so what youre saying is  sam maybe  laughter  liam so youre saying theres a chance  travis your shining moment  taliesin nothing is ever going to top the triceratops really  sam maybe the triceratops could kill all the dragons  travis all right so we reach out to the ashari  taliesin absolutely  sam hows your homeland  taliesin i dont know  sam do we need to find out  taliesin i would love to  sam you can transport there instantly  taliesin i can i just cant 
none	 get back instantly  laura you need keyleth  taliesin and i figure that they would have sent somebody at this point if things had gone they  have an instant transport to us if they need to find us  sam true  laura unless they dont know about the stone and the only one with the stone  taliesin the council knows about the stone  travis or theres no one left to send  liam yes if things went south  taliesin we wouldve heard  marisha i can scry twice today  taliesin that would be 
none	 lovely  marisha i can do it two times so we need to pick where its most important to check in versus where  we might want to pop in and say hello  taliesin whitestone is also somewhere we could arm ourselves more completely against something  like this were going to have to start  travis with what  matt as a note too pike can also scry as well  laura oh good because i would like to check in to vasselheim as well  sam how do you kill a dragon do we need a dragon 
none	 can we get a dragon that hates these  dragons is that a thing  laura you know there is the slayers take  travis wait what are we talking about dragons do other dragons hate dragons  sam yeah could we find a dragon who could fight for us  laura well theres metallic dragons  liam dont get along with chromatic  sam do we know any metallic dragons  travis yeah where are they  marisha we would have to go to vasselheim and maybe  taliesin my aunt edna  travis what  taliesin shes a 
none	 dragonlady i dont know if thats the same thing  marisha like oh like she little ceramic dragons she likes collecting them  taliesin i was mocking him yes  sam so wait the slayers take what  laura well its an organization made to hunt massive creatures isnt it  liam its a horde of fucking asskickers is what it is  taliesin we fought a dragon we killed a dragon for them  marisha theyre also rooted in vasselheim which is  sam its safe  laura yes but if everything else is under attack vasselheim is inevitable 
none	  sam yes but theyre protected  laura for a time  liam allow me to play tieflings advocate if we leave now and allow the clasp to take hold and  form some sort of new shadow government without us having any part in it its out of our control  completely it wont be in our control at all but maybe if we speak to them now well have a better  idea of whats going on im not sold on any idea yet but if we leave now and let things play out  its entirely out 
none	 of our hands  marisha all right well how about this we can scry between pike and i four times so we can  make four phone calls today  sam not phone calls just a look  marisha yes look home no we can peek through a window and we can try and go visit the clasp  sam okay well lets scry it up then who are we calling whitestone vasselheim center of  emon  taliesin whitestone and vasselheim i think definitely  marisha and i want to check in with  travis can i object to 
none	 checking the center of emon right because thats where the cinder king is  taliesin yes  travis didnt it like ruin magic when we did it to the beholder didnt it see us and laugh and we  were like augh it hurts my brain  taliesin hes got a point youve got a point  sam youre pretty smart grog  marisha we dont need to scry into emon  travis i remember  liam were talking vasselheim yeah whitestone and you can do it another two  marisha you know what lets go talk to pike because 
none	 pike might possibly have some sort of  spiritual connection with vasselheim as well that might save us a scry  taliesin its possible that vasselheim might be our next stop after we secure everything here  marisha okay  sam oh pike oh  marisha i can also teleport us once today if we decide to go anywhere  sam thanks  marisha pike  sam pike pikey  matt comes out a little bit of dirt on her brow looks like shes been busy handling some of the  folks  sam i reach out and brush the 
none	 dirt from above her forehead  matt she smiles and pushes your hand away yes what yes  marisha pike do you have any sort of spiritual connection with vasselheim do you feel you know  how  matt i do i do why  marisha okay can you check  sam can you scry  marisha can you see if theyre okay we want to scry and check in with a few places  matt of course of course no worries she ushers you guys back into the temple  marisha okay  matt and then gets a little 
none	 nervous when she starts thinking about it and walks up to the  central platform of prayer and takes out her holy symbol her armors off right now by the way  shes in her ceremonial robes because its hard to clank around in armor amongst a bunch of  refugees sits down and focuses for a second and pulls out some salt and begins spreading it into  a small triangular shape around her and then pulls her holy symbol out and closes her eyes and  for that moment you can see a beam of sunlight come through 
none	 the roof the glass roof of the  temple which then refracts into multiple colors that slowly dissipate around her you can see  everyone else that has gathered in the room falls quiet and watches on as there is this tiny little  visual miracle and she stays there for a moment a few more moments probably about 30 40 seconds  pass before the light slowly retracts back up through the glass and she stands up and turns  around and goes vasselheim seems fine for now untouched from the dragons scourge at the very  least  
town	 marisha  laura thats good  taliesin what of whitestone  matt oh yes she gets right back down into position with an air of begrudging acceptance  focuses for a second spends a few more moments in her scrying ritual before stepping back and turns  slowly to you percy and says whitestone seems fairly overlooked by these dragons as well the  town rebuilds people seem to be going about their lives possibly none the wiser as to whats  transpired this side of taldorei  taliesin well send word at the very least  laura its all 
none	 over the water maybe the dragons havent gone that far  taliesin its far north ill make sure to send word  matt okay one of the kids starts crying and she goes oh hold on and goes over and starts  tending to one of the children who has like a knee brace on and is currently aching and she goes to  help calm him down shh shh  liam do you think you could look in on syngorn  marisha of course  laura mostly to see you know  marisha i step up to the table 
none	 and begin my scrying ritual checking on syngorn first  matt okay  travis shit  laura come on  taliesin we need like cups and string or something  sam we do or a walkietalkie hes saying syngorn is gone  laura dont say that  taliesin millions dead  laura millions its very large  travis remember to shop at gilmores ruined rubble  laughter  sam oh no he didnt even get a new franchise before it was  taliesin for all your reclaimed wood needs  travis oh well done well done that was nice  
none	 taliesin the best was watching laura go oh what a great i ooh  travis and endless supply of pavers and gravel  sam gilmores building supplies  laughter  travis all your home improvements  matt back to your regularly scheduled dd game  sam what did you see keyleth  marisha syngorn is gone and i dont mean destroyed i dont mean burnt i dont mean that  its rubble i mean its gone the city is gone theres like a huge chasm a huge empty spot in  the middle of the forest where syngorn once lied 
none	 lie  sam lay did it look like it was destroyed to nothing or transported somewhere  marisha like that like transported like the city was lifted out of its place and was  teleported elsewhere  sam could it have been i dont know how your scrying works could it have been some sort of a  magical block not real an illusion of some sort  matt i would like vax and vex to both roll a history check  laura any kind of advantage on that for growing up there or something  matt nope thats you 
none	 get to roll this because of that  liam history  taliesin should have stayed in school  liam didnt help  laura eight  liam 15  matt okay  taliesin can i take a roll just for being a nerd  liam all out of luck  matt are you proficient in history  taliesin i am proficient in history  matt sure ill let you roll  taliesin i want a nerd roll 24 book reading  matt okay being the astute researcher the indoor kid growing up yeah there arent a lot of  books that 
none	 made their way north about pure elven culture especially wooded elves that comprise  the entirety of the syngorn nation  taliesin i speak elven so thats good  laughter  matt it has rarely come into play but because of previous wars terrible devastation and the need  for the elvish culture to protect itself and to maintain its existence you do know that there  have been instances of large enchantments on places of cultural importance that would bridge  between here and the feywild and as a defense mechanism essentially would cloak andor shift  those locations 
none	  taliesin theyve gone into hiding  marisha how can you be sure  taliesin i cant but theres reason to believe so its what it points to  liam what points to what what are you talking about  taliesin historically elves have in times of great stress taken important sites important  places people and either cloaked them hidden them or moved them into the feywild until such  time as the danger has passed there is precedence for this theyve gone into hiding  laura great  liam thats one more thing our father failed to impart 
none	 to us  laura laughs cynically at least hes safe  taliesin most likely  marisha i need to check in on the air ashari im going to spend my last scrying  matt okay as your vision separates from your current place of origin you find yourself  drifting up into the clouds and speeding through the air the location itself is blurred though  recalling the origin of where you originally came from you pass by columns of black smoke to your  left you assume somewhere related to westrunns current location  marisha right  matt eventually 
town	 the clouds part and you find yourself thrust down upon the earth amongst the  center of the air ashari tribe you can see the thin leather constructs that make up a portion of  your peoples hovels and buildings you can see the nearby chasmbased windfall that pours through  constantly with a gentle whistling sound that forever is marked as the chorus that guides you  all to sleep every evening there you can see your people amongst various conversations going  amongst their various daily duties seemingly untouched unscathed and unaware of what recent  events had 
none	 transpired  marisha theyre okay  matt that is the last of your scrying capability for the day  taliesin you didnt have to know that big girls dont scry sorry i saw it on netflix  laura wow wow hit after hit after hit today taliesin  liam you know just because you can doesnt mean you should  taliesin i know i know coffee hasnt kicked in yet  marisha all right theyre okay they seem unaware which is very disheartening on a few  levels  taliesin well theyll know soon enough  marisha exactly  taliesin 
none	 we are going to need transport  sam to where  taliesin ah i dont think were going to win this fight staying here i think were going to  have to rally power i think were going to have to rally allies i dont think theres enough here  for us to win  laura can we relocate all of the refugees staying in our walls can we bring everyone through the  sun tree keyleth how long does it stay open  marisha six seconds  taliesin we can go in shifts this is not something thats going

none	 you begin to round up the  refugees which as a statement historically is already unnerving you begin to push them all  together in a group and tell them what  laura well we comfort them and tell them all right obviously emon is not a safe place to be  right now  matt no thats true thats true its terrible here  laura its dangerous and we want to keep all of you as safe as possible  matt yes and thank you for taking us everyone starts cheering  laura we have a plan  sam 
none	 we probably can only take a few it should be women and children  laura were going to take those of you who need the most attention first and were going to bring  you to whitestone which is a city that has not been affected by dragons at all it has much need  of people who can do an honest days labor and you can earn a wage and find a living there for  the time being and if at some point in time you want to come back to emon when all of this is

none	 matt 19 total okay so as you all gather around in the center of the temple keyleth you step up  to the outside of one of the two front trees to the temple one of the ones you guys usually use  to transport to and from here as you focus in and reach your hand out and touch the outside of the  trees bark with a rough tearing sound the tree bark widens into an ovalshaped doorway that is  immediately visible on the opposite side you can see before you a lightly snowdappled landscape  that 
town	 is the central market of whitestone  laura we put blankets on everybody right  matt from what you had  marisha go go now run go go percy go  matt whos pushing  taliesin im already through  matt percys through all right are you guys just letting them go at their own rate  travis shouting move your fucking asses  matt roll an intimidation check  marisha its like a football line  travis 17  matt 17 with that everyone goes startled noise and starts charging through wildly the  crowd starts pushing through  
none	 marisha im trying to hold it  liam no severed limbs no whammies  matt okay all of the rest the family people go through the young folks push through you manage  to get a total of 23 people through  cheering  matt some folks who werent even planning to go on this were so driven by the sudden shouting grog  voice echoing from behind that they charged forward black fridaystyle and managed to escape  the tail end of the spell tapering the doorway off  liam i regret nothing  sam well i hope percy 
town	 comes back soon  marisha ive got the gatestone  matt percy  taliesin im going to get everybody organized everyone please follow me were heading towards  the main castle  matt theyre all looking around  taliesin welcome to whitestone  matt a gentle snowfall is coming down the sky itself you can see is covered in light white  clouds just enough moisture to carry the little snowfall thats happening there are folks in the  center of the town that are surprised to see this arrival but recognize you and cheer a little bit  hey 
none	 percival  laughter  taliesin thank you for that smattering of applause golf claps please golf claps  matt the refugees all gather up behind you and you guys walk towards castle whitestone  taliesin we make our way to the castle  matt the guards greet you and lead you inside and within a few minutes cassandra comes down  from the upper floor percival youve returned  taliesin things are not going well have you heard any news of emon and what has been  transpiring there  matt no weve been focused on restoring our city why 
none	  taliesin yesterday we were attacked by a group of chromatic dragons the city is destroyed  theres no simple way to say this but were under siege we were afraid that whitestone would be  destroyed as well but it seems that they have passed over you so far but we fear for many  cities safety i was hoping that it would be all right if we moved a small number of refugees  through to whitestone for the time being less than a hundred i imagine these are the first  20someodd that weve pulled through  
town	 matt and she looks behind you looks to the crowd snaps her fingers some of the guards step  forward she goes  please if you would make sure to find any of the various unoccupied buildings are provided to these  refugees thank you  and the guards nod and begin gathering the group and sending them back into town and she gives you  a look back and says  for better or for worse we happen to have a number of vacancies in the city due to recent  events but  taliesin oh well yes nothing 
dung	 i anything i should know about  matt no just weve lost many in the struggle against the briarwoods but yes they will be  provided for i assure you  taliesin so i will let you know to stop all business with emon for now be very wary prepare  the city for a possible dragon attack things are looking dark  matt yes yes  taliesin and if its possible any research any energy that can be put forward towards mounting  some sort of defense against these creatures would be greatly appreciated  matt right right well 
none	 we had a few individuals that were researching the ziggurat  beneath the city two left a while back and we had one arrive just the other day  taliesin who arrived the other day  matt i cannot recall his name realm seeker realm seer im not  laura whispering eskil ryndarien  taliesin please bring me to him  matt all right cassandra leads you down into the city again and one of the houses has been  provided she knocks on the door the door opens and you see stepping out an older gentleman who  youve 
dung	 heard of but not really had an encounter with since no actually you encountered him for  the final ritual that took the phylactery from grogs chest  taliesin oh my god  matt but this is realmseer eskil ryndarien the archmage that basically was one of the folks who  lived within westruun and was called to whitestone as part of research  taliesin thats some prestream stuff everybody  matt as the door opens he comes out eyes adjusting to the light and you can see the  interior is very dark hes one of those liveinlightlessterritory types 
none	 of person comes  out with his round spectacles around his nose his robe is disheveled bundled over his shoulders he  goes yes if i may be of service  taliesin weve met you look very familiar  matt quite yes we have youre with those shits werent you  taliesin laughing ah yes  matt unfortunate title youve chosen  taliesin long gone thankfully long gone were vox machina  matt good vox machina glad you took my suggestion  taliesin yes thank you for that  laughing  matt what can i do for you  taliesin 
none	 well first of all how goes the research into the  matt frustrating to say the least it appears that this entire and he walks back into the  house expecting you guys to follow as you enter immediately youre hit with the smell of sage and  other burning herbs and you can see theres a vast number of books that are strewn about the  table in front the fireplace in the back is pouring smoke up into the roof area and soots starting  to gather on the stonework on the outside looks like theres two or 
none	 three different kettles going  off with different types of tea its complete chaos in here but he seems to be in control of  most of it at least he goes from best we can ascertain this is some sort of a magical siphon  device it has prevented us from utilizing any sort of ritualistic endeavors in ascertaining its  nature its quite perplexing im hoping to either head over to wildemount or perhaps return  to the cobalt reserve and perhaps find some historical information about such an object but  nothing in my current  taliesin 
none	 well sir i have some bad news for you i hail from emon which has been attacked by  chromatic dragons  matt im sorry what  taliesin dragons have declared war on civilization a group of dragons have destroyed  our city and they have destroyed other cities as well we are in desperate need of powers to defend  ourselves with so i would be very careful and send forward send word ahead of yourself before  you travel anywhere it may not be there by the time you get there  matt well i guess its good 
none	 that i moved my tower before i left  taliesin things are looking grim and i would ask while you if you intend to remain and work on  your research on this anomaly beneath our city perhaps thinking as to how it may be turned into a  weapon for our use against these creatures would not be out of the realm of question and any  information you do have of the chromatic dragons would be invaluable any research that can be  done we are at war  matt this is very disconcerting news i will do 
none	 what i can unfortunately id have to get back to  the cobalt reserve thats where most of my research is completed  taliesin thats westruun  matt let me see jeckt and he snaps his fingers and you can see his manservant jeckt  who youve met before slickedback darkish red hair mustache very prim and propertype  manservant welldressed steps out of the shadows  yes my lord  if you would be so kind prepare me for travel pack up this  taliesin westruun is no more sir  matt well thats really frustrating  taliesin yes 
none	  matt really  taliesin extremely aggravating  matt yes i am unhappy with this circumstance how am i supposed to do my research without a  place to do my research  taliesin well we hope that you will find our winters here quite solitary and convenient on  that level things are looking grim  matt well you can say that again  taliesin i must go i have other work to do to start preparing  travis peace  matt yes yes go do your thing  taliesin good day sir and good luck to you  
none	 matt should i find anything how will i whereabouts where are you  taliesin we dont know yet but we will be returning here  matt that does not help me i will do my best  taliesin cassandra will be able to get a hold of me if necessary  matt ah cassandra all right someone of use around here  taliesin i am going to go find my sister and make my way to the stone  matt he doesnt even say goodbye to you hes completely flustered its funny for everyone  whos taken completely by the 
none	 horror of the situation he just seems really perturbed about the  travis inconvenience of it all  matt yeah its so inconvenient that library was very helpful  taliesin why isnt the internet working frustrated noise  matt basically you find your way to cassandra again shes waiting outside of the room i hope  hes been helpful brother  taliesin no he wasnt helpful but it was very helpful the way he wasnt helpful  matt yes  taliesin its a strange strange  matt hes a very strange man  taliesin everythings going to be all right 
none	  matt i hope so  taliesin thank you i will return very soon we will again with your permission hopefully be  using whitestone as a place to regroup and prepare ourselves  matt is there worry that these dragons might come here  taliesin yes  matt how will we stop them  taliesin youll hide i have thoughts perhaps of a weapon i dont know but were going to find a  way to stop them  matt we have to  taliesin im not good at being the bearer of any bad news but this is 
none	 very dangerous and i dont  know what were going to do  sam whispers steal an airplane  matt neither do i  taliesin whispers they dont have an airplane  matt stay safe percival  taliesin i shall return soon  matt i hope so well do what we can in the meantime to see to your refugees and hopefully try  and prepare ourselves  taliesin there will be a few more through possibly tomorrow with word  matt all right well be prepared thank you  she reaches out and puts her hand on yours again 
none	 and looks you sternly in the face and goes be careful  taliesin i will  matt youre all i have left  taliesin and cassandra im proud of you youre doing very well here  matt theres still a ways to go brother  taliesin well get there  matt she hands you the gatestone and with that theres a slight popping sound as youre in a very  soft bit of bluishpurple light your body slowly subsides and fades into nothing before it poof  vanishes out of existence as you guys are back at the keep suddenly 
none	 who has the gatestone as  youre holding it it begins to shake in your hand and give off a warm light  marisha i think our reservations ready  sam im telling the what seven remaining refugees  matt you have about eight or nine  sam sorry you didnt make it through it doesnt mean that youll be here forever well get you  there tomorrow no big dont worry about it  laura more food for you guys which is a  matt at which point now theres a slight smell of burnt cedar before the air 
none	 itself begins to  sound like a light hum or vibration as suddenly percys form poof appears in the center of the  room next to your gatestone both of the stones you guys are holding all of a sudden become  whitehot and you instinctively drop them before they tumble to the ground  laura hey they work  taliesin they hurt good to know  sam thats great did you see your sister  taliesin i did everything is fine up there the research continues theyre happy to take people  laura thats wonderful  taliesin so and 
none	 they are prepared for more theyre also happy to be a base of operations as  we put things together  laura and you told them to make preparations in case something happens  taliesin whatever preparations one can make for something like this to be prepared to hide  sighs for now  liam in the worstcase scenario they can go underground  taliesin worstcase scenario they can go underground yes  laura they need to start hiding food  taliesin they have to grow food they havent really recovered that yet theres also a  marisha hopefully i 
none	 hooked them up there  taliesin i have one of those terrible ideas i get on occasion  sam what is it i love it  taliesin that thing beneath whitestone could be a weapon  sam how  travis ooh thats true  laura anything touching it disintegrates  travis yeah like a dragon  sam do you shoot it at something  taliesin i might be able to turn it into a projectile  laura how would you turn it to a projectile are you okay keyleth  liam it is a fun idea  taliesin a longterm 
none	 idea  marisha just choking on percys idea  taliesin i can make an antimagic missile  marisha what a magic a magic missile an antimagic missile  taliesin an antimagic missile  liam one plus one plus two plus one  laura one plus two plus one plus one  sam thats a great idea  taliesin ive been ive been mulling it over  sam could we fire it from an airship of some sort  taliesin yes i have thats actually part of the idea  marisha percy when i tried to touch that thing it was 
none	 like it was sucking me in i dont think  that thing and me touched how are we going to turn it into a projectile  taliesin i have thoughts im going to follow them through and it may require some  experimentation in the future but i think perhaps  marisha at the cost of possibly your life  taliesin i take my life into my hands any time i build something i think that a nonmagical  approach to containing it might actually work i think the problem is  laura well thats good because it cancels out 
none	 any magic  taliesin i think the problem is that we keep trying to magic our way out of something that  denies magic and maybe i can engineer our way out of it  marisha have they found anything out did you get any updates  taliesin a little bit of information there will be more later im going to take a look at all  the data and see if its possible  sam should we go visit the clasp  travis oh please  taliesin im trying to be more open  travis yeah lets go  
none	 marisha what time is it  matt at this time its pretty close to dusk the sun is getting close to the mountain line you  probably have another hour of daylight  marisha okay  taliesin to the clasp  travis yeah theyre probably nocturnal anyway that means theyre around at night  taliesin theyre not turtles no  marisha did you learn something new grog  travis what  matt all right you guys heading back into emon  sam everyone some all  taliesin i think pike should stay behind to take care for  marisha you 
none	 seem to have reservations  sam vex are you okay going down there youre marked for death by these people  laura ive been down there several times without knowing that  sam i know i feel like it might put you on edge  liam shes not marked for death she was marked for death its just awkward its awkward im  not a fullfledged member they dont like me i dont like them  laura maybe i can become a member  liam maybe you can  taliesin this is politics youre not supposed to like them  
none	 liam well lets go then  travis yeah what he said  matt you guys taking the tunnel or you walking in  laura taking the tunnel were taking the secret entrance  travis oh come on were never even weve not even walked in yet  laura garthok showed us the secret entrance hes waiting for us and having them prepare our way  this could get bad  matt no are you guys walking through your tunnel to the city is what im saying  laura oh that yes cool  liam were not going to walk in 
none	 the open  sam what are we doing  laura were taking our secret tunnel into the city  sam okay it puts us in the wrong side of the city but its okay  laura what else are we going to do  marisha coughing  laura how you doing there you okay  marisha im good mmhmm sorry i got a piece of chip stuck  taliesin no im going to leave one with vax  travis what is it  taliesin im giving vax my gatestone  liam thats a good idea  taliesin im giving you 
none	 the other one  liam for now its a good idea i wont hold onto it forever  taliesin hes the one whos going to get stuck in a room alone if they decide they dont like him  liam can we call this the jenga stone in moments of need  taliesin jenga stone remember it takes about a minute to work  liam do i need to spend a little time with this  matt no however it does work only once a day  liam once a day  matt after another long rest youd be able 
none	 to use it again  liam all right good to know all right  sam into the city  laura in your pants  matt like you do halfelven storage space you guys find your way back into emon utilizing your  secret tunnel entrance coming up through the false outhouse once again you leave the chain  behind locking it up and make your way into the city  laura cast pass without a trace on us  matt all right you guys id like you all to make a stealth check  travis come on giant blue nut 
none	 ball dice  natural 20  laura aw it fell out of my hand i dont think it should count if it fell  matt nope too bad  laura aw thats mean oh i get advantage  sam oh and we get a plus ten right  taliesin 33  sam 15  marisha 35  liam 38  laura 35  travis natural 20  sam wait with no judgment is trinket coming  laura trinket is staying with pike  sam thats a fine decision  matt okay  travis hell hath frozen over  matt placing 
town	 trinket over here  laura oh hes crying im crying  matt so as you guys start dodging between the alleyways making your way towards the north side  of emon alongside the ruined interior of the cloudtop district you instinctually begin to  and id say who else has proficiency in perception  liam right here  matt all right you guys all start noticing there are what looks initially like flocks of birds  moving through the sky some of them are heading down into parts of the town in the distance as  you continue to push 
dung	 forward one set of four in particular start heading overhead you look up and  you can see a small cluster of about five or six flying creatures not dragonsized by any means  but either a very very large bird or something of that degree you cant make out the details as  right now as the suns beginning to set a lot of its dark against a redorange sky you keep  yourself at bay waiting for them to pass  marisha oh waiting for them to pass  matt unless you guys want to do something else 
none	  laura as a dragonfavored enemy could i guesstimate what those winged creatures are that  would hang out around dragons  travis could you determine if theyre wyverns  matt yes they are actually indeed wyverns wivverns however you want to pronounce it both  work in my world its fine  liam its pronounced jif  matt yes  laughter  matt i will fight you but yeah  sam theyre diving into the city  matt you can see a few that dove into city and stayed there and one group goes overhead and  continues onward 
none	  marisha okay  matt pushing forward deeper into the city you make your way through the temple district and  start pushing through abdars promenade once again retracing your steps from the day before  dodging through open areas as fast as possible to stay within the shadows all of you go darting  into one of the alleyways as you turn behind you you can see your tinylegged gnomish bard friend  keeping up as best as he can before his foot hitting a divot on the ground and slam falling  face first on the ground making 
none	 just enough noise  sam sorry sorry  matt you hear a little screech in the distance screech and coming up on the rooftop you can  see perched up there appears to be one wyvern that is looking over down at the currently toppled  gnome and on top of the wyvern you see something riding it something that is holding reins on the  edge something humanoid is glancing over just a little enough of a shadow to see  sam he sees me i see him  matt he looks down at you yeah  sam okay 
none	 i will cast hold person on him  matt okay  sam i dont know what he is but i want him to stop  liam and scanlans the only one we all see it  matt you all barely see it looking over the edge as scanlans there left in the middle of the main  walkway that is going to be a natural 17 on the will save thatll be an 18 whats your dc  sam well its 17 but the handcone makes it 19  laura ahha  sam do you think i had the wherewithal 
none	 to use it  matt with having you fallen on your face id say probably not since it wasnt specified that  would be a dc of 17 so the creature seems to rear back for a second shake its head and you get a  little bit of a look at the features at this point too and it is humanoid but you can see  its outer body is not fleshy or smooth it is scaled and bumpy you can see ridges across the  back of the head and in one of the hands looks like some 
none	 sort of a spear immediately as it rears  back it puts its head up and goes guttural gibberish  laura the creature  matt yeah riding on the back of the wyvern  laura those are the things that attacked the airship  sam yes possibly  matt i would like you all to roll initiative  taliesin this is going to be fun  laura i think you should turn it into a bunny keyleth turn it into a bunny  marisha jesus christ i can do that today just rolled shitty on my initiative  liam not 
tavern	 too good  sam singing this is the music that plays when we fight  matt all right so scanlan as you were running across the thoroughfare you tripped and fell that way  sam thats me  matt the rest of you had come into this alley over here currently looking over the top of this  rooftop is this wyvern and its rider  marisha i love that the rider is like derpy noise  matt imitates derpy noise its fine  marisha go home rider youre drunk  matt thats going to be 25 to 20  
none	 taliesin 26  travis 20  matt 20 all right 20 to 15  laura 18  matt 18 lets see vex 15 to ten  sam yikes  matt ten to five  sam eight no seven  marisha five  matt laughs okay  taliesin wow  liam uno  matt plus  liam oh six thanks for that  matt so you would be actually technically keyleth is next to you  liam that was so crushing to see the number on the die  matt aw sorry buddy it happens to the best of us all 
none	 righty so currently with this guy up on  top of the rooftop percy you are first  taliesin quick question is he in flight or is he just sitting on the rooftop  matt just sitting on the roof perched on the edge you cant even actually see him everyone  else whos near the front can see the few that made the check youve got a little bit of  movement up there but youre just out of view with the building youre right in an alleyway  taliesin theres no easy way up onto the roof is 
none	 there  matt aside from a wellplaced acrobatics check you could try  taliesin that would be my whole movement too wouldnt it though  matt most likely  taliesin nah lets see  travis and how high is the roof  matt id say its about anywhere from 16 to 20 feet tall its twostory but its not extremely  wellbuilt  taliesin im going to try to get a vantage point where i can at least get where hes only  threequarters cover so i suppose im going to head south down the alley to see if i 
none	 can get a  matt pushing to these guys  taliesin yeah  matt okay so one you can get to about there if you want to  taliesin i can get a good look at him there  matt you can see yeah hell have halfcover from there  taliesin halfcovers fine so if i were to knock him prone would he fall off the roof or  could i try and push him off the roof these are my  matt for the wyvern or for the rider  taliesin the wyvern  matt you can try its 
none	 hardpressed hes sturdy on the side knocking him prone might fall over  onto the rooftop who knows if itll slide or not its your call what do you want to try  taliesin ill try knocking him prone and see if that does it  matt okay  taliesin actually  sam do it  taliesin yeah its either that or try and push him off the roof which could be pretty funny  ill try and knock him prone  matt okay  taliesin all right so im going to use bad news because thats funnier  matt 
none	 okay so whoosh you whip out  taliesin take a shot thats a 28 to hit  matt thatll hit  taliesin and thats a wing shot so you have to make a constitution saving throw  matt okay  taliesin against 18  matt well this is the wing or leg shot right  taliesin wing or leg shot im sorry thats a actually im sorry i have the new sheet  matt yeah new sheet on that one updated that  taliesin strength saving throw sorry strength saving throw against 18  matt okay thats a natural 19 
none	 plus four for strength so thats a 23 on the save  taliesin motherfucker but hell still take some damage  matt still takes damage though go ahead and roll  taliesin im going to take another shot at him too because eff that i was not quite prepared  for this 2d12 plus six four eight 14 points of damage  matt 14 points of damage nice all right  taliesin and im going to take a reload take another shot and try and knock him off the roof  matt go for it the same shot  taliesin 
none	 same shot ugh thats a three so that means i  matt misfire  sam clank  matt so first shot of bad news explosion noise echoes the sound of the blast rippling  through the nearby alleyways the blast hits the wyvern in part of its arm sending a spray of  blood as it shrieks in pain as you can see its rider is moved to the side and you see a second  head behind the rider from the reaction of movement looks like theres actually two of these  creatures riding on the back of this 
none	 creature as you go to reload bring bad news up again to fire  a second time you pull the trigger and theres a thump sound and you can see now a stream of  smoke pouring out the back of the gun itself and youre a little worried what this is going to do  if you dont fix it soon  travis look down the barrel  sam yeah thatll work  taliesin i can use my i actually cant do am i going to panic and try and fix this  matt next turn thats your movement 
none	 thats your three attacks do you have a bonus anything  taliesin i can im going to im going to throw an action surge and see if i can fix this  matt go for it go ahead and make your tinker check  taliesin yes yeah 14  matt so you spend your action quickly trying to fix the gun and get bad news back you manage to  clear the barrel get the pellet out as the rest of the team starts coming up with their turns  thatll be the rest of your action okay finishes percys 
none	 turn grog youre up  travis id like to hold my turn until it gets off the roof and maybe comes down to the ground  matt okay okay good to know lets see here it appears that my taliesin could you do me a  favor and hand me that box next to the fridge there  taliesin sure  matt thank you all right so grog as youre doing that the blasting sound of bad news that  echoed through you all of a sudden start hearing other shrieks in the distance like a call to arms  
none	 of a number of other entities  marisha oh boy  matt as you see a multitude of other winged creatures begin to arise in the distance  taliesin i shouldnt have gotten him that box should i  marisha was that in the box  travis yeah we could always run too  taliesin could  sam how far are we from the tunnel system far  matt youre a ways probably a good 25minute run theres another one on the roof over here  and theres one on this roof here each one of them with their own 
none	 riders as well  laura shit  matt now all right so for this turn this one leaps off and swoops down here to where percy is  while both of its riders leap off to the side one that leaps off and rushes over to scanlan on the  ground and this other one that gets right up next to percy this one goes flying forward and lands  in the center to about there two of its riders leap off this one stays up in the air over this  way in a flanking position or in a 
none	 visual perspective with two of its riders on its back  put them there  liam for clarification does this count as turns or are they since theyre coming late to the  party or this is just them in position  matt this is them now entering the fray  liam are they into the initiative order just gameplay talk  matt yeah well this is the initiative i rolled for them after being called by the guy who was  already shouting out into the air  laura oh right right right  matt you didnt see them 
none	 before given your perspective these guys leap off over here over  there okay so we have first the wyvern that swooped down on you percy is going to go ahead  and make an attack with its bite and an attack with its stinger as a multiattack so that first  strike that is going to be a the bite 13  taliesin that does not hit  matt the stinger however is a 19  taliesin im going to use my amulet of the shield and up my ac for that attack to 23 so  matt yeah 
none	 so that will miss so that uses the amulet good to know so the stinger goes to  strike you after the bite misses and as you grasp your chest you can see now an arcane barrier  shines in front of you and completely ricochets the stinger out into the air to the side as it  reacts angrily the other giant humanoid lizard creature thats coming towards you with a giant  heavy club is going to attempt to slam you with it  laura theres so many things  matt twice well its going to attack you 
none	 with its club thats going to be a 17  taliesin nope  matt and then its going to try and slam you with a spike shield that is 15  taliesin nope  matt so that guy starts swinging at you loosely  taliesin im sword out yeah  matt all right attacking you scanlan  sam oh shit  matt the one thats on the ground there all right so it has two attacks against you with  advantage  sam with advantage  matt because youre prone youre on the ground thatll be a 24 to hit 
none	  sam yeah yeah okay  matt and the spike shield is going to be a 24 again actually  laura oh no  matt so as youre on the ground it slams you with a shield for 12 points of bludgeoning damage  sam okay  laura why didnt i bring trinket  sam i know whats wrong with you  matt the shield slams you for eight points of piercing damage so a total of 20 points of damage  as whack slams you into the ground twice  laura i thought this was a stealthing mission  
none	 matt it was until he rolled a 15 stealth  sam blame me blame me  matt those wyverns are too far away for combat the other guys are just assisting the scenario here  liam percy shot at them  matt okay theres one fellow over here that is a bit far away who steps off instead of holding the  same clubs and shields or other various hack weapons hes carrying a gnarled staff  sam oh shit  matt steps forward and sees the weapon that you fired twice and had been fixing this large  metallic 
none	 dangerous entity looks forward and begins hissing under his breath hissing gibberish  sam do i see this  matt you do  sam im going to release my  matt though you are being slammed on the ground id say make a perception check actually to see  if you see this  sam okay  matt because you are currently  sam 19  matt yes actually i will say you do see this  sam i will release my counterspell  matt okay  sam i assume hes casting something  matt he is actually  travis 
none	 or has a terrible cold  sam and i will i will sing at him singing and you still havent hit what youre aiming for  matt thats a secondlevel spell it is dispelled immediately as hed attempted to heat metal on  your weapon you can see as the metal begins to glow for a moment and you could feel the heat  welling in your hand all of a sudden the spell crack is shattered like the sound of thin glass  in the distance as scanlan shouts to intercept its arcane ability that is going to end 
none	 their opening  turn that brings us down to the initiative order vex youre up  laura oh i think grog was before me  matt oh right grog youre holding your action first  travis right can i barrel down through the alley now that someones on the ground and race towards  the one thats nearest percy  matt ill say sure usually going forward if you hold your action thats just your action not  your movement you still move to the situation but ill let it stand for this its fine  travis ill remember that 
none	 going forward  matt yeah so youre going to tear down to this guy there  travis yeah i would like and i would like to swing twice with craven  matt go for it still maintaining your bonuses from last game by the way you havent taken a  short rest yet  laura oh my gosh  travis yes indeed  laura hes so strong from the last game  travis plus thats 26  matt 26 hits  travis and a 14 on the second one  matt 14 does not hit this is the great weapon 
none	 master  travis no these are regular attacks  laura you didnt rage yet  matt did you rage  travis yeah oh no i did not  matt do you want to rage as part of your bonus action to this  travis i would like to rage  matt okay figures all right so as your bonus action you go into a rage before you strike go  for it  travis 12 22 oh wait yep 22  matt 22 damage all right the second strike missed  travis oh thats right 22 thats it  matt 
none	 22 so you rush forward slam the sword into the side of the lizard creature it puts its  shield up and it manages to block most of the blow but it still slides off and slams into part  of its neck area it shoves the blade out however it fails its save  travis yes  matt take a strength point off of it and add that to what you have now whats your strength  currently  travis 22  matt so it goes up another plus one to attack and damage if it became 22 it 
none	 does  travis yes  matt all right grog that ends your turn vex youre up  laura is there anywhere i can stand that i get a good cone shape or am i all blocked in  matt you can try to move through you might get an attack of opportunity from the guy thats  attacking grog  laura okay how high is the roof next to me  matt its about 16 20 feet  laura could i acrobatics that shit up  matt you could try to go for it  laura okay  liam parkour

none	 laura shit laughs  matt what  sam do i keep hold of my guy  matt the riders fall also they both take an additional 14 points of damage to each of them  from the fall  marisha they all took damage and theyre on the ground now  matt lets see if it takes damage and makes a new saving throw against the spell does not make it  so it is still dominated  sam oh okay thank god  marisha i didnt fuck it up this time  matt but they are all all three 
town	 of them are considered prone for now they are all knocked prone  marisha cool thats my turn  matt all right ends keyleths turn at the top percy youre up  taliesin okay where am i i cant see  matt youre right here youre blocked in between the two buildings the mouth of the alleyway with  a wyvern and lizard creature right there standing before you  taliesin okay i have no advantage on any of these bastards at the moment if i were to attack  okay thats fine and how would you describe these are 
none	 like scaly people  matt this up close and personal they are humanoid in build they have you know stand up  upright they have long tails ridges across the head theyre bigger than an actual human and  theyre very muscular and the more you look at it you can see that their clothing they have  tattered cloth and leathers that have been haphazardly dyed in blood and gore to all be a  very very deep red color and theyre pretty uniform across what they are wearing  laura theyre an army  sam team colors  
none	 taliesin i think youve got that one guy covered at the moment so ill concentrate on thehmm  tough call tough call you know what ill have a little fun im going to pull my sword and im  going to take a slash at the guy whos involved with  matt all right go for it  taliesin thats 21  matt 21 hits  taliesin oh shit i forgot to use my bonus action can i pop in a quick bonus before that  matt for what  taliesin hex him  matt youve already hexed today you 
none	 used it in the battle versus the looters  taliesin oh its  sam same day  taliesin thats right still the same hour it can only do it once a day right thats all  right thats fine i can just do a little thing so just add to this would he be described in  anywhere on his little dd card as something with a dragon keyword  matt nope  taliesin so im just going to do normal damage to him  matt yes  taliesin okay so  matt wyverns however  taliesin all right just 
none	 checking im going to do nine points of damage slashing damage to him  matt all righty  taliesin and im going to turn to the wyvern and take two slashes at the wyvern  matt go for it  taliesin first is ew 14  matt 14 hits  taliesin wow  matt theyre sacks of hit points but they dont have lot of armor to them  taliesin thats 19 plus 26 points of damage  matt nice  taliesin and second shot 13 24 yeah that hits ten 17 18 19 26 points of damage  matt 
none	 26 twice in a row so with this you pull the sword out as soon as you see it in the proximity  of the wyvern the blade itself almost seems to shimmer with this gleam of green on it like the  metal almost seems to bend and wave with your movements and as you turn back around to slash at  the wyvern the blade cuts through it like butter theres not even resistance it goes right through  its flesh with each slash of the longsword you can see large chunks of its muscle coming visible  
none	 as parts of its body are now being pulled from the muscle and sinew it shrieks in pain you can see  it angrily now starting to get ready to rake at you pretty heavily that end your turn  taliesin thats my turn  matt all righty grog youre up  travis yeah im going to continue where i started on shitfucker out in front of me  matt okay laughs  travis but i would like to go great weapon master and i would like to use reckless attack  matt go for it  laura wow wow 
none	 wow  sam reckless  matt roll your first attack against him  travis thats a 31  matt roll damage on that  travis 25  matt 25 he fails his save so you get another plus one to your strength and that swing just  cleaves it in two it goes whoosh right through its midsection it gurgles it tumbles off  falling to the ground  laura oh my god grog  liam grog is full juicing  travis i told you hed open up to me  laughter  matt you can move in now with 
none	 your movement and do your next attack if youd like  travis ill go ahead and take care of that wyvern thats next to me  matt go for it all right so now you get your next attack  travis natural 20  matt go ahead and roll damage  liam does his strength go up to 100 eventually  matt its double your first dice roll  travis 19 oh so the 2d6 was nine plus five is  matt so 18  travis plus 11  matt so 29 plus two additional die rolls  travis ten 
none	  matt okay so were at  matt travis and marisha 39  matt and then one more because you roll 2d its twice because of brutal critical  liam jeez you got like tetsuo arm its like five times bigger than it should be  travis four four for those two do i plus five to that as well for the  matt well plus ten for your you already added that for your  travis yes 2d6 plus five on each one and the  matt no its just the additional 2d6 each time  travis yeah  
none	 matt so yeah with that you turn around after hacking its friend leaping forward grunts foam  at the corner of your mouth your eyes bloodshot and angry you take the blade and sweep it down  and it plunges itself right into the wound that percy had left open with his sword swing finding  no resistance before it comes all the way to the hilt in the body of the wyvern which shrieks for  a moment screeches before its breath stops and its body falls limp  sam yeah one down  matt does make its save 
none	 though  travis oh yeah and on great weapon master on a crit or killing an extra hit but i guess i  matt as a bonus action for the record going forward if youre frenzied raging it doesnt  really give you a benefit but if youre not it does help so in theory you could if you wanted  to try and chuck it  travis laughs just throw it dont throw it  matt what are you going to do grog  travis im good im good  matt ends grogs turn all right now these guys 
none	 both get up currently no longer on the wyvern  did you want to give it another kind of a thought if you see it land  sam get on the wyvern and kill the other one  matt okay this guy gets up on the wyvern grabs its reins pulls it forward and jams it with its  spear as it leads it inward it runs forward and is going to take a swing its going to take a  swing with its stinger at the one behind it its confused and figuring out whats why is it doing 
none	  this its more of like this might work once that is going to be a 17 it hits thats going  to be 11 points of damage does it make its save it does not make its save thats an additional 24  points of poison damage on that one so thats 35 points of damage one wyvern to another laughs  as this guy immediately whips around angrily  sam you have pleased me  laughter  matt both of these guys go charging forward here  laura oh no scanlan  matt its going to pull up 
none	 its javelin and chuck it at you vex  laura me  matt yeah that is going to miss you at a 12 it swoosh throws the javelin arcs past you this  one over here is going to come forward and its going to take a javelin as well out and chuck it  right at you grog  travis heh youre dead  matt that is a 20 to hit  travis hits  matt you take ten points of piercing damage reduced to five as you basically impact  travis snapping noise  matt laughs snap it 
none	 off and grin in its face  travis let me return that favor in a second  liam grog is on god mode  marisha laughs save game plus  matt laughs now it sees the danger that youre in looks at you sees you hack through the  center of one of the wyverns intensely looks at you and begins casting another spell  travis oh shit  matt like it is wont to do  marisha is it  travis come on smart grog  matt all right so craven edge as youre holding it all of a 
none	 sudden the handle becomes  white hot and you immediately take six points of fire damage just holding it  sam grip it harder groan  matt fires biting through three attacks against you scanlan  sam oh god  matt currently two of which are flanking you so theyre going to have advantage on the attacks so  thats a natural 20 on one of them  this guy is 18 that hits and then this guy here without the advantage still hits with a 17  sam im going to use cutting words on the last guy  
none	 matt okay  sam im going to just plays flute badly to distract him  matt okay go ahead and roll a d10  sam d10 which ones ten i never remember this one nine  matt okay so he rolled a 17 plus seven that wouldve been a 24 that brings him to 15 which i  believe misses you so the last strike as he swings towards you the shrilling tones it causes  him to reach up and grab one of his lizardlike ear holes and snarling the swing goes wildly  over your head however as 
none	 you duck down you look up as you see the shadow come down of two  large clubs that boom boom over the head of your tiny gnomish form thats going to be groans  sam oh thats not a good sound  matt oh and they also get bites after this too all right so you take 12 which would double to  24 oh no sorry 12 20 points of bludgeoning damage from one you take 12 points of damage from  the other so 32 points of damage total and theyre both going to attempt to bite 
none	 you as well  with advantage  sam a bite with advantage  matt that is a 20 on the first one  sam thats the damage it does  matt thats to hit and that ones going to  double 19 so they both hit so you take another  20 points of damage total of piercing damage as they both start tearing into your body  laura 52 points of damage just then  sam rasping breath  laura no scanlan  marisha no youre still up youre still up i thought you said you had 55  
none	 sam i did  laura 52  marisha it was 52 total  laura you have three points left  sam ah that was close guys i saw my mother then i saw myself at math class failing  matt i need you to make a bunch of concentration checks here  sam oh yeah okay  matt to maintain control over it yeah  sam advantage on concentration checks  matt yeah so just roll two at a time  sam two whats  matt two d20s  sam well i only have one d20  matt adding your 
none	 constitution modifier to it  sam how many oh for each thing that constitution modifier holy god okay im  counting both of those the first ones only 12  matt 12 thatll work because none of them only one of them did 20 damage and its minimum of  ten so as long as you get above a ten with each one youre fine  sam okay so i got to do two more  matt yeah  sam yeah thats 16 plus two  matt okay another one  sam 17 plus two  matt another one  
none	 sam two plus two  matt you have advantage on these  sam seven plus two nine  matt nine nope  sam no good no bueno  matt with that you lose your concentration on the domination spell as that fades  laura thats okay the other wyvern is still mad at the first one so thats good  matt so that ends their turn vex youre up  laura oh man okay  matt you see scanlan being tossed around on the ground and then you see streaks of blood in the  air as one of them 
none	 tears a big chunk out of his shoulder  laura yeah  matt he looks up at you briefly his eyes halfopen  laura scanlan i got you  sam no no i know you did you shot me on the last turn i remember yeah you got me good you  got me good  laura i shoot from my bow of the sky sentinel  matt sky sentinel i believe did you use that last battle  laura fuck  matt im pretty sure you did  laura i did but i only used my burning thingy once

none	 damage so far and then as part of the poison  you take 48 points of poison damage because you have resistance that is reduced to 24  sam hey thats nice  matt all right you have poison resistance from the belt right yes all right so there you go  the other one coming up against you percy strikes with its bite that is going to be a 20 16  taliesin 16 misses  matt 16 misses that is going to be a 22 for the stinger  taliesin stinger hits  matt okay stinger hits you

none	 23 growling 29 36 39 41 for the first dagger  matt how do you want to do this  cheering  liam i will aim for its open mouth as its going huah and pin its tongue into the back of its skull  matt as you step forward your first dagger you pull it out and aim it and overthehand toss it  as it rears back ready to bring its fangs out to sink down into percy the dagger vanishes into its  throat and you see its face go lax for a second wet coughs it 
none	 begins trying to cough and as it  does you can see bits of blood and gore from its throat being hawked across the ground it takes a  few steps percy steps out of the way as it heads towards you before it rears back and  choking thump and collapses onto the ground you can see the blade still sticking out the back of its head  towards the back of its throat before it appears at the side of your belt  sam sorry i made a noise guys sorry  laura next time stealth we should 
none	 get inside  travis yeah  laura we should hide  taliesin we should we should take what we can and we should also hide the bodies  laura good call  taliesin lets bring everything inside  marisha i go down to the wyverns and i start going for those stingers  matt okay  laura if you can do this quickly keyleth because we need to hide these bodies  matt its going to take you a while to do it  liam can i assist with my keen dagger and help her under her instruction  laura 
none	 lets get them inside  liam were going to drag the wyverns indoors  taliesin drag everything indoors  sam wait wait wait these stingers are on the end of tails  liam and taliesin yeah  sam grog can you chop off their tails and well take the tails with us  laura no weve got to get the wyverns inside if anything flying overhead sees these bodies they  know somethings been attacked  sam arent half of them burned to a crisp anyway  taliesin not crisped just scorched  marisha theres some ash i go ahead 
none	 and i do a cantrip gust and start spreading out the ash  matt okay it still looks like someone emptied a bunch of fireplace ash pits into the center of the  walkway where there once were lizardfolk  laura ill have the bag  travis what for  laura just the dust of tracelessness  sam i give us cover ill blow my horn of fog  laura i start putting the dust of tracelessness down on the ground so it looks like  nobodys been here  matt low fog sound as scanlan blows the horn fog 
none	 fills the vicinity and you guys begin tossing dust  of tracelessness around  travis i go grab the humanoid figures and i throw two over my shoulders and then i get one in each  hand and i start dragging them toward a door  taliesin any inside just inside  travis to an any inside  liam ill get the door for you door creaks  matt all right you guys pretty quickly manage to move what you can out of the way well say over  the next few minutes the fog is there under that cover 
none	 you begin to drag the wyvern bodies into  the alleyway into the shadows if you want to go ahead and make some checks here to go ahead and  see if you can harvest  marisha yeah okay lets do different ones okay so first one ill definitely take  advantage so since i have advantage not that much better 14 the first one  liam would it help if i gave her my keen dagger for the rest of it  matt i would say given the circumstance all it would do would offer her advantage which she 
none	  already has so it wouldnt make much difference so the first one its been a little too damaged  in battle and you arent able to really draw any poison from the stinger for the first one whats  the second one  marisha second one 15 total  matt 15s what you needed you manage to extract just enough of the wyvern stinger poison for  possibly a single dose so you can mark down a dose of wyvern poison  marisha okay ill give it to ill give that to vax do you have poison or do 
none	 you vax or vex  i give it to one of the twins here twins you fight over it fight over it  laura is it good for you  liam yeah  marisha two more maybe i can 14 okay well the second one i rolled a 25  matt okay so thats a second dose of wyvern poison  marisha that i give to vex last one ill take that 15 with 26  matt all right so you have three doses of wyvern poison that youve managed to harvest from these  creatures you guys can distribute 
none	 as you see fit  taliesin anything else to loot from these schmuckuses  matt they dont carry much gold and what they have you envision probably went to the entity  that rules emon and as youre looking over the bodies of the few of the lizard men here you see  they didnt just wander their way in here and you remember mention from allura before that there  were lizardfolk worshipers of thordak years ago apparently once the citys been taken thordak  has or at least the worshipers of thordak are also moving in so taking 
none	 this time to harvest  poisons looking over the bodies you can see the consistency between their red crimsondyed  leather materials and you get the sensation that while this was a small skirmish group this is  probably the new policing state of emon so with that well take a quick break for the restroom  well pick up here in just a few minutes guys if you want to hang tight  and well see you here shortly  jumping back in as the party regathers themselves after the battle with these lizardfolk  and the wyverns in 
none	 the center of the city of emon you slowly make your way back through the streets  towards the north passing through abdars promenade finding the building that was  previously brought to your attention thanks to garthok  laura should we take a short rest though before we head down to the clasp because some of us have  taken some hits  taliesin well take a breath in the  laura okay before we head down  taliesin yeah in the basement  matt so you guys find the building that was brought to your attention you head 
none	 down into the  same cellar keeping tabs on the external trap that was brought to your attention by garthok last  time you make your way inside theres the same barrel in the far corner you pull the top off and  there indeed is a ladder that leads down underground  laura this is why i left trinket because he wouldnt have been able to come down here anyway  just so you know  travis hey search that shit vax  marisha hes very claustrophobic  liam so weve just got ladder down thats it  marisha 
none	 well hang on lets heal up i need to hit dice it up as well  liam well im fine so while everybody is  travis i would not like to take a short rest  laura oh  travis i lose all my fancy feast if i do  liam just do some pushups just do some pushups while i check this ladder out so im going to  check for any traps on this ladder or anything  travis oh yeah yeah yeah can she heal me instead  laura ill heal you im going to heal you 
none	  liam 23  matt okay looking at the barrel there are no traps currently set and its not locked the only  traps were on the outside of the cellar from what you knew previously and as that mechanism had  already been shown to you by garthok so that was easily disabled  liam im not going to go crazy im just going to go to the bottom of the ladder in i go  matt okay so while you guys are taking a rest  liam 30 for stealth  matt you drop down the ladder as 
dung	 you head down what probably comes to about 15 20 or so feet  into pitch black its completely dark down there do you have any light source or do you  want to  liam i have a flame tongue dagger  matt okay so you pull the flame tongue dagger it puts out a very very low candlelight opens up  the vicinity to you as your feet splash down into very very shallow a couple inches shallow  water looking around you you are in a subterranean sewer system the smell hits you as  you hit 
none	 the bottom of it this is the entire underbelly of emon and there is the slight sound  of trickling water thats rushing through this tunnel youre currently standing in the ladder  drops close to about a foot above the floor before it comes to a complete stop looking to your  right it descends a little further down on that side and you can hear make a perception check  liam 22  matt okay to the right of you what should be the eastern tunnel you can hear the sound of  trickling water growing louder its 
none	 almost like this stream meets another as you listen to the  left and the stench is pretty rough in this part to the left you can see in the tunnel is a very  very faint dim yellow light that is shifting ever so slightly in the distance as it curves around  out of view it is level to where you are now actually slight incline for a little bit  liam quietly vexahlia there is a long tunnel down here and there is a bit of faint light i  have percys fancy rock i am not 
none	 planning on doing anything crazy but i think i should  laura you dont have the the rock doesnt work until we sleep you dont have anything  liam well technically i do still have it regardless i should go ahead and if theres  anyone to talk to i should talk im not going to go yet im going to wait til you guys have  rested and come down to its pitchblack down here im not running ahead im better at this  shit than you and the rest are so take a rest im going to sit 
none	 here  laura youre better at talking than the rest of us are  liam sometimes stubby yes  laura how will i know if you get into trouble and your hands are tied  sam do you need me to come  laura we can all hear you  laughter  liam stubby could you come down here for me  marisha hi vax  laura hold on just a moment mind the gap  matt you splash down into the sewer system  laura eugh fuck it smells down here  liam yeah  laura do i have 
none	 to step in the water  liam probably come here  laura yes  liam all right so before all these guys you were being stalked by someone i dont know for  what reason i dont know who the person was i dont know what they wanted with you  laura stalked  liam someone wanted you and i dont know who the clasp was going to get you for them and i  stopped that from happening i followed you one night or rather followed this person following  you and met the clasp and i made an 
none	 exchange for your life  laura what  liam i went and got someone else and  laura and said it was me no  liam not immediately youre almost on it they told me to get a body i got a body a living  body a child rapist and brought him to the clasp and they brought out a stick really it  was made of human tongues  laura a stick of human tongues  liam yes they touched it and he turned into you  laura what the fuck  liam and they took that guy 
none	 for whatever and in exchange for your life i have this and they are  allowed to call on me when they want so i know that weve run in and out a couple of times but  were going in you can talk my fucking ear off in a moment all right just shut up for a second we  are going to go in and try to form some sort of alliance or working partnership this is different  than running in smashing some shit and running out all right so keep the cloak up hang back  
none	 dont say a lot and you can talk my ear off later  laura okay i will do that i want to know that tongue guy that looks like me is he dead or is  he alive now they gave him to some stalker some stalker  liam i dont know why you were wanted i dont know what it was about all i knew is that they  were going to take you away and i wasnt going to let that happen and i took some fucking piece of  shit and traded him in  laura so 
dung	 there could be at this moment in time another person that looks just like me parading  around the world  liam well if i had to wager on it id say that hes in a dungeon in a rubber suit but i dont  know where no  laura well thank you for you know doing that nervous laugh  liam i never told you because its creepy as fuck  laura was it the clasp here was it the clasp in westruun  liam it was in westruun  laura well these guys probably dont know me

none	 sewer system the choice is to travel to the east or western side of the tunnel  liam sounds like theres i dont know drainage or something coming from slightly up in that  direction  laura im guessing towards the light is where they are scanlan  sam oi  laura do you have something that can make disguises dont you have like not the mustache  but something that can really change my looks  sam how do you know im scanlan i could be in disguise but yes i do  laura could i use that  
none	 sam you would have to attune it to yourself is that right  laura oh it takes like a little bit  sam oh no no no requires attunement what do you think  liam well thats not a bad idea but it means weve got to sit in this stank  sam i can instantly make us with seeming i can instantly make us all look different  or just you  laura or just me how about just me ive got a question though heres the thing if you think  that they know what i look like 
none	 dont you think they know what you look like because you  look just like me so what difference does it make if im there or not  liam i dont know if the person who wanted you was part of the clasp i dont know who it was  its parading you around in front of the people who made an illicit deal with me  laura all right all right all right seeming how about that  liam it could be fine i dont know  laura okay seeming  sam yeah no  laura please  sam

none	 the water continues sloping downward this way the opposite  direction is where the light is the little bit of light you see in the distance  taliesin i say we follow the water  liam follow the water down or follow the light  marisha follow the water towards the light right  travis jesus what the fuck are we doing here  liam this is like the underdark again  sam i abstain  laura lets go towards  marisha towards the light  taliesin ill do whatever they say  marisha are we going towards the light

none	 liam 31  laura oh he doesnt need my help  matt looking along the walls you start heading in that direction you do see a few markings that  basically say sanctuary in thieves cant in the direction of the light  liam all right confirmed  matt you guys continue onward  liam yeah ill lead the way yeah we sat here for 20 minutes in the stank  matt yes clears throat so you guys continue forward up that tunnel eventually as it curves  around the light you can see its shifting because it appears to 
none	 be a distant fire light that  is the source in this vicinity and as you turn the corner as the tunnel slowly curves around it  opens up into a large central sewer chamber though most of it is dry and you can see there is  a large mound of dirt in the center that seems to rise above most of the water that has collected  along the ceiling and there are a series of platforms constructed out of wooden scaffolding at  different levels all throughout this chamber some of it looks a little rickety some 
town	 of it looks  very old but various states of moisture rot  offscreen sneeze  matt you hear a sneeze from the distance from one of the  laughter  matt as you look and see a series of small bonfires throughout the room that are currently  lit and surrounded by figures you see a ramshackle tent city andor a series of small  wooden hovels that have constructed here you see a number of figures that are huddled around these  bonfires cloaks hoods up generally keeping warm in what is a relatively cold subterranean area  
none	 you guys glancing over here as youre first looking and you can see a few of them appear to  be laid up and hurt and there appear to be at least a few individuals that are heavily bandaged  or have slings on as you guys step into the room not being very stealthy in your arrival  liam we could have been but i use a bit of sign language from the cant and let them know that im  part of the clasp  matt okay a few of them stand up hands on the side of 
none	 their hilt and stop there for a second  before one individual steps out of the shadows and puts his hand up putting it down you recognize  this to be garthok  sam garthok  matt he says dont worry theyre with me im glad you made it it had been a while i was  afraid maybe you wouldnt come  sam we got held up by some wyverns i almost died it was crazy were here now  matt it sounds like it im sorry to hear it  sam hey its all right  matr im 
dung	 glad you stayed alive and as he starts to talk the group of individuals standing  about ten feet behind him separate as another figure pushes past them pulling the hood back  you can see a man about six feet in height average human height long blond hair that trails  past the middle of his back over a dark grey cloak fine features at one time he looks older  you can see the weathering in his face and the various wrinkles and lines from years and years of  living in this atmosphere  liam you said 
none	 human right  matt human yes he has a redtinted monocle over one eye  sam ooh i like him already  matt as he steps forward the rest of the clasp put their hands off to the side of their weapons  he pushes aside garthok to the rest of you and says so you are the ones called vox machina am  i correct in this assumption  sam yes you are  matt hmm trusted of uriel executors of modeth the traitor one among you is a member as well  im told  liam i step 
none	 forward  matt then you are welcome here i am spireling shenn  sam whispers spireling shenn  marisha murmurs hes a spireling  matt master of networks and information  sam and marisha ooh  matt of the clasp of emon excuse the mess we lost a portion of our territory and are currently  caught in midadaptation so what can i do for you  liam well you know who we are  matt and you know who i am now  liam yes and you know my spotty track record with the clasp but thats all past 
none	 now the  citys in ruins youre looking at the right hand of uriel  matt uriel is no longer with us you are a hand to nothing  liam of course were looking for what to do next with this city i dont think any of us wish to be  the pets of the beast thats now roosting in the heart of emon  matt chuckles no that does not do any of us any good business has ground to a halt and weve  lost a few good patrons in this unfortunate circumstance we lost our entire 
none	 northern tunnel  structure as soon as the creature attacked the cloudtop district  liam well ill be honest our first thought was to flee this city  matt safer  liam but before we make that decision yes it is we know that youre the next best thing to a  government in emon  matt hmm  liam and we want to know whats left behind  matt well were seeing to our own were going to see how many of our allies still lie within the  city going to reach out to our friends across taldorei 
none	 and see how much of a network we still  stand to keep then we call in a few debts reach out to some friends and ah we see if we can find  some way to supplant this red thing  liam can i insight check  matt go for it  liam not good no nine  sam nine you said  liam nine the plan now is to lay low and hide  matt well for now i have a number of operatives topside who are currently trying to get  as much information on the red 
none	 one as possible the piles of wealth are growing and it looks like  the beast is building a damn home out of the district  taliesin the citys going to need a black market  matt oh i am aware and we are preparing for that however its still fairly fresh and  individuals arent willing to release any coin when all of it goes to the pouches of the thing  that sits on us word has gotten back that westruun was also hit rather hard in the night  and these creatures have continued eastward ever since 
none	 no further word on their whereabouts so  were put in a reactionary position which i loathe were used to being ahead of the rest of  the curve  taliesin well heres where we could help each other  matt it would appear that could be a possibility  taliesin we need this city to stay alive we need the citizenry to be fed and we need people to  know where theyre going to get their medicine and when theyre going to get their food we  understand its going to be tricky we need information we need 
none	 spies we need to know whats  happening in the city and you need people like us to stay out of your way  matt that seems like a fairly topheavy trade in our direction if you ask me there are many ways  to get people out of our way  taliesin there are ways that we can benefit each other  matt i would love to hear it  sam whispers i would too  taliesin we have safe haven and please by the way stop me if you feel im being too broad  sam no go 
none	 for it  taliesin we have our keep that is untouched by the dragons attack we have a safe haven  matt hmm how is this keep accessed  liam we can get to that  taliesin there are options  liam we also have strong connections to whitestone  laura and vasselheim  sam and to the slayers take thats what theyre called right yes there could be a  formidable force that could come to protect the city or drive out the dragons  liam were proposing a shortterm solution you want to get back to a position 
none	 where you can  grease the wheels and make money thats not going to happen anytime soon but you cant take care of  these beasts on your own and neither can whitestone neither can we  taliesin but it is very likely that we will be the thing that is dropped upon it from a great  height and the most cooperation we can get getting into a position of power over this beast  the happier well all be  matt hmm lets say we do this lets say we go forward with this alliance you get out 
none	 of our  way you promise resources from whitestone perhaps they have quite a few unique  contributions they could make the slayers take i have not had many dealings across the ozmit sea  but are you referring to ah vasselheim  sam indeed they are a mighty force  matt now that is a tough nut to crack that city if youre connected in vasselheim perhaps  we can talk  laura theres no guarantees youll be able to get in anywhere  matt theres no guarantees well be able to provide food or medicine its dangerous times 
none	  my dear  laura it is but the sooner these dragons are defeated the sooner business can get back to usual  matt of course  laura ow i mean fake coughs eh  sam i know im getting a bit ahead of ourselves but once the dragons are gone and the citys  returned to normalcy what is your ultimate goal to hold power or to remain in the underbelly  matt all the real power lies in the underbelly my friend i have a proposition for you then we  will do this we have many channels 
town	 and secret tunnels throughout the city and we could very  easily deliver food medicine shelter even to the wired and poor and downtrodden folk of this  town be the subterranean heroes of emon out of the goodness of our hearts of course however  once this creature is toppled and the city is brought toward i gather you would have the ear  of whoever comes to power in this city  sam we may very well be the person that comes to power in this city  matt that is helpful and i imagine you also have 
town	 some presumably powerful connections in  vasselheim we would be interested in beginning a sect of our fair trade in that distant alltoo  how do i put it xenophobic cityscape  travis what  matt if you agree to be our seed in that stubborn garden of a town you have our aid  marisha can you give us a moment softly please  matt my patience grows thin  marisha whispering can we talk about this for a second guys  matt he adjusts the monocle on his eye  marisha do we really need them are they 
none	 really providing us with enough to make this worth our  while to where we essentially want to open up the pandoras box of crime in vasselheim do we want  to be responsible for that  travis well im all about pandora and her box but i dont think we really need this its not  worth all of that especially if were going to vasselheim  marisha i feel like we just took one pretty topheavy deal and traded it for an even more  topheavy deal not in our favor  taliesin oh no im not i 
none	 feel the urge to further discuss this also to be fair were not  representatives of the clasp we couldnt technically speaking open all we can do is i  think the most fair thing to do to offer in exchange for this is perhaps some trade with the  materials that are available in whitestone and maybe a promise of keeping a blind eye towards  their business until the finished reconstruction of the city let them reestablish themselves until  the city is properly completed  laura dont say that  taliesin you need an underbelly underbellies are 
none	 function underbellies function for this very  need the fact that we can actually get food and medical supplies into the city right now if we  need to less than 72 hours after such a devastating attack theres no other system  liam if the clasp were to vanish something else would take its place  taliesin theyre inevitable  laura but i dont want to introduce them to vasselheim no  taliesin at the cost of people starving or not starving  laura were already here keyleth  marisha im down for joining them and letting them join 
town	 our cause and using their  infrastructure but beyond that  liam can i use perception to make sure that were really private right now  matt make a perception check  laura can i join in  liam 22 oh 22 plus can i use my inspiration on this  matt whend you get that inspiration die  liam i got it in the wyvern fight  matt it wouldve faded by now unfortunately  liam okay so 22  laura 33  matt 33  youre far away from the crowd however spireling shenn has been very concentrated 
none	 in  shifting his attention from each person that is currently speaking in this conversation  marisha hes reading our lips  laura i turn my back to him and i say he can read our lips as well as i can  taliesin of course he can which is why im not saying anything that i wouldnt want him to hear  anyway i just dont want to promise anything we cant deliver i dont think we could deliver  vasselheim were going to be busy we have too much on our plate as it is  laura i 
none	 dont think theyd listen to us anyway honestly  taliesin im going to offer what we can give and see if thats enough  sam we have to have something to sweeten the pot  marisha yes  sam what are you offering money  laura offering to sweeten the pot were defeating a fucking dragon let them get back to normal  sam we cant promise that the dragon could very easily kill us  laura we could say they certainly cant do it without us and we cant do it without them but  well be bringing in 
none	 other armies with us  marisha i agree its joined forces at this point thats all we can offer them a place to  fight at our side  travis youre still assuming hes going to keep his word too  taliesin let me go back to him deep sigh shenn  matt yes hmm  taliesin i propose a counteroffer i just dont feel comfortable offering vasselheim i dont  think that we could necessarily deliver and we honestly have a lot to do  matt all im asking is an introduction to a handful of key figures in 
none	 the city no more than that  taliesin well i will not promise that now what i can promise right now is some access to  materials from whitestone which and i show him my gun hilt which is embedded with the gems i  can see whats still lying around and we can make a deal i can also promise that for the  reconstruction once this has been dealt with which is in everybodys best interest until such  time as theres a functioning government in this city you will be treated with the respect  appropriate of 
none	 a group of people who are helping keeping the city functional  matt you act like that hasnt been our treatment for the entirety of this citys existence you  think your council didnt have dealings with the clasp for many years before this happened  taliesin of course they have  matt we helped make this city function all were offering is this service to other places  that maybe dont have the right guidance to achieve their true greatness all i ask is an  introduction beyond these other far after the fact dont even need to worry 
none	 about it now whos  to say what changes from now to then  laura who would we even introduce you to  marisha we dont even know anyone  sam yes we do we know some highranking clerics we know the slayers take we met a bunch  of people up there  marisha in a zealot city you want to go to a cleric and be like hey thought you might want  to meet the underground mob boss  matt we dont have to worry about that now just a simple handshake and its all done  
none	 taliesin ill put something forward to the group if they prove themselves honorable if they prove  themselves faithful and capable of keeping this city afloat then we will speak to whomever they  wish us to speak to precisely of what they did no more no less  matt if this is an issue of morality i would like to remind you that one weve let you escape  after murdering one of our leaders only upon learning that he himself was an immoral  individual  liam youre welcome  matt also we went against our word as 
none	 an organization by letting you take a war criminal  that had already paid his way out of the city  taliesin and for that we are grateful  laura and we gave you something very powerful in exchange  marisha and you got to keep that mans money  taliesin that was business  matt it was business but business that was persuaded by the actions of good people and  bringing justice we want society to thrive  taliesin im willing to kick this ball down the field  travis what  matt so not wasting any more 
none	 time shall we make this a fine healthy city once again  taliesin this feels a fair deal to me and it means that we can leave knowing that the city  will in fact still have a populace while were gone  marisha you seem used to selling your soul percy  taliesin it is the job of ruling  sam if we come back and learn that you have made a deal with the dragons youll be the first to  die not them  matt oh i would only hope that would be the case i wouldnt 
none	 be caught dead dealing with such  a selfish entity  sam all right then lets do this keyleth shake the mans hand  taliesin you dont have to  sam youve got nice soft hands  taliesin vax  travis it should be vax  taliesin this is not the worst deal ive ever heard  marisha you just dont know that yet  matt i have things to do  taliesin i have met the devil thats not him  laura dont do it  marisha percy you make me so nervous  taliesin thank you  matt 
none	 i havent all day my arm grows weary with impatience  marisha vax  sam would you like me to sing to give you some extra strength for that arm  taliesin vax i will make the deal if youre not up to it but i want your blessing  liam you know what keep your deal  travis yeah attaboy  sam were going to leave the city abandoned  travis yes  sam with no one to protect it  marisha we are not abandoning it we already discussed it theres more than one way to cut  
none	 through this knot  liam i dont think youre going to let this city fall anyway if this city dies youve nothing  marisha i agree  liam if the parasite hasnt a host to feed on the parasite dies no thank you  marisha percy im sorry but i think our methods of being rulers might differ i dont think i need  to sell myself for the greater good  matt very well unfortunate as it is step forward  liam is this a whisper  matt no this is him asking you to step forward he steps 
none	 really close to you and he takes you by  the shoulders and turns you around to face away from him do you resist  liam im going to roll out of his hands forward to my friends  matt okay make an acrobatics check  liam 28  matt 28 you tumble away from his grasp and he grunts very well i know your face now at  least and the rest of the clasp will know you are a false member now you are not welcome in these  tunnels ever again and if we see your face 
none	 amongst our kind it will be our word that you are  to be taken on sight its a shame youve marked yourselves our enemy this day i wish it wasnt  this way but to step up and confront us with such disrespect for all the patience weve shown you in  previous years is just it irks me stinks of a lack of civilization so please be on your way  well do as we do you do as you now be gone and he turns around flicks his cloak and steps  back into the group the 
none	 rest of them keep their hands on their belts and wait for you to leave  sam i look at garthok and say even you  matt garthok actually gives you a very stern look and pulls his blade an inch from  the side of his scabbard  travis i wouldnt do that  matt at which point you can see 25 more clasp members step out even wounded ones as they are  all stepping up and gathering there are now 35 to 40 of them starting to form out of the shadows  forming a semicircle around 
none	 you entirely  sam dont do it grog  taliesin absolutely not  marisha lets go come on  travis a fellow cant smile every once in a while  laura well just back up  taliesin i take a bow and i turn my back to them and walk out  laura i do not turn my back i walk backwards the entire way out with an arrow notched  travis i stay next to vax  sam i say party on garthok and then we leave  laura keyleth darling could you maybe make a wall of stone 
none	 and close off this tunnel  marisha unfortunately no  liam save a thought for the people of emon if youve any room left in your narrow minds  and i back out  marisha i end with hopefully you will realize there is a far greater enemy at hand than the  personal squabbles between us small people and i also step away  matt the spirelings not even in view at this point hes disappeared amongst the rest of them  marisha im sure he can hear me  matt possibly as you guys exit and find your 
none	 way back up to the surface as the last of you makes  it outside of the entranceway you immediately start hearing this slamming and breaking of stone  from underneath you and you gather pretty rapidly that this entrance is being entirely removed for  possible entry  taliesin i would like to point out since you had such noble intentions towards my position on  things this is your ego at work here i may be many things and i may be a dealmaker but i  never forget that when i rule i rule these people as 
none	 well im not better than them and you  may think youre better than them but this is what it creates it creates enemies  marisha no percy the difference is i dont think im better than them  taliesin they certainly think you do and they are not pleased  laura this mark is it magic can they trace you through this mark  liam i dont answer i walk over to keyleth can you still do the thing with your hands  marisha fire noise that thing  liam i rip my shirt down i want you to 
none	 burn it away now  marisha vex do you have an arrow  laura of course  marisha i hand it to him put this in between your teeth sizzling noise  matt sizzling noise searing white pain through the back of your eyes vax as keyleth presses her  palm into the center of your shoulder blades you can hear the sizzling and cracking of skin and  smell the burning of vaxs flesh in the air in this cellar make a constitution check  liam seven  matt seven you break through the arrow with your grip and 
none	 actually give out a very loud painful  scream out of reaction  liam like you do  laura similar to when you hit me in my arm  matt kind of a moment passes keyleth you pull your hand back and where the clasp symbol once  was there is a hand mark burned into the back of the shoulders  travis vecna  laughter  liam it was you  travis kill her now  matt what would you guys like to do  sam well that was a bust  taliesin that could have gone so much 
none	 better  travis vax i think you made the right call and i dont think very often  sam or very well  travis yeah  liam thank you grog  taliesin i think we could have gotten out of there with at least the hintings of an alliance  as opposed to just  laura straight up  taliesin bitter enemies this was a disaster  travis sometimes you have to walk away from a bad deal to find a good one  sam thats not a thing  taliesin thats not a thing where did you didnt read 
none	 that  marisha i got what you were saying grog  travis when it rains the sun is shining  laura thats deep grog i like it  travis stew on that  laura i cast cure wounds on  liam no  laura i already did it too late i fucking touched you fucker  liam does that take the scar  laura it just takes the pain away  matt cure wounds what it does is prevents infection it does heal you for the hit points you  would have lost for that ill say it nullifies the 
none	 damage you would have taken from the burn  mark it does not alleviate you from the scarring its not as graphic as it would have been had it  been left to heal on its own but it does muddle the clasp symbol somewhat  liam okay thank you  sam shall we go back to our keep  travis we could just kill them all now  liam theres hundreds of them grog  taliesin splutters no we cant  travis i saw like 40 or 50  liam yeah there were another 160 in the rafters  
none	 taliesin it would do no good who would be bringing food into the city in the first place  liam theyre going to go on doing the same thing they would have done with us or without us  taliesin theyre doing it without us though  marisha but percy do you honestly think that after all of this was done do you want to be  beholden to those people  liam and i dont believe they are going to bend the knee to thordak i dont believe it  taliesin theyre not going to no of course not 
none	  liam and that was all i personally was worried about  taliesin i wanted people on the inside keeping us informed and we just lost a  very powerful spy network  liam i think the only people on the inside right now have scales  taliesin everybody needs something  laura can we go back to the keep  taliesin we are not going to bother were going to go and were going to find a way of killing  these things and were going to hope for the best in this city thats what were going to 
none	 do  matt as you guys are heading back i need stealth checks from everybody  laura stealth check pass without a trace  marisha fuck natural one  taliesin oh my god really  marisha natural one  laura then whats the point of anybody rolling  liam 27  sam 19  laura 37  travis 29  taliesin we have a plus ten 33  matt all right you guys push southward through the city finding your way at this point the sun  has set night has come in and occasionally you hear the flapping of 
none	 leathery wings overhead as a  number of sentry groups of wyvern riders go tearing through the city at one point you hear a  similar raspy cry sound and you hear other ones begin rising up off the rooftops heading in your  direction keyleth what do you guys do  taliesin the minute we see that im going to push her against the wall and im going to minor  illusion a shadow right over her  matt okay make a new stealth check with disadvantage  laura add ten  matt chuckles its a natural one on 
none	 their end  marisha oh good  matt as long as you didnt roll a natural one  marisha no i didnt i rolled an eight plus a seven plus ten  matt so at that point they whoosh one swoops down and lands on the edge of the roof and you  see it curling down and takes off again and they continue on out of the way you wait a few  moments before silence takes the night once more and you press on heading southward  laughter  laura nice  sam good job percy  marisha 
none	 thank you percy  taliesin one day youre going to stop being afraid of me by the way and i hope that day  comes soon  sam before we go to the keep do you want to swing by the place  taliesin the place  sam the place with the airships  taliesin theres no swinging by thats a caper thats an entire thing  that if were going to do  sam just to go there and look  travis the showroom is fucked its broken  taliesin this is one of those things that were going 
none	 to have to get everybody on board before we  even start talking about it so probably a good nights sleep  sam all right  laura we need to sleep we need to get up in the morning  taliesin and then well talk about an airship im really on board with the airship  sam all right  laura i think we need to go to vasselheim or whitestone  travis vasselheim  liam we dont need an airship to do that  laura no we dont but we also need to find out whats happening with allura 
none	 in whiterun  westruun all those cities  sam all right back to the keep then i guess when we get there can we check in on gilmore and  the queen  matt yes and as you return to the keep pike has been taking care of the rest of the individuals  and shes been seeing to gilmores side gilmore is fast asleep dealing with the tail end of a  fever that has broken after the healing from the day before earlier in the day i should say it  also appears that salda and the children 
none	 have been in and out keeping an eye as well pike as you  enter looks up to you with a smile and says hell be all right hes going to pull through  laura thats wonderful  matt i should probably stay with him for a bit make sure hes okay  liam is he unconscious still or just sleeping  matt he is asleep currently yeah hes been conscious throughout the day while you were gone  but hes got to rest a bit more hes still had a rough few days  travis its dead on  
none	 taliesin just needs headphones  matt i just need headphones and to brush against the mic occasionally especially during really  really impactful story moments  liam what what  matt so you guys find yourselves resting for the evening you take to a nights sleep  laura you going to sleep grog  travis yeah  matt yeah you got to sleep  travis i got to sleep  matt if you dont sleep youre going to start getting levels of exhaustion for the next day  travis oh okay  matt all right so you lose the strength

none	 so chipper  taliesin lets gather what we need make sure that gilmore is ready to move as well well  bring everybody through to whitestone  sam all right  matt all right  laura i guess we should go tell the guards that they probably will have to leave if they want  taliesin and that they can come work in whitestone  laura well i dont want to force them to but of course theyre welcome to  liam why dont you go ask the guards ill go talk to the kitchen staff  laura all right 
none	  travis i know who shes going to talk to  laura hes the captain of the guards anyway  matt well say for the sake of brevity you speak with the rest of the keeps staff including the  guards as well jarett for the most part is like as long as im still getting paid were more  than happy to go where you need us to be if its further away from dragons i am okay with that  sam dont you need your tools  taliesin i can pack up my kit and ive also technically 
none	 got a reasonable workshop back in  whitestone  matt okay so you gather your materials you prepare at the tree in the center of the keep you  say your goodbyes  sam before we go out there i go to my room i take a dump on my bed  matt youve used it at the temple of sarenrae  sam no its not a potion just a straightup poo  matt just a straightup poo okay marking your territory i respect that  sam i hang a note on the gate of the keep  travis shitting

none	 its nothing  marisha i can put hallucinatory terrain over it thatll last a bit but not  long enough to make it worthwhile  laura its just stone  liam weve done it once before we can do it again  taliesin it will be built back better than before thats what we do  laura lets go  matt the portal opens outside of the tree and all of the refugees start rushing through you  guys give chase following over to the opposite side where whitestone waits you all emerge from  the sun tree in the 
town	 center of the familiar town  liam fucking cold  matt it is chilly not as snowdappled as it was when you first arrived a little has melted and  the clouds are a little bit more open you can see some of the blue sky above you its actually a  beautiful day if a bit chilly as you emerge you can see theres a few individuals in the center of  the town including a couple of the original refugees that seem to be waiting for the rest to  come through they greet you as soon as 
none	 you arrive and rush up and grab a couple of people  that they had met at your keep some come forward and say thank you im so glad you made it  they shake your hands  youve arrived back in whitestone so do you guys want to wait here for the day and then make your  way to vasselheim  sam do we need to talk to anybody here  taliesin just to set up to make sure that the queen and her children  are taken in at the castle  liam i imagine youll fill

none	 of income or gold which theyd kept was put in with the rest of the whitestone treasury when they  took over  liam not so much interested in gold as in means of protection or healing  matt they werent really specialized in healing im afraid and what bits of protection they had  youve already taken but if gold is what you need we can probably spare you some  laura i mean im not going to say no to the gold  taliesin obviously well sieve the coffer a little bit because were going to  need 
none	 it for the mission  laura so very generous of you  taliesin also lets reemploy our castle guards as the emon royal guards in the meantime and they  can serve the queen and her children  laura i like it  matt that can be very easily presented oh here we are theres a small chest with a lid that she  hands it over to you actually puts it out and your hands are already out all right 2000 gold  from our coffers its not much but we have to keep the city running  laura

none	 seen a number of trees the largest youve seen in vasselheim would  probably have been on the outskirts of  liam where we fought the hydra maybe  marisha we camped out in a few trees outside of vasselheim  matt do you want to stop outside the city or within the city is the question  marisha whatevers closest  travis no no magic in the city  laura no magic in the city remember  matt no arcane magic divine magic is a different thing theres plenty of  divine magic within the city  laura oh 
none	 is there a teleportation circle do we have one in whitestone  marisha there wasnt a teleportation circle to vasselheim  matt there are no sigils to vasselheim part of their defense process is preventing any secret  intrusion in that regard  taliesin well teleport to the outside of the city and perhaps sleep at the temple of sarenrae  matt theres the abundant terrace  laura we always have rooms at slayers take remember  taliesin we do always have rooms at slayers take  marisha whats the abundant terrace  matt thats the section that melora looks 
none	 over that is where primarily most of the farming food  marisha yeah lets go there  matt thats where you know there are a number of orchards and things that are kept in that  vicinity if you wanted to  marisha thats right outside the city  matt its within the city its one of the five quarters i wont say quarters its one of the  five areas  marisha sure  matt quarters  laura is gilmore staying here in whitestone yes  matt yeah unless you want to try and bring him with you

none	 you emerge out the  other side you are in the thick of a heavy orchard in the abundant terrace there is heavy  snowfall that has fallen recently here and where it was cold in whitestone its cold here in  vasselheim you can see builtup ice and sleet that has recently been pushed off to the sides of  the orchard even amongst this very cold weather all of the plant life in this area is vibrant and  springtime green  as you all emerge in the center of this orchard you can see one of the 
none	 nearby workers whos  tilling the land looks over hey what are you doing here youre not supposed to be in the  middle of the orchard  laura slayers take business well keep moving  taliesin we were just leaving  matt groans fucking slayers take do whatever the fuck they want he drinks out of his canteen  fine just get out  liam glad that manticores not in your orchard thats all i can say  matt manticore  taliesin thats just cruel  laura dont worry we took care of it  matt weakly thanks he 
town	 starts looking nervously over his shoulders as he goes back to  his work eventually you guys step outside of the terrace finding your way to the quadroads which  is the central network that the four main portions of vasselheim attach to this is the erathisbased  center of the town you have before you to remind you at the very northern part of the town is the  extremely tall pointed mountain known as heavens stair attached to that mountain on one side is  the silver talons reach that is the main temple to bahamut to the 
none	 left of it against the  mountain not actually into it is the braving grounds this is the area that is geared towards  kord the deity of war where you had previously had a conversation with the dawn master the  earthbreaker groon theres the platinum sanctuary in the silver talons reach which is where the  highbearer vord the silvertouched the high priest of bahamut is you also just left the  abundant terrace and there is the quadroads which is where the slayers take currently is and  there is the duskmeadow which is the raven queens 
none	 domain where do you guys want to go  liam remind me what was the duskmeadow again was that where we chased the rakshasa  matt that is where the amaranthine oubliette resides which is the prison of the city  marisha what was the name of the section of the city that has the slayers take  matt thats the quadroads the erathis deity of civilization  travis so like i really want to go talk to the kung fu panda master i dont think were going to  get a lot of fights in the guy i think 
none	 he was the teacher of kern  the guy i beat in the crucible  liam that ripped chiseled old man  travis yeah  sam the guy who beat you twice  liam laura and travis no  travis and nobody beat me twice he got lucky once get it straight i want to go talk to him  because maybe we need some more fighters and strong folks and i think he might know where they  might be  sam we should talk to the slayers take as well  taliesin we should get our rooms

dung	 of the main slayers take guildhall the dark wood  exterior greets you happily you can see they still have a gathering of various antlers of  creatures that are tangled into each other that form this rusticlooking entrance and there on  the front doors you see emblazoned the slayers take for lack of a better term their symbol  with the words of their actual guild spread across it as you saw before  opening the front door you can see within the main foyer area there is the dark iron  chandeliers that run across the entire 
none	 length of the moot hall if you will across the front area  you find the clerk desk sitting behind it a familiar redhaired tousled chinbearded  scarredup tiny man with his feet up on the desk falling asleep in his chair  laura laughs oi  liam tada  matt what is this craziness laughs ah its been some time  laura it has  matt so hello  laura hi  matt whats your business what are you looking for  laura dragons have you heard about anything  matt other than the fact that you killed one

none	 two individuals  in there you see a very scarred burly and frustrated dwarf whos throwing down cards on a  table black long series of beards and his hair over his beard you see thorbir is sitting there  at the card table with another man wearing really beautiful ornate armor that is wellpolished  very short dirty blond hair who is apparently owning him at cards going chuckles youve  terrible luck friend im sorry to hear this  laura whispering aldor  matt its aldor  taliesin whoa  matt thorbirs sitting there and throws his cards 
none	 on the table scoffs sighs they tell me  im supposed to have the luck of the dwarves  laughter  matt oh i guess its about time you all showed up im going to get a drink and he gets up  away from the table and walks away from the rest of you with a halfhearted hi but hes in a  huffy mood and walks off aldor takes his winnings and scoops the change into a pouch  liam aldor aldor aldor  sam hows lyra have you seen her  laughter  matt why have you
