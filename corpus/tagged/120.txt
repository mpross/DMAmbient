none	 final one remaining they  pushed the timeline for their encounter with the chroma conclave forward at a rapid pace and in  the process of getting ready for this final encounter with thordak the cinder king the  great swollen powerful ancient red dragon who lords over emon and taldorei you took a trip to  the fire elemental plane to retrieve the final vestige known as the plate of the dawnmartyr for  your fantastic gnome cleric pike  upon making your way there to the city of brass a very tyrannical society and a large ancient city 
none	  run by efreet you encountered some interesting characters in senokir and uten a fire genasi and  a tiefling two partnered jewelers that brought you into their establishment decided to help you  out threw you in chains to give the image of you being slaves to his business brought you guys to  speak to a number of the currently free fire giants in the city as apparently the armor belonged or was  won by a fire giant  you managed to upon asking one named whaska got the information and sent you to juuraiel a gambler 
none	  and very welloff fire giant one of the few responsible for selling the rest of their  people into slavery here within the city of brass in which a card game was not won  sam it was this close  matt this close every single time  sam yeah  matt that was kind of absurd however you were given the option as opposed to now having sold  yourselves into slavery to the giant to instead do this grand favor for them apparently the  past lover of this giant was killed in the streets by a 
none	 pit fiend named ghurrix who occasionally  wanders the slave district called the arches here in the city of brass you agreed to go find and  kill this pit fiend out of vengeance for the giant and as such you would be freed from your current  onus and be given the armor that is in the possession of juuraiel this giant as well so  everything should be great you guys applied a seeming enchantment across the party allowing  most of you to look kind of like copies of vex and vax the sexy sextuplets as you 
none	 put it the kind  of things youd want to purchase made your way to the slave market called the arches with scanlan  shorthalt disguised as a flamewreathed azer a fire plane dwarf you proceeded to try and sell  this party to the pit fiend ghurrix as he walked through the area after acquiring and purchasing  two celestialblooded boys who were on another slavery block  liam altar boys  matt thats disgusting bait and it was bait and its worked out well so far as it got the  attention of the pit fiend the pit 
town	 fiend wandered to where you had set the entrance to your  mansion scanlan upon some conversation seemingly were unable to convince the pit fiend to  suddenly step into this unsafe spectral doorway that you had attempted to coax him into as many  of you emerged into the street with pike and percy hiding within the mansion the rest of you  set the stage here at the mouth of this alleyway the nearby bubbling of a lava stream just off to  the right side of you keyleth hidden in the back of the alleyway decided that 
none	 while this moment  was still tense to use the element of surprise and attempted to feeblemind the pit fiend  unfortunately it was resisted by the creature who then as an instinctive reaction summoned a  friend known as an erinyes from the nine hells to join ghurrix at his side and that is where we  left off were going to bring up some boss music here  liam props to that set though  laura this set is amazing  matt seeing as how were in the fire elemental plane i think its important that we have 
none	 some  proper fire elemental plane lighting  liam ghurrix would you like to phone a friend  matt would you like to phone a friend thats not going to help  marisha so the blue thing is the magical door  matt to give you guys some context setwise this is the doorway the entrance to scanlans  mansion big as the doorway you could have made back here is keyleth who had fired off the spell  here we have vex and trinket who you had popped out as well as vax who had just stepped out of 
none	  the portal scanlan with in front of you the two boys  laura in front of him they were in front of him  sam we were sending them off to be sold  laura yeah but i thought you were holding out the chain and they were standing behind you  sam no i was holding the chain and they stepped forward  matt and grog was off here to the side here we have ghurrix himself as well as his ally companion  and a number of other slavers andor slaves that currently line the streets as 
dung	 part of this who  are now watching as this conflict may seem to erupt here  sam narrator slash dungeon master what are those guards theres guards in the city  laura i looked for them the last game and theyre not around right now  matt there are efreet you didnt see any around at the moment no and they are called the  illuminated  travis does his companion have a name  matt you dont know you can certainly ask  liam and whats behind the pit fiend where the map disappears is there building there 
none	 or what  matt there is an edge to a building there and part of a thoroughfare walkway  liam how many stories is the building behind them  matt id say probably two stories  sam is that building made of sharp spikes that if we destroyed the building it would kill the bad guy  matt probably not however i would like to ask you all to roll initiative  sam a lot going on this roll  marisha oh natural 20 i dont know what to do with that in this situation  matt all righty so 
none	 looking at how things stand here currently 25 to 20  marisha 22  laura 24  matt 24 okay  laura i rolled for pike too is that right  matt yeah whats pikes roll  laura shes going to kill me  matt natural one so pike is at the bottom rolling in character for her thats great great  20 to 15  liam 19  travis also 19 yeah baby  laura but you know what thatll give her more time to get into the game  matt hold on so grog and vax 19 percy 
none	  taliesin 18  matt 18  taliesin its not good for me  matt all right scanlan what did you get  sam 13  matt 13  sam ill be dead by the time i go  matt perfect given that standpoint we are at the top of the combat round you watch as the pit  fiends wings unfurl the jaw clenches as the fangs now protruding from underneath its demonic  visage it looks past all of you into the alleyway the source of the magic that seemed to  affect it now its current intent 
none	 the other the devilish female that stepped through the brief  portal her wings unfurled floating gently off the ground holding the longsword in one hand a  longbow strewn over her shoulder and some sort of strange wound rope or lasso on her belt side  fully armored now looking intently as to what her next target is going to be vex you are at the top  laura im the top  matt youre the top 24  laura oh jesus oh my god okay  marisha what are we doing  laura number one im going to

none	 have to roll to hit but then when it hits it does the damage and then  the strength save is to see if its restrained or not  laura okay so im going to tell trinket to move up next to him  matt okay trinket rushes through trinket comes charging upward roars  laura yeah and can i do bramble shot as one of my attacks and then do another regular attack is  that the way it works  matt whats it say for the specific ability  laura it just says bramble shot  matt so 
none	 yeah one of your attacks would be a bramble shot  laura okay im going to try to do the bramble shot on it  matt all right go for it  laura okay that doesnt work  matt what did you roll  laura a one  matt a natural one again  laura two ones  travis wheres your dice jail  laura i dont know the dice jail was in the thing its not here  matt bramble shot goes wide swooping past it and slamming into the building behind it you watch as  the arrow 
none	 explodes and a series of vines tangle outward and wrap around the side of the building  laura cool this is off to a really awesome start  travis come on captain lets go  laura im going to just try to shoot him  matt all right  laura 25  matt all righty  laura does that hit him  matt 25 hits yeah  laura okay good 14 16 17 18 plus 2d6 because trinkets standing next to him 25  matt 25 damage all right you already used your bonus action to hunters mark so he

none	 for the pit fiend whats the dc  marisha 19  matt 19 so it succeeds  travis that was strength too  matt the erinyes makes an eight she does not succeed while the sphere seems to splatter and  try and encompass the pit fiend it is unaffected by the torrent of water however the winged  erinyes whos floating in the air seems to be pulled into it and is now thrashing about within  the water itself  laura good job  marisha can i now move it now  matt you conjure the sphere  
none	 marisha it says as an action i can move the sphere up to 30 feet  matt from what i can see right here no you create the sphere and they are restrained and  then future turns as an action you can move it  marisha okay  sam nice  marisha its restrained  sam you got some bonus shit to do  marisha not right now im going to wait  travis you got some bonus shit to do  sam yo you got some bonus shit  matt you know some bonus shit  marisha on

none	 him if i could  matt yes we can totally do that  travis i can grapple a creature one size larger than myself  matt that you can  marisha get these fuckers locked down  liam dnd bob ross reference is like playstation trophies  matt its how its supposed to be man just saying your grapple can replace an attack as we  said before so go ahead and make a strength athletics check  travis and i have advantage on these because im raging  matt correct  travis 15 nine 23  matt 22 moving 
none	 up you have him currently grappled  travis and laura great  sam okay  marisha theyre both grappled  sam lets all leave except for grog  travis that replaces an attack  matt you currently have him grappled with your arm right now  sam well tell your story grog  travis can i revisit the days of the crucible and can i try and suplex this motherfucker onto his side  matt you know what sure why not  travis i want to just to get him prone also  matt yeah because currently id say for 
none	 the purposes of the grapple because it takes you all  of your strength to do so you would not be able to attack with your axe while you have him grappled  that wouldnt function you have him grappled go ahead and make another athletics check  travis okay  liam get it girl get it  travis 19  matt he rolled a 17 plus eight so that is a 25 so no as you attempt to lift these giant devil  claws jam into the side of your shoulders and as the pain hits it forces you 
none	 down and you cant  get enough lift his wings are just too big hes too dense  travis but im still giving him love right  matt youre still holding onto him all righty  travis that ends my turn  matt all right that ends grogs turn  liam okay im standing right in front of scanlan right  matt yes you are well youre right next to him  liam right next to him all right im going to take my hand and palm him by the face and cast  heroism on him thats the first

none	 about 40 feet in the air directly behind him  matt back that way well say for the purposes of this youre back behind him  liam all right  matt okay so how far up did you fly  liam im going to do 50 feet above his head back a little bit and right into his head that  diagonal line is probably just the edge of 60 and since grog is hugging him its sneak attack and  hes grappled which means i have advantage so it is 25 which should hit if i was paying attention 
none	  to the acs two well say is ten plus the sneak attack damage is 15 18 22 25 28 31 35 plus  the psychic damage 35 plus i need an eight somebody give me an eight wheres an eight 38  matt 38 gotcha all right that ends your turn  liam no then im going to fly an additional because im hasted i can go 120 feet im going  to go up another 40 feet no im going to stay where i am stay where i am  sam am i heroic now what does that

none	 would even for a nice solid bite it seems to be resistant to trinkets damage  laura to piercing damage to bear damage  matt half damage from bears  travis was he resistant to my slashing damage  matt no  laura what it must be piercing  travis i do have a magic weapon  matt that ends ghurrixs turn all right that brings us now to the erinyes the erinyes is going  to attempt to escape  marihsa strength saving throw bitch  matt thats a 17 plus four thats 21 breaks free of the sphere 
none	 erinyes which can go 60 feet  up is going to fly up onto the rooftop there your sphere is left there on the ground however  wasted the action to try and break through all right that ends their turns the two celestial boys try  and pull against the chains do you let go or do you hold them there  sam i let go  matt okay they both run this way  laura no i meant in the mansion  matt do you yell this as they  start to run way  laura i said

none	 get temporary hit points  liam at the start of my next turn i do though dont i  matt did you cast it on yourself or on scanlan  liam both of us action action and the bonus action was an attack hasted  matt you cant have two concentration spells up at the same time  liam oh its a concentration spell  matt yes it is  liam ill leave it on scanlan can i take a secondary hit on him after the fact since i was  unaware of the rules  matt sure because youre 
none	 not used to casting spells sure ill let you  marisha technically i thought you couldnt cast i thought it doesnt work with spells i  dont know  sam and matt what  marisha thought you couldnt just cast two spells it was only melee attacks  liam right which is what hes saying  matt one of them is concentration because its an action spell one action from your haste spell  can only be used for a weapon attack  liam right and we had a text conversation earlier today where i said that if i dont 
none	 hold an  action i can do this this and this and we just misunderstood each other  matt probably thats totally fine sorry i misunderstood earlier and thought you were  just casting it on scanlan no worries  liam so keep the one on scanlan and im going to roll i would have rolled a secondary shitty  attack on him for 22  matt okay that hits  liam okay that is a massive nine hit points of damage  matt boom all righty great so now it is pikes turn  sam i havent gone yet 
none	  matt oh thats right  sam okay i am too far away to do anything and dont really want to get in closer i will get a  little bit closer so i am in range to inspire keyleth  marisha aw thanks man  sam and i will inspire her with a randomly selected limerick from this disgusting book that  taliesin gave me  taliesin oh throw it at me okay  sam okay  taliesin pick carefully  sam theyre all horrible  taliesin they are pick carefully  sam okay ready nope thats disgusting wow

none	 an interposing hand between keyleth and the pit fiend  marisha thanks scanlan  matt all righty  sam so now hell just attack me instead  matt interposing hand you have half cover keyleth as bigbys hand is essentially giving you  some sort of armor bonus  sam does it stop him from moving towards her is that how it happens  matt it gives her half cover  sam its like a wall  matt target cant move through the hands space if its strength score is less than or equal to the  hands strength score 
none	  sam oh shit its probably super strong  matt the hands strength score is 26 it is equal  sam so what does that mean its a roll  matt so it can move through the hand  sam shit well that didnt do much  matt hold on oh its less or equal to so no it cannot move through the hand sorry i misread it  currently if it tries to force its way through  the hand its going to hold it in place  marisha talk to the hand  sam yes  matt there 
none	 we go all right so that finishes your turn all right now its pikes turn  laura oh okay im controlling pike right now  matt yes you are for the time being pike is inside the mansion right now she watched  percy step into the door frame fire a few shots out and then duck right behind it again  laura okay so shes looking through the door what can she see  matt right now all she sees is grog and trinket were attacking the pit fiend as it flew off and  thats all she sees

none	 fashion all right so for the purposes of that we will say that this  glowing yellow  laura its a yellow noose so it looks spiritual  matt all righty so well say that its in the same space as him where you conjure it there at  a fourth level so at fourth level that means its attacks do 4d8 plus five per hit if it hits now  that its landed so you cast a spell it makes a melee attack so go ahead and roll a d20 adding  ten to that  laura 23  
none	 matt that hits so go ahead and roll 4d8 plus five  laura 26 points and is that all the bonus  matt thats all the bonus action  laura okay cool  matt she cannot cast any other spell unless its second level or lower  laura oh okay is beacon of hope oh its third level shit balls  sam can you please do this as ashley please  laura oh okay oh hold on  taliesin thats actually really good  matt things that are helpful aid lets see there is prayer of healing  laura okay

none	 side of the building  travis could i use my movement to crossfit my way up  matt as you climb over the side you do manage to get right over impacts right there you see the  erinyes is ducked down with the longbow drawn with an arrow looks up and sees your much larger  now face grinning over the side as you grin back and then impact land on the opposite  travis panting hold on i need a breather naw im just fucking about youre dead can i go into  a frenzied no that was 
none	 my bonus action so i get two can i do reckless great weapon  master two attacks on shera  matt yes you may  travis 21  matt 21 does hit however shes going to use her reaction to parry so as you begin to do  that she releases the tension on the arrow pulls her longsword out and parries the blade to the  side it adds four to her ac and you miss by one the axe slides off and slams into the stonework  next to her as she begins to step away from you 
none	  travis whoa do i know if she can do that again  matt you dont know  travis right kittens got claws ill make the second one reckless but not great weapon master  i already said it was should i do it again because i said it all right fine  laura she probably cant do it again  travis 31 minus five 26  matt that hits go ahead and roll damage  travis hey she didnt do it again yahtzee one point of necrotic 26 plus ten is 36  matt 36 oof all righty that

none	 god damn it okay thatll do 19  matt okay as you come charging through the doorway you guys watch as percys form disappears  into the space which is immediately followed by a heavy slamming sound as the pit fiend like a  keyteor drops right there on the ground right next to pike and scanlan it shouts over its  shoulder call your men as it emanates from its psychic wave of telekinetic speech call your  men i need aid going to unload on the beacon of divinity that stands before it that has healed  sam 
none	 unless it is trapped in my sphere  matt so as it moves into the space whats the save on that again  sam 21 if im using my cone which was up for my last one i did not cutting words on this one so  hes got advantage  matt that is a 22 plus eight to his dex saving throw there he has resistance he slams onto the  ground  ashley im going to wave at him  matt as you wave at him pike he makes his claw attack against you that is a 19 
none	 plus thats a 34  to hit  liam does that hit ashley  ashley no it doesnt hit  laughter  matt so that is 20 points of slashing damage ashley its going to attempt to bite you its a  natural 20 on the bite thats not good at all that is 40 points of piercing damage ashley and  i need you to make a constitution saving throw  liam matthew mercer keeping us humble since 2013  laura hes really enjoying himself tpk tonight guys  ashley oh boy thats bad i got an eight  
none	 matt all right so you also suffer as the poison courses through your body that is 25 points of  piercing damage im not going to double that because technically its not the attack its the  poison that hurt you the poison isnt critical thats a gift  liam its pronounced jift  matt now its going to swing with its tail action that is a 20 to hit  sam im going to cutting words that with my reaction  ashley my armor class is 20 unless there were no aids with that  matt well hold on 
dung	 youre going to cutting words  sam thats a hit so im going to cutting words that im going to sing singing your evilness  is killing me and i must confess i want to flee but when you see me you lose your mind baby its  a sign pit fiend baby now youre mine  liam that was strong  matt roll that d12 man you earned that shit  sam three  matt thats enough so the tail sweeps over to try and smash pike as you start singing the  tail halfway through stops and it 
none	 looks at you then continues the swing but thats just enough  for pike to dodge out of the way as it cracks into the stonework however it then backswings  with its mace toward you with its final attack pike that is a 22 to hit so you suffer 15 points  of bludgeoning damage plus  ashley im unconscious im unconscious  matt youre unconscious well that would have been an additional 24 points of fire damage so  pike is poisoned and unconscious scanlan you feel the blade at your side begin to vibrate at  the 
none	 end of your song the mythcarver thats been sitting there it begins to shake and quiver at  your side the erinyes is against you now its its turn throws the bow to the side on the  ground pulls its longsword out and is going to go three attacks against you having jammed your  blade into its side  liam yes uncanny dodge  matt first one is going to be a 19  liam does not hit  matt that is a 13 last hit is a 24  liam i will use a second luck to 
none	 make her roll again  matt that is even better that is a 25  liam all right uncanny dodge  matt so you take the hit for the longsword that is five plus four its nine points of  slashing damage actually sorry that would be plus more nine points of slashing damage plus  you take 20 points of poison damage  liam so the poisons full but the swipe is halved  matt technically its all in one strike so the whole attack would be halved  liam so it was nine plus what 20  matt 
none	 nine plus 20 you take 14 points of damage there you go all right scanlan its your turn  sam fuck im going to draw mythcarver and look at it admire it for a moment turn to pike whos  right next to me and healing words her with just a simple touch can i demonstrate on you  taliesin im going to do this just that  taliesin it was actually rather pleasant i have to admit it you have very soft hands  sam theyve never worked a day in their life ten points of healing to pikey

dung	 action to have trinket  attack so go ahead and roll the attack with trinket you rush forward and put your hands onto  pike desperately trying to heal her as the energy pulses through her body no effect all you  see is the wound from the bite of the fiend in her neck and you see the dark veins curling up now  you know at that proximity that its poison  laura i couldnt have run up and looked at her to know it was poison to see the black around her  fucking cool 27 for

none	 matt begins hacking at vax right next to you you rush around your hands glow this beam of sun  energy bursts out you hear the screaming echo as her body is turned to ash within her armor  causing the armor to clank to the ground the rope at her side scattering to the ground as well she  has been destroyed  marisha something its a hollow victory  laura good job good job  marisha do i still have any more movement  matt you do youve moved five feet so you still have  marisha 85

none	 kind of hard to flank without stepping into the mansion unfortunately because the door is  right there on the flank  marisha i can fly though i can hover can i hover and flank  matt not really you have to be on the entire opposite side from somebody else so theres no  real place you can flank here unfortunately  sam its all good youre going to die anyway it doesnt matter right were all going to die  marisha ill just hover there and look imposing ill puff up real big  matt good to know 
none	 so you are puffing up real big well say above all right cool grog  travis right not that i dont love being in this river of liquid magma could i get out please  matt well first you take 74 points of fire damage from being in the lava at the start of your turn  travis can i use stones endurance  matt you can  travis 26 so whats  matt itd be 48 you take 48 points of fire damage  travis thank you for doing the math for me  matt the pain is unbearable 
none	 but you use that to fuel your anger as you climb out feeling the  molten rock spilling off of your body i imagine youre going to want to move out of it  travis yeah yeah toward everybody else where all the danger is the fun zone now i have a  question  matt you want to flank around this way or this way  travis around this way  matt okay so you pull around to that side  travis what i would like to try and do is as i get out of the magma seeing 
none	 pike unconscious is  the worst if i try and grab her and head for the door i have to go past the pit fiend hell get  an attack of opportunity on me if im cradling her does he get one on her as well  matt generally attack of opportunity is against the creature thats running so itd probably be  against you  travis all right i would like to pick up my buddy pike and make like hell for the door  matt okay so you reach down you grab her using your full action pick 
none	 her currently unconscious  limp form in your arm cradling her you see the wound the blood across her you pick her up and  you go running around into the door as you do the pit fiend he already took his attack of  opportunity earlier so yeah he does not get one so you grab pike and move and disappear into the  doorway with her  travis all right oh pike  matt all righty that ends your turn grog vax youre up  liam okay im going to rocket toward the hm just give me ten 
none	 seconds to think  sam loot crate loot crate  matt be ready percy  liam okay im going to rocket into the door so ive got haste ive got 120 feet  matt okay  liam so im going to arc into the door if i pass the pit demon im going to use disengage as a  bonus action so he does not and ill swivel underneath  laura hes already used his attack of opportunity  liam he has oh and vex is right next to him five feet im going to stab him in the fucking 
none	  face as i fly in the door 24 hits  matt 24 hits yep  liam okay so that is adding 41 as i fly past into the door use lay on hands twice theres  nothing in the book that says i can only use it once a turn so im going to use the first time i  use it to cast neutralize poison on her and the second time im going to use it to give her one  hit point it doesnt say anything in the book about amount per turn  matt as an 
none	 action you touch a creature  liam but i have two more actions  matt you used one to attack  liam can i use the bonus action to attack  matt you could use your haste attack to hit him on the way through and that can only be used as  an attack anyway because thats the nature of the haste bonus you can use your action to neutralize  the poison  liam all right question for matt and im liam right now if i bring her up ten hit points  right poison doesnt bring her 
none	 down anymore in 5e it just puts her to disadvantage correct  matt this poison youre not quite sure you dont know the circumstance  liam im going to use five points of lay on hands to cure the poison  matt okay so the poison is removed from her that is as much as you can do  liam well if i can only use lay on hands once im going to throw another dagger out the door  into the pit fiend  matt you cannot see him from that side of the door the doorway is facing 
none	 outward hes on the  other side of the doorway that is the end of your turn pike is no longer poisoned the bulging  black veins retract from her throat the shallow breath is still there though fading percy  taliesin ive lost my list of healing potions but i think i had a minor potion left  marisha are you inside  taliesin i am inside  travis i got lots of potions  taliesin im going to grab a potion from i was about to say i know i have one but everything  got fucked we

dung	 tuning fork its vibrating at the tip and the sword is wanting to guide you its your call  marisha i feel like this is a very strong hint from the dungeon master  sam im not picking up any signs from him  travis i think you should just put it away maybe offer him the mythcarver to leave us alone  matt what do you want to do scanlan your choice entirely  sam im going to bonus action heal myself healing word level two okay two of these so  thats nine points  matt you get

none	 so im going to cast modify memory at sixth level  all oh  sam ten minutes have not gone by this whole things taken two minutes right  matt this whole things been roughly from beginning to end about two minutes yeah from a  spatial positioning standpoint okay it has to make a wisdom saving throw because technically  you are fighting the creature because grog made it hostile again it does get advantage on the saving throw  sam fuck  liam can i use my luck on him i have one left watching this  matt 
none	 i think it may be just an attack  liam i dont think so  matt thats why im going to check yo  liam im wrong about a lot of things matt ingame and out of game  matt im glad youre using it on enemy rolls now  sam theres nothing in that book that says he cant theres something in this book that says  something much worse  taliesin have you looked at the table of contents yet you should look at the table of contents  itll make you really happy  matt you can 
none	 also spend a luck point when an attack roll is made against you  liam just attack rolls all right  matt that wouldve been really powerful  sam abuses of the clergy  taliesin thats my favorite chapter  matt thats cocked that is 19 what is your spell dc again  sam 21  matt you watch its eyes glaze over for a minute and the flame flickers out in its hand as it drops  to the side what are you doing what are you modifying  sam im telling him you heard this fiend pledge to 
none	 murder the sultan its a sultan right you  heard this fiend pledge to murder the sultan and you joined with us defeated him you are brave  you are strong you should tell everyone this  matt so you paint out this whole memory this whole image of watching this pit fiend caught by  you guys and this illuminated efreet that this plot was uncovered the scuffle continued and you  make this entire epic battle where somehow youre the most powerful creature in the universe and  tore this thing asunder practically onehanded next to this efreet 
none	 you instill it with the joy  and the pride that it just foiled a plot against the sultan you watch as its limp self puffs up  with its hands on its hips as the spell finishes taking effect rewriting its memory it looks down  at you and goes you are brave small one  sam not as brave as you sir  matt your assistance will be remembered he puts his hand out to clasp yours it encompasses  your entire elbow with a beastmaster shake  sam noodle arm  matt as the rest of the 
none	 illuminated swoop in now to catch up weapons drawn the one that you were  talking to goes there is no need we have thwarted the plot the sultan is safe this slaver  here and his paltry allies they helped me stop it the rest of the illuminated go piss off  youre blowing stop blowing smoke well done the efreet that you cast on looks a little  deflated no but seriously points to the ashes there on the ground and goes to join the rest of  them theyre giving him shit you can tell theres a 
none	 rapport with them they dont fully  believe his story but there doesnt appear to be any intent against you through a brief  conversation with them they have no reason to consider you an enemy youve through a single  series of lucky rolls and a perfect use of modify memory prevented the probably 10000ish  illuminated that were in the city let me look at the specific  taliesin i just want to double check i still have my attack though so i can actually hit him and  sam yeah thats a great idea do that  
none	 matt more than that youre looking at 50000 illuminated that are in the city guard  sam 50000  taliesin im going to saunter over to the pile of ash and see if theres any proof that i can grab  that we took care of this  travis i would join him so i can grab the mallet the mace that the pit fiend had unless it turned  to ash as well  matt it did not turn to ashes however when you grab it it is a dull cold iron mace that is too  large for 
none	 you to use  travis too large for me  matt i mean you could use it but it would be disadvantage on attacks  marisha but he can carry it right proof youve got to trade it for the dawnmartyr armor is there  anything else left of him  matt no the rest of its just ash the rest of it burned away into ash  marisha didnt he have a symbol on his chest or whatever  matt there is the symbol that he had yeah you would find that which is his mark of his station 
town	  within the embassy  taliesin was he wearing a leather thong kind of thing with a flap because i feel like i could  really  matt nope  taliesin okay  matt look at the mini nope did you check for anything else while youre here as apparently  the rest of the crowd has begun to come back and fill in the arches again  liam lets amscray  travis what about the rope she had the lasso  taliesin go look to see if theres anything left  laura ill fly up there and see

none	  sam i can sing a song to heal you all by 1d12 is that right  matt on top of whatever you used your hit dice on you also heal 1d12  sam okay i will sing a song i will sing singing heal thee with a song heal thee all  night all night all night long heal thee  liam so 1d12 and then we do whatever after that  matt correct  ashley 1d12 plus what  matt well he rolls it so sam go ahead and roll that  sam its a 12  matt 
none	 everyone heals 12 hit points and then let me know how much you heal based on your hit dice  taliesin fully healed  matt all right percys fully healed  taliesin oh and short rest which means i get all that back and i get that back  sam hit dice huh okay lots of math going on  matt is anyone looking at the items you found  laura sure ill look at my stuff  matt okay boots or rope  travis i healed up to 168  matt 168 on grog all righty  liam im 
none	 up to full 99  matt vax is full  sam im up to 85  matt 85 on scanlan  marisha i am up to 80  laura im up to 100  matt awesome so boots or rope vex  laura the rope and im going to pass the boots to keyleth to look at  matt okay so im going to pass these over to you guys  travis oh god  laura ooh here you go i passed this to you so you could look at them this is the rope of  entanglement the rope 
none	 is 30 feet long and weighs three pounds if you hold one end of the rope and  use an action to speak its command word the other end darts forward to entangle a creature you see  within 20 feet of you the target must succeed a dc of 15 dexterity or become restrained  travis do you read that slow all the time  laura yes you can release a creature by a bonus action target restrained by the rope can use an  action im trying to scan it  matt so you essentially release the rope 
none	 as an action toward a creature within 20 feet and it  tries to wrap it and restrain it  travis theyd essentially be grappled  matt restrained grapple just means their movement is brought to zero restrained means their  movement is brought to zero attack rolls against them have advantage and attack rolls that they  make have disadvantage and they have disadvantage on dexterity saving throws  laura and its a bonus action  matt its an action  taliesin do ranged attacks also have advantage oh so you grab something and we start whaling on  
none	 it from a distance  matt well grapple is different from restrained with the rope yeah you can do that youre your  own moving gallows  travis it can be destroyed it has 20 hit points and an ac of 20 is it limited by the size of the  creature  matt yeah  travis i cant restrain a fire giant  matt probably not going to work on thordak just saying  marisha these boots appear to actually be boots that my people might have made they are boots of  spider climbing the wearer can spend 
none	 an action to cast spider climb on themselves no concentration  required the effect lasts for an hour spider climb lets you i go to percy hes waving dibs  taliesin yes no this is definitely for me  laura does anybody want this rope  travis hello  laura you want the rope of entanglement  ashley i healed to 74 btw  matt thank you pike  laura did i say what i healed to i did right  matt you did yeah so as you guys finish a short rest youve taken in the circumstance youve  
none	 narrowly avoided a very very bad situation with the city  marisha i thought that the guards were going to show up way sooner we lucked out theyve got a  low response time in this city  travis it wasnt bad it was only a couple minutes better than la  static  matt what do you guys want to do youre inside the mansion you still have the two slaves you  acquired  laura yeah oh we should talk to them theyre not in chains though did the servants get the  chains off of them  
none	 matt the servants did take the chains off of them theyre both hiding in the back of the foyer  as you guys are resting  travis go on vex see what they want  laura all right i wander over to them hello  matt hi  laura hi whats your name darling  matt they both seem a little more relaxed than when you first spoke with them im kyor hes hunin  laura kyor and hunin okay  matt thank you  laura of course  matt whatever you need  laura how long have you been

none	 the two we have no real care or love for her for what  shes done  laura understandable  matt whatever the fates bring us toward i suppose well walk that  laura well theyve brought you toward us darling  matt he still seems uncomfortable and very much like what are you going to do  laura were not slavers we dont want you as slaves if youd like to stay with us we can try  to keep you safe at least we can get you out of this fire plane if all things go well  
none	 matt looks over to hunin hunin looks and shakes his head this place is terrible if you know a  way out please take us with you  taliesin how do you feel about snow  matt i like snow where were from theres lots of snow  taliesin well that will do then  marisha theres a very nice city where we came from might be able to start a new life there  matt okay  laura how old are you  matt were both about you can see they have to think for a second you get 
none	 the sense that they  probably didnt have a very good education either where they came from  travis respect  matt about 15  laura 15  travis i think i might be that many  laura well you can come with us for a while all right  matt yes  laura all right did you eat some chicken have some chicken put some meat on your little bones  matt the other spectral servants come and take their hands lift up and lead them toward the  kitchen where they both excitedly seem to enjoy the prospect

dung	 you totally kissed your sister  travis nasty  matt and then right now planted one on a flaming darkskinned bearded fellow  liam yeah hey guys thats your hangup not mine  laughter  marisha i feel like im learning so much about you vax  liam my name is pronounced liam  laughter  matt as you guys gather your things you make your way back out into the thoroughfare of the  arches where you can see there is now a heavier patrolling guard of illuminated in the vicinity  marisha we put our chains back on 
none	  laura i walk up to percy before we put our horrible chains back on and i grab his hand and  i give him a peck on the cheek and whisper thank you  taliesin youre welcome and yes that was weird for me too just weird right now  laura just a peck  taliesin yes thank you but its weird  liam after my bit with scanlan i put the ring back on and spend the next 20 minutes attuning to  it and she hears behind her mocking oh thank you i love you so much

none	 you guys staying in the  public eye youve watched how other people walked about the city the lack of communication from  folks that dont seem to be on the upper echelon and avoiding as much of the illuminated as you  can with their flaming amulets  eventually you find your way back to the large slowly spiraling blackandgold abode of juuraiel  the door has the same knob on the front you knock the door is lifted and the two fire giant  slaves greet you and lead you into the home there across the way on 
none	 the other side of her large  desk still waiting arms crossed fingers intertwined you see grinning the ever opulently  dressed juuraiel waiting for you all to approach quietly with a smile on her face her eyebrows  tensed and furrowed expecting either a sweet victory or word of a sweet defeat either way she wins  taliesin we have the necklace  marisha i take out the necklace and throw it at her feet or on the table in front of her  matt she reaches down and plucks it it dangles she looks at it so it 
none	 is done then  marisha if word has not reached you by now honestly im quite surprised  travis im not we were super stealthy as requested  laura yeah we were  marisha word of mouth its a small city  taliesin died in disgrace as well plot to overthrow the sultan  liam a disembodied voice says totally  matt you can see the brow unfurls ever so slightly and a look of peace washes over her face  for a moment she takes the small amulet in her hand and clutches her fingers around it and closes 
none	  her eyes youve done me a great service this day and you have upheld your end of the bargain  for this i thank you she pulls a drawer open in the desk and plops it in slams it shut slam i  absolve you of the ownership i have against you my servants will collect your necklaces thank  you thank you very much  laura thank you for the plate mail as well  matt yes my apologizes its been a long day she reaches up and takes the armor pieces there  and sets it on 
none	 the edge of the desk  sam just curious what do you say we play one hand  taliesin laura and travis no  sam oh okay all right  marisha i think youve done enough gambling for today  ashley just for funsies  matt now the deal is done get out  laura goodbye thank you  marisha would you care if we do a little teleportation spell in your living room  matt i would recommend doing it towards the foyer door  marisha right because youve got thank you  laura thank you do you want

none	 everywhere but the plate which is about human  size its too large for pike and it gets loose when you get inside of it its hanging off of  her once you get the last piece of the armor on she looks like a child wearing her parents  clothing  travis perfect  matt and then with a creaking sound all armor snaps to her form and you watch as the beautiful  brass scrolling across the armor itself begins to brighten you can see bits where the scrolling  glows with this pulsing almost internal fire and 
none	 the rubies gleam and you see the air around her  begin to distort like the air distortion over a hot flame  laura oh my gosh oh jeez  sam weve got to read it to you  laura and you got rubies all over you and stuff  liam well completionists we fucking did it  marisha legendary weapons  ashley aw i cant really read it  sam laura will read it in ashleys voice  matt yeah travis read it in ashleys voice  travis highpitched oh beautiful brass scrolling and priceless  ashley all right

dung	 to be greedy milady but whats the story with that ruby shield  laughter  matt you start walking up wearing the armor you just won and ask her this question  ashley i feel like it matches thats my only reason im asking  matt both of her hands reach up over the desk because you can barely see her from your vantage  point youre so small by comparison both of her hands reach over grasp the edge and she leans  forward looming over you her large grinning dark skin vibrant red hair braided adorned with  
none	 jewels and metallic bands of platinum she leans down it is not for you to worry about now  leave me to my collection youve already taken one from me  ashley well it wasnt taken from you okay thank you so much  laughter  travis you look awesome pike  laura you look amazing pike  travis is it actually hotter in that armor are you sweaty in there  matt its actually very comfortable and quite cool  sam can you read what it says ashley  laura is it quieter than her other mail  matt 
none	 no  laughter  ashley its still loud  matt its still pretty loud  ashley should i read it  sam yes please read it  ashley okay beautiful brass scrolling and priceless cut rubies adorn this silver set of  armor worn by the high priest duana of pelor as she fell in the battle of ghor dranas while  wearing this armor you gain a plusthree bonus to ac  travis oh thats not the best part  taliesin what it gets better  ashley you cannot be frightened and you gain resistance to fire damage and 
none	 when you are struck  by a melee attack the attacker suffers 2d6 points of fire damage  taliesin it gets better  ashley if you are knocked unconscious by an attack or spell a blast of healing flame  surrounds you you immediately regain five hit points and are lifted to your feet all harmful  creatures within 15 feet of you must make a dexterity saving throw or take 6d6 fire damage  half damage on a success and once youve used this ability you cannot use it again until the  next dawn  sam what so 
none	 if someone kills her they hurt more  liam she bounces back from death one time a day  matt from unconsciousness yeah  taliesin unconsciousness one time a day  travis if they hit her they take damage  laura if she goes unconscious they get blasted  sam holy shit  taliesin thats nuts  ashley oh man  travis that is amazing  ashley what the heck  matt its a good vestige  marisha thats amazing  laura guys we got all the vestiges  marisha we got all of our legendary weapons  travis and

none	 if we are in midthordak battle and he shows up to  collect were fucked  travis yeah id button it up  marisha well if we go back though what if he wants to cash in right now i gave him the  bracelet deliberately  travis i dont think that meant were going to leave the fire plane before we settle the favor  that he constantly reminds that we owe him  liam look we didnt have the time to come here period so lets go talk to him and ask him if we  can have 
none	 a few days to get back to him if we die problem solved  laura hed make us owe him another fucking favor  taliesin may i also recommend that we leave the children out of that room  marisha yeah remember were dragging children everywhere we go  sam can you send those children back  travis the mansion is still up isnt it  laura no but wed have to walk all the fuck back  marisha look he mentioned let me give you a trinket in case you all leave so i can find you again
