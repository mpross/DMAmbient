none	 marisha well be back go follow  and then well pull winners  travis right listen up if you have ale  then you have a friend in grog strongjaw  a goliath of towering height and size  this barbarian has an appetite  for the two great loves in his life  combat women  and ale  record scratch  wait  easily the brains of the group  grog is often consulted for his vast knowledge  of shapes colors and shiny things  also ale  in his early years armed with his two handed 
none	 great axe  grog often enjoyed proving his might amongst  brawling sounds grog often enjoyed proving his might amongst  the ranks of his familys wandering herd brawling sounds  the ranks of his familys wandering herd  but after coming upon an unsuspecting  elderly gnome in the woods  he objected to the killing such an innocent life  a creature of impulse grog felt only pity for this  well this terrified little thing  and his disobedience cost him dearly  weapon crack beaten bloody and banished by the herd leader  beaten bloody and 
none	 banished by the herd leader  his uncle kevdak  grog was abandoned and left to die  exiled from his herd it was then that  the relative of the very gnome he fought to save  saved him  it was the kindness of a gnome cleric named pike  that healed grog bringing him back from deaths edge  and they have remained close friends ever since  most nights grog can be found challenging  entire taverns to wrestling matches ha  or accompanying scanlan to the nearest house  where you pay for  lady 
none	 favors  also ale  marisha a first impression of keyleth would  leave you with little information  on the halfelven druid  you might even think that her social awkwardness  due to her sheltered upbringing is kind of sweet  chuckle  of course it would be unwise to underestimate her  based on first impressions  thunder crack based on first impressions  under that unintimidating petite frame  is a vicious beast waiting to be unleashed  whose natural powers have made even the fiercest of  champions pee their pants literally  soft chuckle 
none	  born to the air tribe of the ashari people  keyleth was raised with a deep love  of nature and the elemental magics  it is her people’s inherent duty to protect  the delicate areas in taldorei  where the four elemental planes begin to bleed with this realm  since she was a little girl she had quite a knack  for air manipulation and beast shaping abilities  well if you consider kittens and  flying squirrels to be little beasts  which i do  clears throat  anyways it wasnt long before the 
none	 headmaster of the tribe  her father kohren  realized her true prodigious abilities  and she was inveterated to succeed him as the next headmaster  just like that her jovial childhood was stripped  and replaced with endless spell memorization  teachings from ancient traditions  and exceedingly high expectations  every druid leader to be must embark on  a journey to seek out the sister tribes  in order to introduce and establish respect  amongst the fellow headmasters  they call this the aramente or noble odyssey  when her father felt she was ready 
none	  he set her on the path to truly discovering herself  not knowing when or if she will ever return  as she hiked down the mountain towards stillben  she meditated on the task ahead  part of the aramente is proving yourself  a strong warrior a valiant protector  and a wise and compassionate leader  with this knowledge  one thought plays in repeat in her mind  is she even worthy  taliesin percy was the third child of seven children  born to a noble family who lived far to the north  
dung	 in the ancient castle of whitestone  with so many siblings to share the burdens of  lordship percy turned his attention to the  sciences engineering and naturalism  one day a mysterious couple  named lord and lady briarwood came to court  during a feast held in their honour  the briarwoods violently took control of the castle  killing or imprisoning everyone  who would stand in their way  percy awoke chained in the dungeon  only to be freed by his younger sister  together they fled chased by the briarwoods’ men  as 
none	 they ran percy’s sister took  several arrows to the chest and fell  percy kept running eventually jumping into  a freezing river and floating unconscious to freedom  he did not remember waking up on a fishing boat  he barely remembered the next two years  as he slowly made his way as far south as possible  then one night percy had a dream  a roaring cloud of smoke offered him  vengeance against those who destroyed his family  when he awoke percy began to design his first gun  gun cocks and fires 
town	  ashley pike grew up in the outskirts of town  near the bramblewood  her ancestors were a family of deep gnomes  with quite an unfavorable reputation  thievery destruction and trickery left them  with the curse of the last name trickfoot  sarenrae the goddess of healing and redemption  had other plans for pikes greatgreatgrandfather wilhand  who left his family at a young age after a dream  a dream that changed the course of the trickfoot family  wilhand devoted his life to sarenrae  and pledged from then on that him and 
none	 his family  would live a life of service and devotion  as a child pike seemed to have an affinity to heal  whether it was animals people or even flowers  she felt she had a purpose in making things whole  that had once been broken  she studied and learned the ways to heal  though divine magic  she lived a peaceful life quiet and simple  until one day wilhand was captured  and almost killed by a group of goliath barbarians  one of the goliaths took a stand  against the murder 
none	 of the innocent gnome  and he himself was beaten bloodied and left for dead  abandoned by his herd  wilhand went to pike for help  she prayed and healed this barbarian as best she could  bringing him back to life  when he awoke she discovered his name  was grog strongjaw  after that they were best of friends  a rather unlikely pair  little did she know that in a few years time  grog would soon return the favor  and bring her back from the clutches of death  creature growl 
none	 and snapping  after being killed in battle  pike felt angry  she wanted to be stronger  so that it would never happen again  she spent four months at sea  training with the men and women  aboard a ship called the broken howl  gripping her holy symbol in one hand  and her morningstar in the other  this time pike is ready  sam oh you haven’t heard of scanlan shorthalt  well gird your loins ladies  because he has his eye on you  a talented musician master of disguise  
none	 and dashingly handsome in his own mind  scanlan sings songs  almost as much as he sings his own praises  born a poor gnome scanlan used  his endless charm and soaring tenor voice  to croon for coin and support his single mother  one day he was discovered by a halforc promoter  and joined dr dranzel’s spectacular traveling troupe  where he learned the ways of the world  and honed his skills as a bard extraordinaire  a loner much of his life scanlan has never quite  come to terms with the violent 
town	 death of his mother  at the hands of a goblin invasion  while his years on the road provided many shall we say  educational experiences with the opposite sex  deep down scanlan yearns for the one thing  he’s never known  the true love of a fellow gnome  still scanlan considers himself a lover first  performer second and fighter distant third  on the battlefield he’ll support his allies  but rarely draws blood unless it’s to protect  fellow gnome pike  count on scanlan for a hearty laugh  a rollicking song 
town	 and a twinkle in his eye  that melts hearts and makes the females swoon  orion greetings and salutations  i am tiberius stormwind  i hail from a town called tyrex  located in the heart of draconia  born from a politically respected family  at the age of 15  i succeeded in passing the sorcerer’s rite  showing prodigylike control of my magic  the judges and the draconian high council were amazed  at how powerful my spells were  for how long i had been training  at 20 years old i was 
none	 the youngest appointed member  of the magic guild in draconian history  for the next few years i almost went mad  from the malaise of being a guild member  as it’s rather boring  however one day i happened upon a chamber  unused for quite some time  in the room were stacks of books and maps  of the surrounding cities and areas  around the known world  for months i would frequent the chamber  and learned of artifacts from legend  after a long period of research  i made a list 
town	 of artifacts that caught my eye  i brought these findings to the high council  and was told that all of the information  in the chamber i had stumbled upon  was either believed to be fiction or unsolvable mysteries  and hence were lost forever  i found those answers to be unacceptable  a year later i devised a ruse  and managed to convince the city council  to lend support in me leaving draconia  on a mission of peace and diplomacy  for the surrounding kingdoms  going from town to town and 
none	 making friends and allies  in and for the name of draconia  being a red dragonborn  i had quite the task on my hands in that respect  but it was exactly what i needed  so i could explore the world and find these artifacts  as i felt the truth was out there  some may describe me as buffoonish  but i say poppycock to all that  i am much sharper than most give me credit for  i just don’t pay attention to things sometimes  i’ve also been known to be rather 
none	 cunning loyal  happygolucky and well dangerous  i can’t help but show my true scales every now and then  but overall i think i’m quite friendly for a dragonborn  liam never entirely welcome in the company of elves or men  vaxildan learned at a young age to skip past formality  preferring instead to invite himself in your door  along with twin sister vexahlia  vax was born by a chance encounter between  elven royalty and human peasantry  raised by their mother in their early years  the twins were eventually sent off 
town	  to their father in the elven capital of singorn  but their cool reception among the elves there never warmed  and their time in the capital didn’t last  the siblings stole away one autumn night  and set out on the open road  after a few years of wandering  they eventually decided to return to their mother  and journeyed back to the lands of their youth  but instead of finding their childhood home  they returned to a pile of rubble  their mother was gone their home burned to ash  pressing 
none	 the townspeople for answers  they learned of the day the dragon came  roaring  with their ties all severed vaxildan and his sister  set out to find their fortune together in taldorei  an outsider since birth vax quickly learned  to solve life’s challenges in his own particular way  often by sidestepping them entirely  and when his knack for circumventing adversity isn’t enough  sword unsheathing and slashing  the way of blades the elves schooled him in  more than makes up the difference  laura like so many halfelves  vexahlia has 
none	 spent most of her life suffering  the cool reception of a people who don’t fully accept her  born of a human mother and an elven father  who only later in life took an interest in their existence  vexahlia and her twin brother vaxildan  quickly realized the only people  they could truly rely on in this world  were each other  it was at the age of 10 when the two were taken  from their mother and brought to live in singorn  the isolated elven city for which  their father was 
none	 an ambassador  he quietly took them in but always kept an icy distance  and after too many years of disdainful looks  the pair decided to leave his indifference behind  and set out on their own  vax took to the cities stealing small trinkets  and learning the ways of the thief  while vex kept to the woods  she preferred the isolation  always the keen observer  she learned to hunt and to track to spy and to shoot  and through a series of fateful events  earned herself a companion in 
town	 the form of a bear   her own stolen trinket   to fight alongside her and protect her fiercely  also he is adorable and gives expert massages  matt welcome back guys  we have some interesting aspects of playing tonight  orion acaba will be here shortly  hes currently stuck in traffic  unfortunately we will not have a sam riegel tonight  due to his schedule  ashley scanlan  marisha no scanlan  matt laura bailey and travis willingham  our loving grog and vex are out of town in florida  but

dung	  matt so for those of us who   matt just a little heads up here  the party has just returned after a long arduous trek  through the underdark  beneath the dwarven city of kraghammer  matt they were sent to retrieve a paladin named  lady kima of vord who was on a vision quest  to stop some dark evil that her deity bahamut  told her was existing beneath this mountain range  and needed to be squelched  matt the party managed to salvage her from insidious torture  and through her 
none	 aid as well as a mind flayer  who had been outcast from the society  and the colony nearby  matt they managed to convince to help them as well  fought their way through the tunnels  past the duergar army eventually to  the underground mindflayer colony of yogg voril  where they found that this entity called kvarn  this was then eventually revealed  to be a mad beholder kvarn  who had been pseudo possessed  and given additional power by the horn of orcus  a great and evil artifact long forgotten  
none	 which had been found by this entity  so they managed to make their way  into the temple kill kvarn  tear the horn from its forehead  however found themselves swarmed immediately  by an entire colony of mind flayers  heading toward the top of this temple  they managed to battle and battle  nearly losing a few party members  and through some ingenuity escape through the top  glide over the city of yogg voril  through this underground chasm to a distant embankment  along the beachside of this underground lake  and 
none	 teleport their way back to their base city of emon  so theyve come back to emon  theyve come to their keep greyskull keep  and theyve had an evening of rest  upon waking the next morning  theyve managed to get some breakfast  theyve freed lady kima from her stone entrapment  as she was turned to stone  during the battle with the beholder  and had a conversation based around  what should or could be done  about this horn of orcus evil artifact  so here we will pick up again from 
none	 that point  so the rest of you guys have eaten your meal  kima hungrily doing so  all of you guys both sore and exhausted  having barely seen sunlight for a little over a week  and being probably the first or second good meal  youve had since leaving kraghammer proper  you all finish your food grog hungrily so  double the size of his normal intake of  delicious meats and starches  tiberius has not seemed to have woken up  or found his way down from his room as of yet  
none	 however you guys did recently receive  a rolled up piece of parchment  a notification from the council of tal’dorei  saying that you have been requested to  the council chambers at some point this afternoon  around the midday sun to discuss your return  and the situation and conditions about it  and that was all it said  liam i cant remember is lady kima with us at this point  is she unstoned  matt shes unstoned  youve already had the conversation with her last week  talking about the horn basically interrogating 
none	 her  liam and we said that we had it somewhere safe  but werent we playing coy with that  matt you were playing coy with it but you   ashley i had gone downstairs to go get grog  matt yes grog returned with it  and you guys had the conversation basically saying  ‘oh its safe dont worry its fine’  grog at which currently has it in the bag of holding  marisha but we havent told her  that its in the bag of holding right  matt no you just said you

none	 have utilized and they are part of our culture  percy ive never seen a skinned one  tiberius yes and so i went to the local shoppe  and purchased a bag of holding because i realized  that i did not hold my own wheel of mending for a long time  percy that was frustrating you wasnt it  tiberius it was extremely frustrating  especially because its my artifact  tiberius yes  keyleth well thats good  its probably good to have a second one of those  keyleth and it comes with water how 
none	 handy  tiberius it holds a lot of things  keyleth how fantastic  percy we should probably get off to see  what the emperor wants  tiberius before we do that   orion wheres scanlan now  keyleth not here  matt scanlan is currently in the room eating breakfast  orion were all eating breakfast still right  matt yeah  orion hi everybody  liam not you youve apparently been globe shopping  tiberius right scanlan  i was thinking about our last encounter  orion im going to  take off my ion stone

none	  and sits up from the table with a loud fart  and you guys make your way out of greyskull keep  matt towards the outer wall of emon  in towards the entrance to abedars promenade  making your way towards the cloudtop district  where the palace itself resides is there any place   laura is lady kima with us  matt lady kima is with you yes  taliesin good  matt is there anything else you want to do  or are you guys making a beeline for the palace  orion i would

none	  you can see that her ivory tower  which once collapsed around you  is now standing in its previous location  seemingly untouched and back to its original esteemed visual  percy that is the question do we stop in first  or do we go straight to   vax was there a time requested on there  matt it said around the noon day sun  its probably about 30 minutes give or take  vax alluras really the only person i trust  percy perhaps we should not walk into the palace  with this 
none	 on us so to speak  vax we dont have anything on us  percy no we dont but if we did  we should probably deal with it  percy what  vax yes  percy no yes laughs  vax tibbsy lets go ring alluras bell  grog id like to ring her bell  taliesin its like having the internet right there  liam so i just start walking off towards alluras tower  orion ill follow vax  matt okay everyone else go with them  percy yeah  ashley yeah  matt so you guys 
town	 trek your way towards  the northern edge of the cloudtop district  you round about the series of  very nice fine marbled houses finely crafted stone  this is the affluent area of emon proper  its in the secondary city wall which of course  the upper echelon of merchants  and those who have money are offered  the secondary form of defense  against the town being sieged at all  matt you come around the corner on the fine kind of  yellowish cobblestone road turn  and you get to the point where 
town	 you can see  to the left of you is the giant courtyard that  surrounds the outskirts of the palace proper  with the giant steps that lead up  to the darkened purple marble  that the entire structure is made out of  to your right theres a few buildings  and the white ivory tower that allura lives in  you approach the front door is closed  it still remains that giant iron knocker on the front  that hangs loosely like a giant wishbone  that you slam into the front of the wooden 
none	 doorway  matt give it a couple hits  vax nods  matt you can hear it echo throughout the interior  of the tall standing tower  a few moments pass  you hear the movement of chain  a creaking of metal and then a   some sort of large shifting of a wood platform or plank  the door then creaks open  and there standing a little bleary eyed  sleptin a bit but in the process of getting ready  you see before you arcanist allura  her long blonde hair is half braided 
none	  shes in her darkened blue robes  youre used to seeing her in and see   she opens the door the sunlight hitting her eye  she protects her vision for a second  before they focus on the rest of the group and she goes  allura my lord youve all arrived  youve all arrived  matt and she swings the door opens  and runs forward immediately to you  the first person thats there and she gives you a big hug  matt she holds back and gives you a look over  matt 
none	 her eyes are opened  you can see how honestly eager  and happy to see that everyones here safe  liam i look over at tiberius and just short of sheepishly shrug  tiberius im used to it its fine  matt she turns over to give pike a big hug  she makes her way around the rest of the group  allura youre all im so glad to see youre all back  ive heard there was some difficulties  happening in kraghammer at the time you arrived  matt she turns around and takes your hands 
dung	 keyleth  into her own and gives you a nod and a small hug  goes to percy and gives you a hug  goes to tiberius and gives you a big warm hug  matt she slowly pulls away  she acquiesces to your longer hug  and then pushes away  tiberius it is nice to see you again  allura the pleasure is mine  vex sings awkward  everyone laughs  allura the pleasure is mine tiberius  matt and as she turns around  she sees standing behind the rest of you theres kima  
none	 there in her now freshly cleaned golden armor  that she polished over the evening so she doesnt  smell of duergar sweat and blood anymore  vax weve brought you a present  matt theres this moment where they both look at each other quietly  and then allura steps forward and says  allura kima welcome back  matt and they both just run and give this  big embracing bear hug  she lifts kima up and theres a slow spin  you can see this very very strong bond of friendship  before she eventually puts 
none	 kima down and  takes a little bit she holds her hands for a second  you can see a tear running down alluras cheek  allura i was so worried about you  matt and kima sheepishly turns her eyes to the side and says  kima sorry for the all the trouble  tiberius story of my life  all laugh  orion seriously matthew come on  matt what  all laugh  matt theyre good friends  liam friends friends  marisha laughs  orion friends  matt your assumptions dragonborn  all laugh  liam 
none	 dont mug yourself  taliesin thats great  liam come correct dont mug yourself  matt laughs  matt they take a moment to just nod at each other  she reaches her hand out in front of kimas head  and rustles her hair for a second and says  allura you had many of us worried sick  you cant keep running off like that  matt and kima says  kima i know i know  matt then allura turns to the rest of the group and says  allura thank you all so so very much 
none	  youve done the realm and myself  a great service in bringing her back  matt at which point kima says  kima bring me back  they helped me complete my quest  youve made some strong allies allie  matt and allura starts heading back into her tower and says  keyleth allie matt and allura starts heading back into her tower and says  allura well come enter i have tea ready  vex i like it allura well come enter i have tea ready  allura well come enter i have tea ready  you 
none	 all look like you could use it to be honest  pike yeah  allura come please  percy well all right  tiberius i love tea  percy we have a moment we can spend  vax long story  matt so as you guys all walk into her tower you remember it  untouched from your previous entry here  its a weird moment to step into a tower  that you were once in as it crumbled and folded on itself  to see it as if nothing had ever happened  taliesin is there a new 
none	 rug  matt there is not  taliesin ahhah  laura hmm  marisha were not giving it back  laura we shouldnt tell her about the rug  marisha dont tell her about the rug  matt you guys step into the center of the room and shes  talking to herself for a moment saying  allura things have been a bit crazy here obviously  now that the floodgates have opened as far as  discussions with the council and people who have  maintained a backlog for a while its been a bit busy  but 
none	 this is a wonderful moment to respite  im greatly enjoying the company to be honest  come  matt she guides you all to the center of the chamber  once again theres that large stone platform in the center  that has a number of the  inert runes carved into the stonework  as you all step onto it  she taps her heel against the bottom of it for a second  as she does all the runes glow with a bright flash of blue  and a familiar sensation as that circular platform  begins 
none	 to lift like an arcane elevator  up the center of the tower  going up one two three stories  and as youre going up youre seeing  certain sections of  wooden library shelves set up at odd angles  along the top of the arcane tower itself  you can see there are small stairways  that lead off into doorways that seem to almost  exit into the sky  matt youve gotten into the idea that a lot of these  powerful magebuilt towers the  inner workings dont really match the outer exterior look 
none	  and there are rooms that shouldnt exist  at certain points as you lift up  liam id like to make a perfunctory insight check  just to see if theres anything hinky  orion id like to google perfunctory real quick  matt you can do that go for it  liam okay  matt on allura  liam yeah everythings probably fine  thats an 18  matt best that you can gather she looks  like shes a bit groggy having slept in recently  but she seems extremely excited youve all  returned and seems 
none	 eager to catch up  as far as what has transpired since last you met her  matt the platform continues before it reaches  the topmost floor of the tower before  the slowing of the stone platform  eventually comes to a halt with a slight jostling  the runes fade and youre all  on the top floor of the tower once again  this is her main chamber  you can see across the way there is  her large cush canopy bed in the far corner  there are a number of desks  theres 
none	 a small arcane laboratory on the far side  looks like its in a bit of disarray  as shes probably in the middle of a project  matt you do hear as soon as you arrive  it sounds like the whistle of a tea kettle in the distance  at which point she says  allura ah allow me  matt and she begins to walk over  she lifts her hand and you see a small drift  of arcane energy as her mage hand goes and lifts  takes the water off of its burner  
none	 and begins to absent mindedly magehand various teacups  out of a large cabinet above the little kitchenette area  ashley thats awesome  all laugh  matt at which point everyones looking around  kima amongst the rest of you guys says  kima its been awhile since ive been here  everythings as grandiose  and unnecessarily dressed as it always is  im glad you got rid of that old rug though  laura laughs  scattered coughing  vax sorry  liam coughs  pike was there a rug  vax im fine  percy i 
none	 dont remember that  keyleth stay cool come on  grog this rug  vex nope  percy nope  pike nope  percy not here  matt allura who is now in the process of pulling chairs over  and setting up a small sitting arrangement  a semicircle and says  keyleth it’s so cute  allura the last time the tower collapsed  and i was so rudely assaulted in my living quarters  it appears my rug went missing its all right  ive kept my eye out for a new one for some time  
none	 tiberius that was unfortunate  vax magic its tricky  tiberius i had no idea i jumped out when that happened  percy speaking of tricky magic  matt she gives a slow knowing look about the group  and gives a nod like i acquiesce to this thats fine  keyleth you should have some potted plants allura  like some nice greenery  percy youre going to try and feng shui the tower  is that what you  keyleth well why not  percy i dont know  allura thats not a bad idea perhaps well discuss 
none	 this  vax this is silly  vax allura its a long story lot of deurgar  lot of mindflayer lot of mindflayers and an evil god  percy a beholder  tiberius yes moreover a beholder  vax yes but who was pulling the strings behind the beholder  keyleth he thought he was an evil god  a beholder with a god complex  allura curious  matt at which point as you say that  she does this with her fingers  and all the chairs rush in underneath you guys  and youre put into a 
none	 sitting position  as you all sit she begins to slowly magehand over  each one of you a freshly poured cup of tea  matt a look of concern comes across her face  allura so you found your way beneath the city  i assume based on the denizens youve mentioned  into the underdark proper  a beholder you say  mindflayers you say  percy yes  allura i first off must apologize i was not aware  i was putting you into such dangerous territory  tiberius ha  it was really dangerous  it 
none	 was nothing filled with just buttholes everywhere  terrible  allura that sounds like a terrible city  tiberius mhm  marisha laughs  allura well first and foremost i apologize for that  i am incredibly grateful youre all  seemingly healthy and still here  and youve brought kima back to us which is very important  allura well i guess this is in order  matt and she sits up for a second and walks over  and you can see she looks back at the rest of you and  brushes her hand for a second 
none	  a sphere of darkness appears in the corner of the room  where you can not see an entire part of the room  and she sits there and hovers  just a little pocket of darkness  marisha aw man  pike whats that  matt you hear some rustling  keyleth weve been in darkness so long matt you hear some rustling  matt you hear some rustling  matt the sphere of darkness finishes  and you see shes holding a sack of coins  that you dont know where she picked them up from  
none	 keyleth oh  matt she steps back over to her chair sits down and says  allura just a precaution  i like to keep my private things private  but a deal is a deal and youve done as youve asked  so as weve discussed 10000 gold pieces  to the lot of you and my greatest thanks  laura i take that to the lot of you and my greatest thanks  all laugh  matt she hands it out to vexs eager palm  its very heavy  laura good thing im strong then huh  
none	 matt with her 9 strength it sags  laura sorry about the hand gesture there stop it  all laugh  matt internet  matt she sits back down says  allura you tell me what else if anything has transpired  and ill let you know what youve missed  pike well  tiberius we have orcuss horn so thats a thing  matt theres a slight pause before the actual sound of  breaking glass hits your ears  as the teacup that shes holding  shatters across the stonework on the floor  matt allura still sitting 
none	 in her chair  hands in place and says  allura im sorry what did you say  tiberius yes that beholder butthole that we had to fight  that we had no idea we had to fight  had this orcus horn on his head  so we took it off and we kept it safe  thats what you wanted im assuming to destroy it  vex but we havent touched it though  tiberius no  allura all right  matt she looks over to kima  who does this with her shoulders up  kima gives 
none	 her a nod and says  kima to be honest  i wasnt sure that was the end of my journey  but it seems that great evil i talked about before  we killed it and took its source of power  now were figuring out what to do with it  matt she gives a sheepish grin and a slight shrug in her armor  allura looks to the ground for a moment and says  allura i dont know much of this object you say  but if it was the source of the creatures power  
none	 and it carries with it the connotations of orcus  then this is a very very ill omen indeed  tiberius yes  allura this must be brought before the council immediately  tiberius wait  keyleth the council  tiberius the council  allura the council of taldorei the council you are part of  tiberius that helps  pike are you going there right now also  allura yes i was summoned to it  pike we were as well tiberius heres the thing  tiberius sorry pike  the thing with this particular item is  the 
none	 more people know about it  the more dangerous it actually becomes  the fact that we even share this information with kima  and with you is a very dangerous thing to begin with  allura i agree  tiberius are the council trustworthy  allura those who currently reside on the council are trustworthy  i assure you this  ive done my work with them for many years  and those that have passed have been replaced  with equally trustworthy individuals  and rest assured  i have my checks and balances in place as well 
none	  vax i think what were worried about most is  the corrupting nature of this thing  and while the council may have good intentions  i think more than a few of us are somewhat nervous  what effect it might have on them on us  allura can you assess what the mistrust would be  to not bring this before the sovereign and the council  tiberius namely if the immediate want is  for it to be immediately destroyed  because thats what needs to happen with  anything from orcus as you very well 
none	 know  allura i understand  and i dont think youll find anyone who disagrees  but i also dont think you should sow mistrust with the council  by keeping any of this information from them  keyleth its not about trust  vex uriel has been corrupted once already  keyleth exactly  allura this is true and was it not by your hand  that he was freed and his family kept safe  understand that this is a man that  owes you him and his familys life  i think he would take in to 
none	 you  his ear bent in your direction quite strongly  keyleth correct but couldnt you also safely say  that he is therefore fairly easy corruptible  if he had been corrupted before even not if subconsciously  im not saying intentionally but he clearly  allura you would know best  what was responsible for corrupting our sovereign  as you did fight and one was felled  by its own strength  keyleth im saying lady allura that there is  essences there seems to be magical properties to this horn  that corrupt even some of 
none	 the strongest willed individuals  allura then we must be rid of it quickly  and i think we need to at least discuss this  with the council if not present it  bring it to their attention  there are ways arcane  not very approved ways  of nullifying targeted memories  the rest of the arcana pentsafocal have banned  the use of such magics but if we could have approval  understanding the safety concerns of this object  from the council we could override the arcana pentsafocal  and i could employ some of 
none	 these magics to make sure that  once this artifact is destroyed  or taken somewhere to never be found again  we ourselves perhaps would not recall it ever existed  and that itself is the safest course of action  tiberius i agree  vax i think that we trust you  and you trust the council thats enough for me  percy thats enough for me as well  keyleth pike where do you stand  tiberius thats definitely enough for me keyleth pike where do you stand  tiberius just so you know allura   
none	 tiberius i might have  a solution as well for actually destroying it  so i will follow your lead  percy i think the best course of action is to trust people  vax and were incapable of destroying the thing on our own  tiberius oh thats not true at all  i might have a solution which i just shared with allura  im letting her take the lead on this  and when the situation presents itself  i might have a solution to destroy it outright  vex why dont you share that with us 
none	 now tiberius  instead of keeping it secret  vax just give us a rough sketch maybe instead of keeping it secret  tiberius very well  orion ill pull out my bag of holding  tiberius this  keyleth the mending wheel  tiberius no the bag  laura an empty fist  liam he pulled out the bag  keyleth okay would you care to elaborate tiberius  tiberius im sorry  this part of the thing i wanted to tell all of you at breakfast  the idea is with some research  ive come to find 
none	 that if anything is in a bag of holding  and the bag of holding itself is destroyed  the items or whatever go into a somewhat void  that cannot be retrieved by any one particular thing  if we are to have our memories erased as you say  then it would guarantee that when we place the  thing in a bag of holding and destroy that bag  it will then be dissipated into that void  matt at which point allura raises her hand and says  allura tiberius you as a very trained sorcerer 
none	  have some knowledge in this regard  ive been crafting bags of holding since i was a child  as a way of keeping my weekends busy  i have to notify you that should such a pocket of  interdimensional arcane space is disrupted in this way  it doesnt send it into a void  it jettisons the contents into the astral sea  the astral sea which has many denizens  that could come across this object  githyanki themselves and their great ships  tiberius i hate yankees  allura gith nevermind  pike so 
none	 it could be bad  tiberius there are things   allura there are many things that exist in the astral sea  that could recover this item  im not saying there isnt merit to this but i think  it would be best we put it somewhere  where at least we know for certain no one will find it  as opposed to just hoping it disappears somewhere  tiberius but the memory thing is crucial  keyleth what about those who might be uncomfortable with  toying around with my memories  and tramping along around 
none	 in my head  i dont really want   vax why dont you think about it for a while  grog my heads pretty fragile as it is  vax were talking about erasing the path back to this thing  were not talking about removing your  adolescent years from your memory just this one thing  grog all right  keyleth how many lessons have we learned in just the time  wouldnt we have to erase all memories surrounding it  we wouldnt even remember our trip into the underdark  percy i think we could 
none	 perhaps just erase  the memory of where we put it  tiberius that is what i assume will happen  allura that is possible  like ive said these magics have not been tampered with  in nearly 200 years  keyleth so were gonna break the seal on some  untamperedwith magics and just experiment  allura i am part of a group that oversees civilization  i cant go into too much detail  but they are responsible for keeping such ancient magics  long forgotten magics such as this  i would have to  meet 
none	 with and discuss and gain approval for its use  but for an item as dangerous as what you say  perhaps this is one of those special occasions  liam shes working for the illuminati and were basically  the ateam so i think she might know a little better  taliesin the ateam  keyleth what do you think pike  pike i feel like at this point  we dont really have another option  pike and i do trust allura  tiberius im all tapped out pike and i do trust allura  pike so i 
none	 feel like if we just  go check it out  i dont really know what our other option is  pike that was a good one  vax and if we dont like it we can step  percy and if we dont like it  we can keep thinking of something else  we have time  allura this is true and who knows what wisdom  the rest of the council might have in their midst as well  allura they have members from all across the world  well see which resources they have at their 
none	 disposal  percy im sure theyre waiting for us  allura i am glad to be free of my usual business  are you guys familiar with the wilder fens  vax sorry the wilder fens  allura the wilder fens  theyre a bloody merchant guild  theyve left our chambers in shambles  look since youve been gone and the council map  has been brought brought up to speed once more  weve had to deal with the backlog of all the various  council meetings that have been  pushed back and pushed back for months 
none	 and months  its been rather nightmarish  so this all dangerous as it is im taking it as a  nice change from the usual  pardon my speaking  political bullshit ive been dragged into on a weekly basis  between wilder fens  and there was the cortigian league from wildmount  and they just tore through emon with a caravan of  partying gypsies that destroyed everything in their path  keyleth who  tiberius damn gypsies  allura the cortian league  marisha the cortian league  allura from wildmount the north  percy we 
town	 fought stitch monsters that was mostly what we  it was guns and swords and  allura its far more interesting  most of our guests have been a bit rough around the edges  although i would say  we did manage to meet with syldor of syngorn  we have some business there getting syngorn situated  vex oh syldor allura and lord and lady briarwood  were rather nice to us when they came into the town  so business has been fair  percy shall we take this to the council then  vax yes we 
none	 have pressing matters  well get to that later  allura all right lets go to the council then  matt as you guys make your way back down through the tower  you eventually venture through  the castletop district in front of the palace  the guards stand there with their  long red velvet cloaks and their brass breastplates  they recognize both allura and you as you approach  they step aside put their spears toward the steps  and give you a grand entrance to the front of the palace  matt as you step 
none	 up the front doors open on their own  with a large heavy shaking of the wood  as the palace doors open  you are led into the central chambers  of the main palace walkway which splits to the right and left  and then across leads into the main throne room  however you guys are meeting in the council room  which is to the left youve been there twice before  matt so youre led over to the council chambers  which as you enter the main circular room  youre brought into the nice 
dung	 hardwood floors  the dark forest green colored walls  these long tapestries which recall various battles  of history and broad mountainous landscapes  showing settlers making their way across dangerous terrain  you can see various weapons from different civilizations  that were brought up as gifts to emon  that have been mounted on the walls  as presentory atmospheric decor  and in the central room you can see what currently stands  the entirety of the taldorei council in a hushed discussion  the council of course has at the center  across the table 
dung	 from you  sovereign uriel taldorei the second himself  the leader of emon and the current sovereign  of all of taldorei this section of the continent  you see him with his characteristic dark hair  with greying sides cut shorter than you recall  looks like he recently got a trim  and some very well kept facial hair  hes wearing his ceremonial robes which are  the same gold and red color as the armored soldiers  that greeted you at the front of the palace  next to him you see lord riskell daxio 
none	  the elven male who helped you guys handle  the purchasing of the keep  when you were awarded that at the end of your last journey  hes the master of trade currently within emon  you can see he has long strawberry blonde hair  that is pulled into a tight ponytail to the back  he wears darker clothing  more for decoration than actual use  his armor seems to be loose and more decorative  next to him is guardian tofor brotorus  which youve heard of but have not met before  a 
none	 female dragonborn paladin  marisha say that one more time  guardian whos a what now  matt guardian tofor bratoras  marisha tofor  matt tofor  bratoras her names been mentioned before but this is  the first time you guys have actually seen her in person  ashley its a girl  matt its a female dragonborn paladin  she is adorned in full silvered platinum plate  that has currently carved multiple symbols of bahamut  the platinum dragon  as she looks up and notices you can see  she gives a hand up a 
none	 symbol of greetings towards kima  as kima also gives her hand up  and they both touch the front of their armor  in a symbolic holy way  they both being followers of bahamut  you immediately make that religious connection  between the two of them  she looks across at the rest of the group there  that she doesnt seem to notice eyes meeting with tiberius  this is strange  you havent seen very many dragonborn at all within emon  and as soon as she meets your gaze  she gives you a 
none	 look of deep deep stinkeye  tiberius hello my name is tiberius stormwind  of house stormwind from draconia  tofor from draconia you say  tiberius yes im sure youve heard of  my father kravanas my mother penelope  tofor and perhaps you should close that trap  and sit across the table as far from me as possible   matt she seems to spit the words almost  and sits back in her chair  tiberius mind your tongue  matt the rest of the councils talking amongst themselves  and hearing this slight discussion  
dung	 next to her there is a halfling male in a rangerish garb  wearing what looks like some really fine chain shirt  with a thick dark black cloak  he is shaved bald with tattoos on one side of his face  and he introduces himself  male im terribly sorry i did not mean  for there to be any sort of misunderstanding here  matt he gives a slight nudge to tofor  male i do not believe weve met at this time  my name is seeker asum emring  i am the master of secrets 
none	 here within the council  matt he extends his hand towards you  almost like alleviating the tension  tiberius hi stormwind here  seeker asum i assume youre the ones were waiting for  please have a seat  matt at which the sovereign finishes discussion with  another human which you have not met  he is a built and armored individual  stands probably the tallest of the entire group  thick square jaw unshaven  at which point he puts his hand  on the sovereigns shoulder and says  male i suppose i should introduce 
none	 myself as well  ive heard much about you vox machina  i am arbiter braum goldhand  i have recently taken up as of three months ago  the position that general kreig once held within the city  since he was unfortunately lost to us  there was a need for a new master of law  as since ive had a lot to keep up on  unable to meet you personally until now  but it is a pleasure  ive heard nothing but great things  matt he sits down in his chair  allura 
none	 finds her  side of the table and gestures the rest of you  allura please have a seat  tiberius i stand i dont sit  matt all right  matt the overeign finishes writing some papers  rolls them up snaps twice and a gentleman comes by  he hands him the papers and says  uriel taldorei get this to lady and lord briarwood  as soon as possible thank you  uriel all right  first of all i want to welcome you all back  its been a few weeks since weve seen each other 
none	  ive been recently given word that you unceremoniously  appeared in the center of  the lyceum not but twelve hours ago  worse for wear  so i would like to know first off  why youve returned in the center of our city  and i want to see how youve all  been these past few weeks  i apologize if im a bit scattered  i’ve had a few things on my mind as of late  but yes how is vox machina  vax if i may  we didnt choose to dump ourselves 
none	  right in the middle of the city  that was born out of necessity not out of choice  the task we set out to finish proved  a lot more complicated than originally perceived  frankly i worry about the safety of the city of kraghammer  underneath their home down in the bowels of the earth  im dont know how much the council knows  about the race of the illithid  we stumbled into a veritable  hornets nest of them below the city  matt most faces are blank  allura has her hands 
none	 on the table listening intently  as you say illithid you do notice that seeker asum emring  the halfling immediately sits back in his chair  with a look of oh snap  vax i see a lot of blank stares at this table  i wasnt very familiar with them either  there is an entire city in the underdark  beneath kraghammer  and   in their midst was a beholder  that was controlling the entire city  we ended up destroying it  barely escaping with our lives  fleeing the city destroying a 
none	 god i think  vex i dont think we destroyed the god  tiberius the beholder is merely a demidemon  vex yes it was something he had possessed  but the god still lives  liam yes but orcus was behind the beholder  marisha we just have the horn  liam we killed kvarn  and then he got back up again  he didnt get himself back up  keyleth because orcus is a god of necromancy and undeath  orion thats what the horn did  it brought him back to life when he would die 
none	  thats why i ripped it out when we did it  because i knew thats what was going on  thats what the horn does  liam i just worry that its not just an appliance  its got hidden in it something   orion it absolutely has   remember it laughed at me when i tried to crush it   liam is what im saying  matt allura looks at you strangely  allura tiberius you sound different  orion i was talking to   matt i know  vax be that as it 
none	 may we riled up a city of   percy mind flayers  vax buttholes as tiberius would call them   very unhappy race of things  below the surface of the earth  now were here today because tiberius  crafty as he is was able to flee ahead of us  and create a portal back here  we ended up falling ass over tea kettle  in the lyceum so here we are  uriel well welcome back  vax thank you  uriel its glad to see youre safe  vax weve brought a little 
none	 bit of the evil with us  matt at which point the table gets  extremely uncomfortable suddenly  as everyone steps back kima steps forward  shes kept to the back at this point and says  kima its all right  i will speak for this group  as you also know of their exploits and their abilities  they saved me from what was probably  certain death and torture and aided me  in stopping what darkness was beneath kraghammer  at least what we could  but listen to what they have to say  
none	 and understand they are as trustworthy as they come  matt at which point the sovereign  lifts a hand up to her and says  uriel well kima your word is trusted  and i appreciate you also have returned to us healthy  so what is this evil you bring with you  vax we have it stored safely away  keyleth yes  vax but this beholder   was using an artifact a horn  emanating darkness and shit  and tiberius in the heat of the battle  ripped it from its pate  and 
none	 we brought it back with us  keyleth it is one of the two horns of orcus  matt at that notification you say the name orcus  and you can see theres a whole energy shift  in the room at which point  a lot of furrowed brows drop to intense  the actual air of the room seems to go  still for a moment  from what you can see  seeker asum and tofor both  grit their teeth and lean forward as you say this  tofor says  tofor you said orcus  
none	 percy yes  tiberius are you deaf  keyleth tiberius  percy manners  vax we see the apprehension written on your faces  and we are nervous as well  but the alternative was leaving the horn  with these illithid  hundreds if not thousands of illithid  we had to make a judgement call rather quickly and   frankly leaving it there with them seemed  like it wasnt an option  tofor youve done right in bringing it here  this has to be destroyed  sent as far away  if this is indeed 
none	 an artifact of orcus  it cannot exist on this plane  percy plans must be drawn up  keyleth thats kind of what we thought  tiberius yes we knew this already  matt at which point kima steps forward and says  kima now understand this is not something  you can lock in a box or put some guards around it  there was a reason this was forgotten  and needs to be again  with the proper surrounding strength and  formidable individuals  i can take it to the grand chantry in osthania  
none	 where the high paladin archibald will reseal it  far away from the eyes and minds of the world  lest we can come up with some sort of  way to destroy this item  matt at which point the arbiter braum steps forward  arbiter braum if you think theres possibly a way  to destroy this we need to discover this here  we cannot allow it outside of the midst of this  to some chaotic winds and whim of the world around us  we have the walls of emon to keep it safe  
none	 why not take it to the lyceum  vax i want to make an insight check on the whole table  travis dang  taliesin i want to also doublecheck  who was it that handed off the letter to the briarwoods  matt that was the sovereign  taliesin sovereign thank you  matt so which individual the arbiter  liam yeah  matt okay arbiter braum whatd you roll  liam just a ten  matt ten  ashley can i insight the seeker  matt sure  matt whats your insight roll  ashley thirteen  matt 
none	 thirteen okay  taliesin i would like to insight the sovereign  just because reasons  pike yeah we do taliesin one  matt starting the game off strong guys  laura i think you need some florida rolling  taliesin im just an idiot thinking laura i think you need some florida rolling  liam yeah i think so too youre awfully quiet  laura im going to insight check as well  laura because matt can totally whisper to me  if i get this good  liam hell text you  matt ill text it to you 
none	  liam roll high  laura hold on im looking  travis shes rolling  laura seventeen  matt eleventeen  travis seventeen  laura seventeen  matt a total of 17  liam eleventyseven  laura yeah  matt on which individual  liam which person at the table sis  laura you  liam your brother  laura oh no on the deep voiced guy  ashley the arbiter  matt okay arbiter braum  laura yes the arbiter  all laugh  matt okay  marisha you  liam why you gotta be like that huh  
none	 matt ill say in a general feel about the room  but the arbiter specifically  there is definitely a very quick rising in tension fear  and adrenaline in the room at this conversation  fear is the main thing youre getting  i wouldnt say that you sense any deception  you just sense that the stakes have just suddenly jumped  from what they were expecting their morning to be  theyre trying to wrap their head around it  so nothing too particular catches your shit radar  laura all right  grog we are not 
none	 leaving the horn here  vex no  percy we would have to leave you here  matt as grog speaks up for the arbiter he says  arbiter braum im not saying we leave it here  im saying that while we have it here we have it studied  bring it to the lyceum  the headmaster and his entire research facility  could possibly find a way to destroy it  there is no finer arcane focus  than that lyceum in the city  theyre responsible for the construction of our sky ships  and the 
none	 crystals that keep them elevated  tiberius i love skyships  vex i believe the power would be too great  it will corrupt  people will want to take it for themselves  arbiter braum then it has to be taken elsewhere and sealed  like kima was requesting  keyleth so youre saying essentially our two options are  we can either keep it here and study it to try  and figure out a way to destroy it  and have all of the risks of this horn being inside the city  or we take the 
none	 other massive risks of  trying to ship it off somewhere  and hope that it gets sealed away  matt at which point tofor the female dragonborn  sits up in her chair and says  tofor regardless it should not stay here in my opinion  understand the longer it resides within emon  the more word will spread  and more despots will be drawn to our city to claim it  do you wish to have all the darkness of this land  slowly swarm in on the city  vax i think were of a 
none	 like mind  tiberius yes  vax i think we should take it from the city  keyleth i think its a giant target on our backs right now  orion i turn to the arbiter  tiberius there is something that you should know  during our battle with kvarn  which was the name of the beholder  which the horn resided upon its head  when i ripped it from its head  i held it in the telekinesis state  i attempted to crush it for not knowing what it was at first  just knowing 
none	 it was bringing creatures back to life  when i attempted to do so i heard  somewhat of a laughter in the back of my mind  i fear whatever this is attached to might be aware  or if anything more aware than it was previously  im not sure if it was alerted by being placed  on the beholders head to begin with  but i heard something  orion looking at tofor  tiberius i agree with the peasant  that we should get it out of here immediately  matt at which point the 
none	 sovereign  whos been kinda quiet this moment says  uriel well best i can tell at this point  it should not stay in emon  weve had enough trouble in this city  and enough issues here that were having to deal with  in the aftermath of the attack on my family  we do not have the mental will nor the ability  to withstand any sort of assault either from  the inside or the outside of the city  if we are to take it elsewhere  i trust the opinion of you of 
none	 kima and allura  matt at which point allura takes a moment and says  allura just the knowledge of such a thing existing  let alone two in this world is dangerous  who knows what horrors an individual could achieve  should they find both horns  now wherever this gets taken  the knowledge that all of us know that these exist now  and anyone else beyond this means that thats a leak  thats a weakness  now ive heard of some magics  that can erase selective memories permanently  ancient magics  matt 
none	 at which point as she starts saying this  the rest of the room shifts uncomfortably  you can see tofor begins to raise her hand to protest  allura shuts her down and says  allura but id not employ these  unless they were absolutely necessary  i need to speak with the arcana pentsafocal  and see if this is  such a strange and necessary circumstance  to allow the use of such magics  that will take me some time  to get the entire conclave to agree  but i think its possible  
none	 it may be the only way if we can not destroy this  to make sure that the rest of this  world never knows that it existed  i think thats the safest route  as for getting it out of the city  i feel that we have two individuals here  two followers of bahamut  both the deity that saw the deity  brought the vision to kima  and presented whether in a roundabout way  the power and strength of these individuals  to eventually retrieve it  and prevent it from being an 
none	 artifact that  instrumentally destroyed the dwarven city  and quite possibly all of taldorei  so i think if there was a god whose guidance  we can look into  i would put my trust in the clergy of bahamut  matt she looks to kima kima nods her head  tiberius of course wed agree with such sentiments as well  matt kima raises her maul and says  kima well then if thats to be the case  ill send word over to the rest of my temple  well send over our finest paladins  
none	 clerics and guardians  prepare a box for travel well take it across the sea  then we shall seal this bastard  tiberius kima  grog yeah oh sorry  all laugh  tiberius kima when you do approach your king  propose because orcuss horn is pure black evil  perhaps the side of light can help as well  the blessing of sarenrae and other light sources  divine powers could be helpful as well  kima the horn will remain here  until the vessel is brought over  but we have holy vessels specifically designed 
none	 for the  keeping of remains or things that are of great evil  we would gladly welcome the blessing  of something from sarenrae as well  after all there is nothing wrong with more positive energy  instilled to maintain such a negative force  keyleth i personally dont trust this horn  travelling anywhere without at least one of our supervision  matt at which point the sovereign speaks up and says  uriel and to be completely honest  we are very grateful youve brought the horn here  but you are a motley crew  
dung	 who is to say any of you  are also immune to this corruption as well  whos to say you eight  carry the mental willpower to withstand this darkness  any better than a group of paladins designed and trained  their entire lives to withstand and destroy this evil  what assurance do i have that your  attachment to nature will not become some dark  brambled twisted thing in the proximity of this artifact  none  just keep that in mind  orion i look to the group and do this to scanlan  
none	 all laugh  taliesin taking quite advantage of his current state of mind  orion you have no idea what im going to do  for the rest of this game  travis you literally do that to scanlan  like you to scanlan  orion no i was pointing at him  liam right in the ear  matt wet willy to our little gnome bard  orion laughs  matt we miss you sam  matt uriel looks around  uriel well given the circumstance  i would say that our best bet now is to  have 
dung	 kima and tofor reach out to the grand chambers of bahamut  have them bring a vessel and seal it somewhere  that they find fit for an object of this dark presence  is the council in agreement of this  unless some other better means arises  how long will it take for this vessel to arrive  matt at which point kima scratches her chin for a second  kima by the fastest ships  especially if were using some of your fancy sky dinghies  i cant imagine more than two weeks  keyleth two weeks 
none	  matt at which point   tiberius thats 14 days your highness  keyleth sighs  vex that was adorable  pike a fortnight  matt at which point allura stands forward and says  allura its in the means of   keyleth you guys dont have any holy ships here  you dont have like a ship dock  tiberius im sure if they did  they would probably use that one  taliesin but im using it  all laugh  matt at this point allura  sits forward and to the rest of the group 
none	 says  allura to be fair kima in my experience and knowledge  ships function well for the movement  of goods and large objects  the speed of this requires some expediting and  i happen to have a friend who is over in osthania  probably not far from your clergy  perhaps we can facilitate a twoday travel  matt at which point the group leans back  for a second and kima goes  kima well fine yeah i guess  matt shoots a dirty look a little bit to   marisha can i do 
none	 an insight check on allura really quick  matt sure  liam shes saying a ship will be ready in two days  or take two days to travel  matt alluras saying  allura depending on the size of this vessel  why do we even need a ship  we have the ability to transport between the cities  if we can pool our resources  theres no reason why we cant  bring them here nearly instantaneously  marisha thirteen  matt thirteen  best you can tell alluras really hard to read  she keeps up 
none	 her smile  but she definitely has her intense face on  shes deep in the moment  no real gives one way or the other  the rest of the group looks around  and arcanist in the silence goes  allura well then i think that  me and kima and tofor if youd like  we can designate a way of bringing this relic container  as fast as possible so we can get this going  i wish not to keep this within our presence much longer  do we agree to that  tiberius yes 
none	  percy yes  vax i think we would feel comfortable  going along for the ride  and seeing this thing through to the end  matt she glances over to the sovereign  the sovereign nods  uriel very well very well ill allow it  i may have some business for you coming soon  so try not to be gone too long  although this is much more important business i do agree  matt then he gives a laugh and smile  to raise a bit of levity in the room  that nobody seems 
none	 to respond to  uriel but nevertheless  if you wish to travel and see this through  i dont see there would be any complaint  matt he looks to lady kima and kima says  kima no not at all  weve gotten along swimmingly so far  mostly  very well  im bad at this political stuff  matt kima steps back a little bit  kima i defer to the rest of you  matt puts her maul on the ground and awkwardly looks away  the sovereign goes  uriel very well it is 
none	 settled  reach out to your clergy bring the vessel  allura facilitate its arrival  we will get this artifact as far away from emon as possible  this is adjourned  thank you all very much for coming to this council meeting  keyleth okay  taliesin im going to catch the sovereign on his way out  matt all right  at which point everyone gathers the rest of their papers  their parchments theyre rolling up scrolls  the arbiter gets up and lumbers his way out of the room  the seeker asum steps up 
none	 to the rest of you  with a final handshake  seeker asum a pleasure to meet you all once again  ive heard so much youre doing fine work  matt he seems strangely nervous but in a weird way  hes a gentle hint of fanboy  travis oh  laura i wink at him  all laugh  matt he slyly winks back on his way out  matt as he exits tofor stands up  youve only seen her sitting since you arrived  as tofor stands in her female dragonborn form  she is probably 
none	 a good solid foot taller than tiberius  and is a thick musclebound dragonborn paladin of bahamut  her armor shifts as she stands  she begins to make her way towards the door  not even with a glance in your direction  orion that means shes as tall as you grog  travis what  orion shes as tall as you  marisha i just whisper to tiberius and say  keyleth are all the ladies that big in draconia  tiberius it all depends not really  matt shes bigger than usual  tiberius shes a wretched 
town	 peasant so i can not  keyleth thats so mean  vax thats a little harsh  matt allura stands up and begins to leave  the sovereign stands up and as he stands up  the guards come out and they come to his side  percy good sovereign if i can have a moment  did i hear correctly that  lord and lady briarwood were in town  uriel they were but a week ago  percy they were but a week ago  and theyve left have they  uriel yes do you know of lord 
town	 and lady briarwood  percy just in passing  did they have business in town  was there something in particular  im just curious it doesnt really matter  i mean it does matter but not particularly  uriel it was relatively routine were establishing  an official trade route through the northeast  spanning the boreal plane to whitestone  percy oh  uriel they inherited the region after  the unfortunate demise of the derolo family  percy yes  uriel however our ambassador has noted  that theyve rebuilt rather well and honored  the memory 
none	 of the family  and theyre really committed to reestablishing  the foothold of whitestone in the north  so they came here on a diplomatic mission to open trade  percy thats nice  i would love to please keep it quiet  but if i could be notified if theyre coming through again  i would like very much to surprise them  if that would be possible  orion am i standing next to percy  am i hearing this  matt yes  orion good  percy its just old business  it would be very 
none	 interesting to see them again  matt for the sake of this conversation  im going to ask you to roll a deception check  taliesin okay  natural 20  marisha cheers  orion claps  marisha on the new pretty die  taliesin dont fuck with me  matt the sovereign gives you a look and says  uriel certainly  very well i will notify you  should they come through again  percy deeply honored by your thought sir thank you  orion at the end of this conversation im going to  rip off a 
none	 piece of the scroll of telescription  and im going to approach  tiberius when you do all you do is  write the message to this and we will receive it  its an enchanted parchment  i will receive the message  matt he tells you  uriel i know how these work yes thank you  matt as you present it he walks by and  one of his guards takes it from you and gives you a nod  matt they exit the chambers  you guys are escorted out into the main hallway of the 
none	 palace  pike bye matt the rest of the council  matt the rest of the council  scatters amongst the palace proper you are all left  the doors close behind you and the echoing hallways  towards the central left side of the palace  percy sighs  keyleth percy  percy im fine  pike are you okay keyleth youre sweating  percy i know pike are you okay  keyleth why are you sweating  percy its hot  keyleth what happened  percy nothing  the sun comes up and it gets very hot  
none	 ill tell you later  tiberius very good  percy this is discussion for later  theres more important things  matt kima and allura are near you  at which point kima looks at the rest of you and says  kima i apologize i have to figure this out now  so im going to head to the nearest temple of bahamut  and see if we could reach out quickly  keyleth what should we do  kima thats up to you  matt she looks to allura questioning allura  allura in the event of this 
none	  blessed chamber arriving you will be notified  we will request your presence  to bring the artifact in question seal it  and then we will begin our journey over to its place  of hopeful destruction andor proper banishment  pike would you like anyone to go with you  or you just want to go alone  allura to  pike to work out the details of all of this  matt allura says  allura for me its just preparation of  the arcane transference ritual  im going to go meet with a friend 
dung	 of mine  over in ostania  percy i will say we havent replenished our potions yet  and we could go   pike should we go to visit our old friend  keyleth gilmore  percy we could go to gilmores keyleth gilmore  pike gilmore percy we could go to gilmores  pike gilmores glorious goods  keyleth you essentially want us to wait  allura whatever business you need to get done  it should take no more than two days  to get this taken care of  keyleth you guys we have a weekend 
none	  all laugh  liam this is allura and kima who are here  matt yeah theyre the only two who have  stayed behind with you guys outside of the council chambers  liam i take pike by the hand and i walk over to kima  and theyre short so i kneel down  i say to the both of them  vax ive never pretended to be a man of the cloth  i know little of the gods  but the brush we had down below has left me shaken  what can the gods tell 
none	 us  the gods stick their noses into our doings  whenever it pleases them  are they not here  have they anything to say for what is happening now  marisha im with this guy high five vax  matt at which point did you wish to respond in any way  pike well i just know that  i tried to have a response from my god down below  and she didnt really respond the way  i would have liked for her to  but maybe things will be different  what were you going 
none	 to say  matt at which point kima looks to you  at what you just said with curious worry  kima well if what you say is your faith has been shaken  there is always room at the temple of bahamut  to find redemption strength and guidance  you realize the platinum   marisha shes trying to get you to come to her church  matt laughs  pike shes trying to convert  marisha shes trying to convert get the leaflet  kima the platinum dragon has guided  much of civilizations growth expansion and 
none	 survival  for thousands of years  the eternal battle between him and the darkness  that is tiamat and the chaos beyond that   keyleth with all due respect kima  i dont think that was vaxs question  kima to get to the point i apologize  the gods are many and the gods have been  at war for as long as we exist  there are some that believe we are nothing but  the aftermath of their squabbles  but nevertheless there is much good  in this world that guides us to our 
none	 ultimate destiny  and if you yourself ever feel that  you are lost amongst this chaos  dont ever be afraid to stop in  and ask a few questions  vax i was just wondering if i could ask you  to ask them to maybe help  i would never think to ask the gods for help  if i wanted a shiny new sword or pile of riches  but this is something different  grog unless they could get us a pile of riches  vex or a shining sword  vax good boy  
none	 all laugh  matt at which point kima laughs to herself  kima there are benefits to being of the order  matt kima who does not have an accent  and did not say it that way  too many npcs in my head right now she says  kima but understand  whenever i felt lost which was often  its good to have that guiding warmth to turn to  and sometimes it brings you into a subterranean mountain  being tortured by dwarves  sometimes it guides you to new friends and allies  strange the 
none	 way the gods work  but when you put your all into it  theyve kept me alive so far  pike thats a really good point  i guess thats a positive way to look at it  keyleth i really like long walks in the forest  when im feeling disconnected  pike that works too you know  grog lady kima  do the gods allow you to have relationships  matt kima you ask this and she gives you  a look of confusion and then…  she already a darker complexion for a halfling  
none	 but her cheeks grow noticeably ruddier  she averts her gaze and says  kima well  travis i start trying to do my best vax wink  laura im vex  travis vex wink  all laugh  matt she averts her gaze and goes  kima well as far as i know  it is not a vow of chastity within the order  grog so youre saying theres a chance  matt she still is looking away  she looks away and looks to the rest of you  looks to allura looks to you again and 
none	 then goes  kima i really have to get to work on this  taliesin you did this kima i really have to get to work on this  matt she leaves the group and continues down the hallway  quick steps  pike bye kima quick steps  vax a lot of math involved in that equation  keyleth yeah  matt allura chuckles to herself  and steps into the place where she was and goes  tiberius i care not to solve the puzzle  allura oh as a note  be careful who you ask those 
none	 questions to  you may get an earful  matt and allura smiles and motions towards kima  allura dont get me wrong  youre more than welcome to explore as you like  but thats a rabbit hole my friend  grog a rabbit hole  is that what were calling it these days  matt you feel a gentle slap  from some unknown arcane force across your cheek grog  and allura gives you a stern glare  marisha oh dont talk about her girl that way  liam dont make me take my earrings off

none	 series of hanging beads and  large cloth drapes that are gently falling  to be brushed aside as you enter  it’s not as big as you remember or recall seemingly  but as you step through the front door you remember why  much like the tardis  the interior of gilmore’s goods is bigger on the inside  there is a magical enchantment based within this building  where the interior is actually a twostory  and much larger place of business  immediately the smells of incense and  fine perfumes assault your nose   
tavern	 grog ugh fine perfumes assault your nose   matt like a terrible medieval sephora  vax like coming home  ashley medieval sephora  matt a series of magically flickering everburning candles  adorn sconces along the walls  you can see there are glass cases  set out in the center of the room  there is the long wooden bar on the far end  which has itself its own beaded curtain that is closed  and there are three employees of gilmore’s glorious goods in their  ceremonial blue and purple robes that match the exterior 
none	  staring about while there a number of other  possible customers that are looking about  there are numerous bookshelves along the walls  you can see there is  next to the stairway on the far left side of this floor  there is an herbalist who specializes  in dried herbs and sales in that regard  you havent been to the upstairs yet in this complex  but you now are standing back in the comfortable  although slightly offensive to your senses  interior of gilmores glorious goods  liam im scanning the entire store

none	 armaments andor protective items  grog armaments what kind of armaments you got  sherri well if you’ll follow me  matt she leads you up the stairway to the second floor  the second floor itself is just a series of glass cases  that are leaned at an angle  in these cases you can see there are different  items just laid out small labels at the bottom with  grog oh a brief description of the enchantment  matt she leads you across she goes  sherri well first we’ll start here with the ring section 
none	  matt you can see there’s a small case that has  along this purplish velvet pillow  a bunch of different rings set out she goes  sherri we have varying degrees of rings of protection  these rings are designed to protect  the individual who wears  we have one i believe with the basic enchantment  and one with one step higher above that  matt the equivalent of a ring of protection 2  sherri that ring runs 6500 gold  we have a ring of psychic resistance that does  protect yourself from various 
none	 mental intrusions  we have a ring of evasion  that can be utilized three times a day  or one to three times a day  should one of you not be quite quick enough  to avoid any sort of incoming danger  you could allow yourself a successful escape  that runs 4500  we also have a ring of water walking  this one has been popular in the past for  some various traveling troupes that wish to do  various performances that require  defying the surface of water  it gets a bit 
none	 shifty now that i think about it  but you know whatever folks will enjoy  peasantry is easily pleased  so those are our rings at the moment  should any of those tickle your fancy  please do let me know  here   matt and she points over where there is  a thick leather belt with like three straps across  that looks highly well made with  what looks like square runic carvings on the side  sherri this is what is referred to  and this was import from kraghammer  but we’ve 
dung	 had it in here for quite some time  a belt of dwarvenkind  this belt when adorned  does increase the physical heartiness of the individual  as well as giving them  positive interaction with other dwarves  and we haven’t fully tested it yet  but apparently it also seems to resist against  poison intrusion in one’s body  allows you to see better in dark places  and apparently grants you the ability of  speaking reading and writing dwarvish  vex oh wow  keyleth i need that  matt it is 5000 gold 
none	  vex i bet that’s very expensive  liam one month ago you needed that  marisha yeah  pike what was the first ring  grog ring of protection sherri the first ring was the ring of protection  marisha plus two right  matt it gives a plus two bonus to ac and saving throws  marisha that’s really good  pike what was the evasion one  sherri that one that’s the ring of evasion  pike yes what was that  matt it has three charges  and it regains 1d3 charges per day  when

none	 make anyone quicker  matt she goes a second there is a big thick leather tome  sherri this is an ancient tome that was enchanted  many many generations back  upon properly reading and studying this tome  one would increase their physical dexterity permanently  keyleth oh i like that  sherri it only has its abilities and power once a century  so it does come quite pricey  keyleth what is that price  sherri fifteen hundred gold pieces  marisha we should buy that  ashley we should probably buy it  keyleth a 
none	 tome that increases your dexterity plus one  laura it’s on my phone now we switched  matt that’s okay  sherri so there is the manual of quickness of action  we also have the hat of disguise   matt and she produces this like   facetime noises matt and she produces this like   matt she produces this fine brass cap  that has intricate swirling runes on it and what looks like  a small set of ears that are pushed on the sides  so when it fits on the head it looks 
none	 almost like a  smaller head on top of yours she says  sherri this cap when worn however  one can alter their appearance however they see fit  we also have   matt she pulls out this thick leather armor that has a  brownishblue trimmed hue to it and goes  sherri this is what we refer to as coldsnap leather armor  it has an enchantment to improve one’s armor class by two  while wearing it you have resistance to cold damage  keyleth is it leather armor you said  sherri leather armor

dung	 it’s made of dark fur  but as she shakes it you can see these two little  tendrils are on it they like wiggle about  these little spiked edges to the tendrils  sherri this is a cloak of displacement  enchanted and taken from the body of a displacer beast  while wearing it  it makes it so your body projects an illusion  anyone attempting to cause you harm has difficulty  actually finding purchase on your physical form  not knowing where you truly stand  tiberius i will take that cape  sherri 
none	 it is 4500 gold pieces  tiberius wonderful vex  orion oh shit she’s not here  sherri i’ll put this aside as a possibility  we have a pearl of power  matt she pulls up from this small box  she opens up the top lid  sherri this enchanted pearl  you can use it to speak a command word  and regain one expended spell slot  up to third level that you’ve already used  once you’ve used the pearl  it can’t be used until the next dawn  so once per day you

none	 so she presents this dagger to you guys   marisha we don’t want to deplete all of our funds matt so she presents this dagger to you guys   sherri this is a fine dagger marisha we don’t want to deplete all of our funds  sherri this is a fine dagger  the blood runs themselves are enchanted   marisha we also spent a lot on the keep the blood runs themselves are enchanted   don’t forget that we dumped a lot of money into the keep  matt yep you did  marisha so 
none	 we might have more like thirty  matt you guys spent quite a bit on the keep  all right  pike what’s this dagger  sherri this dagger actually can take the lifeforce  from an enemy when delivering a very strong blow  matt essentially on a critical hit on the attack roll   all cheer  ashley we got it all cheer  orion here they are all cheer  marisha how much money do we have  laura we have hold on let me look  travis twentyfour thousand   laura no i normally

none	 as i was saying this dagger  upon a very impactful wound on a foe  steals a bit of its life force  dealing an additional ten necrotic damage  and then gives the wielder ten temporary hitpoints  vex whoa that’s major  sherri so there’s that  we also have an enchanted heavy maul  and we have this is quite a find here  matt as she pulls out this wooden case  she pulls back the wooden top to it as she does  you can see there’s a little bit of ice crystal  
none	 that’s gathered along the interior of the wooden case  there inside sits a short sword  a relatively thick short blade  but the blade itself is like a blue  almost glimmering metal and there’s  actually a rising frozen mist that drifts off the blade  sherri this is an enchanted frostbrand  it acts as a shortsword  whenever it does damage to an enemy  it does an additional 1d6 cold damage  and while you hold the weapon  you have resistance to any fire damage you would take  at freezing temperatures it 
none	 sheds  a ten foot radius of dim light  and when you draw the weapon  you extinguish all magical flames within 30 feet of you  percy fancy  sherri and those are currently  all the things we have at the moment  we’re working on a few more things that will be ready  in the next couple of weeks but those are the  current haul for our abovetheaverage consumer  magical creations  pike i have a question  sherri yes  pike do you have anything that can make armor   quieter
