town	 into so the intrepid group of adventurers known as vox  machina had made their way to the city of whitestone a town that percival here grew up in  and had taken from him and his family five years ago most of his family the de rolos being murdered  in the process the briarwoods who had taken the town rather quickly and covertly held it for five  years had now been building toward some sort of a ritual some sort of event that the party was  investigating they incited a rebellion within the city of whitestone 
none	 gathering the remaining  members to take up arms and fight against this undead scourge that had kept them locked down for  so long oppressed for so long  after managing to take out some of the various operatives under the briarwoods regime they made  their way into castle whitestone itself saved percys sister cassandra thought dead for a long  time got vengeance upon a number of individuals that were on his list except for ripley who got  away fought their way down underneath the city of whitestone fell into an acidbased trap made  their 
dung	 way to the ziggurat this construct beneath the city of whitestone where some ritual was  attempting to be completed by lady delilah briarwood it was discovered that the patron they  spoke of the whispered one had been in previous bits of history spoken as vecna a powerful lich  of ancient history that had attempted to ascend to godhood at some point in the past  they managed to tackle the briarwoods destroy sylas defeat delilah and dragging them back  decided to interrogate in the process of trying to extract information percys dark harbinger  his dark 
none	 passenger if you will who was a tonguewaggling dog for a moment  taliesin i was making an evil shadow  matt i see  taliesin evil shadow  liam kill them all percy kill them all  matt pressured to incite the vengeance that apparently the pact he made with this  entity required upon fighting its will it was jettisoned from his form and the party battled  this deranged greater smoke demonlike entity in the center of this cavern during this fight lady  briarwood tried to escape however found a dagger in the middle of her 
none	 back  thanks to vax over there  laura good job  matt stripped of her possessions and then cassandra dragging her into the nearby acid baths  tossing her body within to leave her story to a definite conclusion scanlan being very astute  apparently in some observations and as convincing as he can be managed to wrestle  percys weapon his list his pepperbox from his grip and tossed it into the very acid pits  destroying his greatest creation and in doing so seemingly breaking whatever hold this shadow demon  had on percys soul  sam 
none	 the way of the gun  travis the quick and the dead  liam a couple weeks in detox and youll be fine  marisha its true  laura it was an intervention percy  sam had to be done  matt upon returning to the city of whitestone they found the rebellion was successful the  undead hordes had fallen to the blades of the surviving rallying warriors of whitestone keeper  yennen who currently was the essentially leader of the rebellion while you guys were going into  the castle met with you you guys were brought to 
town	 the center of town where you began to see the  rest of whitestone emerge the families the children the people that had been too scared to  go outside finally came out to celebrate victory the first real breath of free air theyve had in  five years since the briarwoods took the city  some justice was doled to a few survivors of the briarwoods regime and you were asked to stay  behind to help rebuild and prepare for the coming winters crest festival of which you agreed a  few awkward moments and a few delightful 
none	 bits of interpersonal comedy brought you guys to this  point and now we begin tonights session of critical role so to start off leading up to  this winters crest festival about a twoweek period what would you guys like to individually  do in this time to prepare for the festival  travis we have two weeks  matt yeah essentially the twoweek period were doing a bit of a time jump here so if theres anything  in particular you want to do or attempt in this time period nows the time to do so before we 
none	 get  to the actual event  travis i had a question could i go around lifting up various wagons and maybe ponies  working out to try to increase my strength  laughter  travis or just randomly picking shit up and not have an excuse for it that was good too  marisha i mean the towns in tatters you could be productive and pick things up  travis yeah or you know i pick up a hammer in the morning  laura and youre helping to rebuild  travis yeah  sam like rocky iv  travis 
none	 yeah  matt yeah in a brilliant holiday montage as the cold weather finds its way into the valley of  whitestone grog goes around aiding many of the groups repairing and reassembling the glory of  whitestone finding the structures that are broken or destroyed and trying to clean them prepare for  new building properties you come by eagerly lifting carrying dropping slamming and holding  in place extremely heavy pieces of stone and masonry in some cases putting a few of the local  strong men to shame and some of the local ladies very blushworthy in 
none	 your presence you are very  happy go ahead and make three strength checks for me  travis oh shit three of them thats a 24  matt okay second one  travis thats a 22  matt all right  travis 22 24 22 22  matt through the process of these two weeks not only have you managed to surprise the local  denizens of the city with your feats of strength and masculine physique as when grog is building  grog does so shirtless  travis laughs as anything might as well get a show out of 
none	 it  matt in doing so some of the local denizens pull some cash to the side to thank you for your  efforts you find at the end of the week you are granted a small pouch which contains 315 gold  pieces as a thanks from the locals for all the help both in the rebellion the freeing of  whitestone and for your feats of magnificent musculature  travis i dont feel like i should take this  laura you should take it  travis its a lot of money  laura you should take it  
town	 travis how about you refill my cask of ale instead  sam ooh  liam happy festivus  travis and you give me one gold piece so vex doesnt kill me  matt the crowd look among themselves and one of the lead architects for this whole endeavor nods  to you sounds like a fair trade if youre certain sir  travis im a very stringent businessman do hurry before i change my mind  matt gold piece is in your hand faster than you have a chance to you chip a tooth  travis i dont understand this 
none	 practice it tastes like shit tastes fucking horrible  matt two casks of their precious ale roll up to the base of your foot  travis gasps two  matt two  travis one for each arm eh all right the one that i have im not stopping until its  completely empty bring your goblets and cups its time to get fucked up  matt laughs fantastic all right vex  laura well i got the ring and the bracers that i need to get checked out see what they are  matt and the robe  liam oh 
town	 the robe no i threw it down though  taliesin you picked it up  liam you picked it up  laura i have the robe too  matt okay  laura we left her naked yes we did  matt you kind of did actually  taliesin like properly  matt a few things here actually  travis oh vex i made gold  laura oh wow thank you thats amazing grog where did you find this piece of gold  travis oh i got it for fixing a bunch of shit around town are you going to taste 
none	 it  laura no im not its already got a lot of drool on it actually  travis but how do you know if its gold if you dont taste it  laura im just going to put it in with the rest of the gold grog  travis shit im going to pull one over on her one of these days can you make things look like  theyre gold  sam i can actually  travis you can  sam yes  matt all right  travis ive had my thought for the day theres nothing else  
none	 sam when you have the punchline let me know  travis its a standby tv symbol right now thats all i got  matt so as you take some time first off i want you to go ahead and roll an investigation check  laura aw man ive got to roll for this im going to roll one of my new dice  well its for  matt what was that sound  laura it was exciting 24  matt 24 okay so as you begin pulling out the items and begin separating before you can even  begin the 
none	 initial inspection as you are pulling the robe out you find there is a slight poke  theres something thin  laura singing feel a little poke coming through  matt not that kind of poke you unravel that part of the robe and find theres a long deep pocket on  the inside of the robe and inside theres a long gnarled piece of deep maroon wood that is carved  into a wand shape  sam what kind of a wand  matt im trying to find the actual item card here found it there we go  
none	 sam i want it  laura oh my god  sam i want it  laura oh did you find it did you find it in the group are you even standing near me right now as  im seeing this wand  sam of course i am im always with you  laura how do you know im not doing it in my room  sam are you  laura yes  taliesin whats she wearing right now  sam why i am in your room  laura scanlan get out of here im naked  sam oh i 
none	 know i came in here to tell you to ask you something wheres my wand  laughter  laura ugh ive got to look at this a bit more before i give this to you because it is very very  good it is a wand of fireballs by the way people it has seven charges while holding it  you can use an action to expend one or more of its charges to cast the fireball spell dc of 15 one  charge you cast at third level so many words i dont even understand  liam a fan 
none	 art of this moment please  laura but also  matt you recall actually as you went over the top at the initial battle with lady briarwood  that was what she pulled out and managed to blast all of you with at once when you all were on the  top of the temple  laura nice im just going to put this in my pocket  liam i thought you were naked  laura ill put it in the pocket of the outfit im about to put on and then the ring and the  bracers  matt 
dung	 ill get those right now there you go  laura wait grog dont sit down  taliesin this is why its christmas  sam wheres my ring  marisha whats the ring do  laura oh my god i found so many amazing things you guys  travis those are bracers  laura no  sam those are mine i found them  travis grog will believe whatever you say  laura no im reading them all theyre mine ring of lightning resistance who wants a ring of  lightning resistance  sam sure  laura bracers of defense who 
none	 needs extra defense youre really weak your acs super low  isnt it  liam it is  matt bracers of defense will technically only really benefit anybody whos not wearing armor  liam not wearing armor  matt correct  marisha like grog  matt like monks  laura there you go  liam thank goodness because he is a blushing flower in the wind  matt if you currently have is it an amulet that helps your armor well go through your ac and  find out if it overlaps with any other benefits  travis i do 
none	 have the amulet of armor  matt right so basically that would replace that and you would now have an amulet slot open for any  sort of future enchantment stuff  liam ill take the amulet  matt you could give the amulet to somebody else if you want to  liam hell never give it to me  marisha he was willing to do it until you gave him the idea to not do it  liam thats fine  travis cant remind me of these things  laura okay a robe of shielding shadows can it be 
none	 worn with armor  matt no  laura oh man its just a robe its her dress basically and it gives you resistance to piercing  damage  liam you know what we can do with that sell it  sam or give it to me  laura you have armor dude  sam oh okay  marisha it takes an armor slot  laura and its a womans robe  sam i can make that work  laura yeah you totally could  marisha can we take the fabric and sew it into a nice afghan or something  
none	 matt you can certainly try it would probably ruin the enchantment  laura oh it would ruin the enchantment if you sew it differently  marisha what if you dont cut into it  laura what if we fold it  taliesin what if we just tie the dress around our neck  laura maybe just put your arms through it and then let it ride behind you like a cape  marisha right its like one of those wear nine different ways dresses  matt you can wear it however you want and you will discover one way or 
none	 another if it actually  gives an effect  laura well im just going to pocket this because we may sell it how about that and then a ring  of lightning resistance anybody want it how many rings can we wear at one time  matt two one on each hand  taliesin i would not say no to a ring of lightning resistance  laura pass that over to percy  taliesin ive got plans at the moment its the only way to charge my glove  laura all right and this wand of fireballs i feel like 
none	 scanlan needs it more than anyone else  sam i already have a wand that shoots things  liam youre the only one who can use it  sam oh im the only one who can use it ill take it then  laura i might just sell this robe though  travis i know how you work it its swish and flick fireball  laura swish and flick  matt what could possibly go wrong  travis what if a nonspellcaster uses a wand nothing right  laura no anyone can use it  travis should we try it 
town	  liam yes you should try it  travis i am a walking crash test dummy i mean we can try it itll be fine  matt thats my favorite mindset  laura and then im going to mostly for the rest of the time keep to myself and trinket and im  going to help the townspeople rebuild a bit  matt all right wondrous vax  liam i am also going to keep to myself and im going to talk to the people in town see what  businesses are open or trying to open see what they 
none	 need and i would like to talk to percy  since i dont know anyone here about who i could talk to about getting messages to emon and i  would like to get a message to gilmore to see if he can fill any need here if trade is so ruined  here that gilmore could be a help and gilmore gets another front a place to do business and  actually do good in a place that needs it  marisha gilmores glorious books  sam thats right  laura i like it  matt over bits of 
town	 a period of discussion for the most part any sort of nonofficial courier  service has been negated in the town however there is now a glut of people that are after the  devastation especially the ensuing rebellion folks that need work and need coin and there are  many individuals that would be more than willing to for a handful of gold coins make the journey  to emon delivering any messages you like  liam well i will write a message to gilly and say that theyre hurting here they need trade all the  supplies that 
town	 hes able to supply and tell him that this town is about to explode and is  definitely a good place for his wares  laura are you going to break up with him in the letter too are you going to tell him that youre  going to break his heart as soon as he writes you back is that whats going to happen im sorry  im just looking at your letter as youre writing it  liam no because ive been avoiding her as well im avoiding everybody except for percival who  ive been asking advice 
none	 from  matt okay do you also have the cloak did you take the cloak  liam i have the cloak yeah yeah dibs on that  matt fine pickings off the corpses of the two major villains of the previous arc  liam yes  taliesin more corpse picking to do  matt exactly  laura what you have so many cloaks though why do you need another one  sam hes opening a cloak factory  taliesin gilmores glorious cloaks  matt cloak hoarding over here all right scanlan  sam i wanted to do four things  
town	 travis yeah  sam one compose an epic poem to commemorate the rebels rising up against the empire that had kept  them down for so long sort of a force that had awakened i call it  resident evil  i dont know why  because theyre residents and there was evil i couldnt come up with another name for it  theyre residents of the town and there was an evil thats all so im looking for a  publisher  matt okay good there may be a grand opportunity at the winters crest festival to perform this 
town	  sam oh gulp  liam disney and capcom will be calling  sam i also wanted to make sure that we were using the treasury coordinating with percy to open a  library for the people to help them rebuild their place which sounds like vax is already on i also  commissioned a portrait of myself i dont know if you i found a young artisan in town that i paid  him some coin to paint me something that could possibly hang in the keep at greyskull in the  dining room  matt okay after asking 
town	 around for a few days you manage to discover there is a budding local  artist who doesnt really believe in his artwork he currently works in the stables on the far  southwest side of town but people have seen some of his work and tried to bolster him so youre  sent in his direction and as you get there you can see him hes currently in the process of  actually cutting through one of his recent works he wasnt happy with and hes violently tearing  through it as you step into the stable he stops 
dung	 and puts it off to the side  sorry sir can i help you  sam ah hello my name is scanlan shorthalt i was the leader of the rebellion that just defeated  lord and lady briarwood  matt oh the pleasure is mine he is now averting his gaze and almost bowing his head like  youre royalty hes very flustered and flushed by the sudden appearance  sam i hear you are a budding artist and i am if nothing else a supporter of the arts  matt my talents are far unrefined and nowhere near powerful 
town	 or  decent enough for your attentions  sam well i believe in you and i need you for a very important commission a great good has been  done here by the rebels by the townspeople with the help of vox machina and of course with the  help of vox machinas leader myself therefore im here to commission a humble portrait of  myself you may not know him but there was a folk hero in my town growing up his name was fabio he  would frequently pose with windblown hair and an open shirt on a 
dung	 horse i was thinking something  like that and also i have this figure of pike shes a friend of mine id like her on the back  of the horse arms around my waist looking super hot if thats possible  matt make a persuasion check only because hes so down on his own skills  sam 33  laughter  matt as youre telling this tale he goes from bashful and meek to staring off in the distance  the artistic inspiration rolling through his head  sam oh sorry 31 i was wrong  matt unchanged he 
none	 begins finishing your sentences as youre describing scenery and  extrapolating on it you can see the artistic mind is definitely spinning he looks to you and goes  it would be my honor please he reaches forward and takes your gnomish hand and you know youre  about two and a half feet shorter than him but hes still very humble kneels down and says  i would be honored to do this portrait  no charge  sam please i insist i must give you something for your troubles  matt whatever you deem fit sir gnome but 
none	 i  sam whats your name young sir  matt jameson  sam jameson  liam i like him  sam i like this guy  travis i think everybody does until they dont  sam how about in return i will sing your praises far and wide as the greatest artist in where are  we whitestone whiteheart briarstone heartwood  matt in making that mention his openness suddenly closes off and he withdraws you see this  fear in his eyes and he shakes his head that would be untrue and i am but a simple stablehand  
none	 i can do this for you but please if you could keep this between us  sam all right im aware that some people like to be discreet about things and thats all right with  me too then ill pay you the going rate for portraits of me  matt certainly how large would you like it  sam how big is the wall at greystone keep  matt depends on which area  sam the dining room wall  travis laughing thats like sistine chapel  matt your dining areas probably about 12 to 15 feet high  
none	 sam high okay and wide  matt wide id say off the top of my head somewhere between 40 and 50 feet  sam well id like to leave room for other artwork as well well say 20 by six  travis and marisha laughing 20 by six  sam well its half and half 20 wide six high  matt his eyes go wide and he nods and says this is a challenge but i believe i do know someone  whom i can order such a grand canvas from this can be done this can be done and 
none	 you see he  smiles and takes your hand once again this can be done  sam thank you sir jameson was it  matt jameson yes  sam you have done a noble deed for your people and for the rebel forces  matt eclipsed by the deeds you have done sir gnome  sam oh that is true  laughter  matt he rushes off to prepare himself  sam and then one last thing on a serious note i do some research to see if me or any one of my  party could over time and 
none	 with great effort learn the skills required to utilize a  teleportation circle  matt okay go ahead and make an arcana check  sam not great arcana 11  matt yeah what little you know of teleportationbased magics which is not your  forte in your bardic experiences but what youve heard and what youve seen while youve traveled  with tiberius and youve come across other individuals that used the arcane spells that  caused transport teleportation circles themselves are a very specific ritual its a spell that  comes from within the arcane casters capabilities if you 
none	 yourself do not have that youre not going  to be able to utilize it at a drop of a hat  after asking around you find there once was a teleportation destination circle in castle  whitestone that was part of the network of taldorei in emon but has since been destroyed  and sundered and has been for quite some time you imagine probably when the briarwoods came it was  deemed a dangerous little loose thread so over the period of the next week or so best you can  ascertain is that type of transportation here 
town	 is going to be probably not likely at least not with  the resources you have at your disposal you may have to travel elsewhere  sam its not a skill i can learn  matt its a spell you could learn but that would be something you would have to swap out as you  level up or choose as your spell progression down the road  sam all right  liam i find its better to travel the world rather than use fast travel  laura i agree you see so much more of it  liam you 
none	 miss everything  laura yeah  marisha all the artistic  liam every nook and cranny yeah  matt but you do as part of your groups discussions throughout the week discover that  keyleth does have longtransport capabilities  sam ooh hello keyleth fly the friendly skies  matt you want to explain what you can do  marisha i have teleport via plants so i can bamf through the sun tree we can all  sam we can all  marisha we can all  liam you mean like a big plant  matt it opens for six 
none	 seconds a portal  marisha for one round i can be like this tree is a portal and we walk through the tree and it  goes to another tree as long as i know of that trees existence  laura and its the same size right it has to be something of the same size  or it can be any tree  marisha it has to be walkable bodysize  matt a large or larger tree as far as this size  laura trinket and grogsized trees  sam that sounds like it would be the quickest root 
none	 to go  taliesin groans  liam is there a tree in your garden back at greyskull  marisha there is i made sure there was a nice  laura big old fatty tree  marisha big old fatty oak tree  matt theres actually two large trees i believe in the sarenrae temple  laura i forgot to say what else i wanted to do  matt what else do you want to do  laura well because of that flying potion i wanted to try to do some research and see how much  flying potions are if 
none	 theres any kind of items that can make you fly whenever you want  travis she liked it  laura i really liked it  matt laughs the first taste is free  laura i know i mean i know the carpets gone but maybe theres like an individual sort of item  thats less expensive than a flying carpet i dont know just wondering  matt you still have the flying potion  laura i downed it  matt right the card i gave you for it because that would contain  the cost of that particular one  
town	 laura oh  travis 5250  liam you have a robe  laura well but i want a bunch of them though  matt which you can have made or possibly look about to have purchased this town is pretty thin  as far as  laura magic stuff  matt yeah most of anything of worth of an arcane nature was confiscated and utilized or  essentially melted down for its residuum components as part of the creation of the  ziggurat in preparation for their ritual so other than the items you were given when you first  
town	 arrived here youre hardpressed to find anything in this town of that type but asking around  there are enchantments that can gift flight but theyre pretty rare  laura okay  liam talk to gilmore  matt gilmore would be the person to talk to about that you good scanlan  sam oh im good  matt all right keyleth  marisha well keyleth is very confused as to why everyone seems to be avoiding each other its  odd everyones so standoffish anyway keyleth is going to go help the farmers and try and maybe  help revitalize 
town	 some of the land and help with planting crops and helping out there she also  wants to make sure all the local kids are taken care of any kids that lost their parents in the  rebellion lead the charge of making sure the kids are taken care of  matt okay going around there were a number of casualties in the town as part of the rebellion  it unfortunately happens in warfare regardless of how noble a cause it may be there are a few  families that were left fatherless or motherless as there was quite 
none	 a share of the sexes raising up  for this battle so the children that no one that you know of lost both parents for the most  part there was the intent that if there were a parental unit that at least one had to stay in  case of such an occurrence to raise the children but you go out and meet with some of the families  and make sure theyre taken care of  some of the homes that were destroyed as part of the rebellion you and grog both worked together  to help make 
none	 sure the process of rebuilding goes well you do also help the farmers begin to right  their crops and revitalize the land which had been drained by the necromantic essence of the  briarwoods presence and whatever the ziggurat was pulling from the land itself beneath seems to  have released its hold on the immediate vicinity so through your aid specifically being a druid  of your nature you prepare this for probably one of the finest harvests that whitestone has had in  quite a long time even though it is deep winter theyre already seeing early 
none	 spring growth through  your aid  marisha dope climate change  matt i know its crazy vegetation and vegetables that are withstanding and still able to  grow through the frost in the mornings as the cold weather is coming from the winter so youre  raising quite a strong crop well done  marisha well have thanksgiving in about nine months  matt laughs there you go  taliesin for the orphans man  marisha for the orphans  matt percival  taliesin okay im going to spend most of my time organizing the affairs of the castle 
none	 and the local  government and making sure that theres institutions in place getting rid of anybody who  might still have sympathies towards the briarwoods helping reestablish the  zenith and the ladies chamber spending some time with my sister  matt on that note before you continue there is no current institution in place anyone of any  political power outside of archibald you and cassandra has been slaughtered long past so in  these discussions you talk with keeper yennen you talk to cassandra and there is an air of  understanding that right now there is 
town	 this period of peace this period of calm but there has to  eventually be an establishment put into place some sort of political head to oversee the  rebuilding of the city and the continued growth and survival of this town proper  cassandra confides in you multiple times that she is nervous that she especially given recent  circumstances her recovery of her stockholm syndrome with the briarwoods is not confident  that she would be able to lead on her own there is a moment where she apologizes extensively to  archibald archibald who did survive and 
none	 was her direct contact in the castle takes a few days  before he will even face cassandra when he is told that she essentially had been leading him astray  and spearheading the death of the previous rebellion you also discover the reason the  various new nobles that were prepared for your ambushes were because cassandra had gotten  information about that from archibald and then fed it to the briarwoods but you do sense a very  very deepseated regret and an urge to make amends for that from her and because of that  circumstance she 
none	 doesnt feel like the people of whitestone who would have this information which  you havent told anyone there is no largescale announcement the only people that know about  cassandras current situation with the briarwoods are you guys keeper yennen and archibald  sam archibalds still around  matt he is  sam and he betrayed us  laura and marisha no  laura cassandra betrayed him  liam cassandra played everybody  sam oh all right ill let him live  laura thank you glorious leader thank you  sam just part of the team guys  matt 
none	 so that is an ongoing discussion as far as establishing the structure theres been many  talks but nothing has been finetuned and that may play itself out as part of the festival  taliesin i have two items that i would like to look at well i have three items that i would  like to look at sylass sword and his amulet  matt okay the brooch that he left behind  taliesin brooch  matt travis has got you  taliesin really travis  laura hes our runner  liam oh ho ho ho and all of 
town	 that  laura what is it  marisha what is it what is it  taliesin damn  laura is it amazing  liam hes standing there like guile before a street fighter match  matt he hasnt heard of that character  laura laughs what is it what do you have  taliesin i dont know its a piece of paper its pretty cool its called a brooch of living  essence and it basically masks the wearers alignment essence whether theyre good or evil  they cant be seen by detect magic spells  liam that is the 
none	 worst thing for you  laura not anymore  taliesin is it  liam im unsure its hard to tell  matt you gather that this item in particular was used by sylas to travel through magically  protected areas without giving up his undead essence or being read for his true intentions  marisha its for a shifty bastard its definitely a shifty bastard thing  laura its for scanlan  sam oh me my alignments good  marisha yeah but it could be good if you want to pretend to be evil  taliesin either this or vax 
none	 this would be an interesting thing for either  marisha it doesnt protect you against detect magic spells it protects you against detect good  or evil spells and magic spells that reveal your true nature  sam true nature  liam it would be a good thing  laura so you could pretend to be bad  taliesin what do you have in your brooch  liam my brooch  matt its in the neck slot  liam nothing  taliesin nothing in your neck slot  laura that sounds so disgusting  liam my neck slot laughs i 
none	 dont know percy what have i got in my neck slot  matt you see the brooch slowly press deep in his neck slot laughs god ugh dont turn that into  any fan fiction please  taliesin dont say that  matt i know percy what else  taliesin the sword  matt the sword  sam that is a big piece of paper  liam thats a rather big piece of paper for a sword  taliesin and ripleys gun  matt well first as you take the sword in your hands the large thick obsidian onyx black 
none	 blade  you take a while to not necessarily attune to it but put enough of your attention towards it where  you sense its magical capabilities as it begins to clarify where one voice before was not there a  new voice speaks and says  marisha wait  liam shushing noises this is important  taliesin goddamn it  matt you are you my new wielder  laura what  sam hes got a talking sword  marisha whats with you and fucking weapons man  taliesin whimpers  laura be strong percy  liam youre not here 
none	  taliesin no  laughter  matt then leave me until one worthy lifts this blade  taliesin im going to gently put it down  matt okay  marisha this is a sword that has a name  taliesin i dont know what to do about this laughs this is really disturbing  matt as you step away from the blade you can feel the air nearby is generally colder in its  presence and where previously it was just a weapon you can almost feel like theres something  looking at you theres a presence just bent towards 
none	 you expectantly  laura thats creepy  taliesin whimpers  sam just try it out what could go wrong  liam do you want to become evil grog  travis i can tame it  taliesin laughs wow  liam dont do it percy  travis what does it say  laura and sam what does it say  taliesin i dont think i should tell any of you  matt the blade sits there on the ground where you leave it whatever you wish to do with it  travis do you want to put it in the bag 
none	  taliesin god youve given me so much to think about its really unfortunate im definitely  going to take at least a week of our two weeks to think about the sword  matt okay what are you going to do with it in the meantime  liam sleep on top of it  taliesin sleep on top of it its in my room  travis you dont want it in the bag  taliesin no  matt so for each evening as you lay down to sleep you can feel a voice creep back in to say  
none	 the voice is inquisitive im useless left here i seek the thrill of battle im hungry other  evenings it comes to you almost pleading why have you forsaken me you took me as a trophy  what purpose has a blade that goes unused i will remember this  then it falls silent after a few days  travis the silent treatment  laura its sulking  taliesin is it a twohanded sword or a onehanded sword  matt its a greatsword its twohanded big old final fantasy 7 sword  taliesin goddamn it  sam evil grog is 
none	 not a good idea  marisha this is the thing thats fucked up  taliesin yeah i know which is why i shouldnt have given him that brooch goddamn it i may ask  for that brooch back  liam you can certainly try  taliesin god damn it  travis laughs whoa  matt so as you think on it the weeks pass  taliesin no i had a  matt oh what did you guys want to do  taliesin i also wanted to work on ripleys gun  matt right the gun itself is essentially a baseline 
none	 pistol if you look in your archetype for  your fighter class of gunslinger the pistol mechanics all apply to that weapon beyond that  nothing in particular its just her first successful attempt in recreating a firearm  taliesin okay im going to start making some ammo for it and im going to work on it  matt okay  laura percy whenever you get a chance could you maybe how hard are those exploding arrows to  make superduper hard  taliesin not terribly difficult i dont think its in two weeks but when we go home ill 
none	 work  on it i know i like them too i hate you youre a terrible person  matt you picked up the sword man  travis percy hows that sword working out  taliesin its a little big actually  travis is it look i have this onehanded dragonslayer longsword if you want to get used to  a bit of badassery before you move up to the big leagues i know youve got that dinky piece of  shit youve been using this whole time  matt just as a note too a greatsword is a strengthbased melee 
none	 weapon dex does not play  into it  taliesin oh which is well yeah  matt based on whatever your strength is whats your strength percy  taliesin strength is 12  matt you would probably not do very well with that  taliesin which is why i was thinking about having it cut down and melted down into something more  useful  matt this is also viable if you wanted to try  travis whispering dragonslayer longsword  taliesin you know this is actually pretty badass if i did give it to grog yeah  travis trade 
none	  marisha jesus christ and hes not even going to say anything about it youre a terrible person  not matt you are he gave you the device and you used it  liam youve been playing dd for years you know what this means  taliesin im going to let you know we should keep an eye on him just in case  matt so grog as you take up the blade in your hands you hear coming out of the ether a gentle  low velvet voice caresses the inside of your head saying you are you to 
none	 be my wielder  travis what the shit  matt speak your name warrior  travis grog  matt warrior grog have you taken up the blade of craven edge  travis is that what this is do you have a female setting  laughter  matt you hear a long drawnout sigh do you accept my power  travis theres a power that comes with you what kind of power  matt do you enjoy drinking the strength of your foes watching them beaten before you and have  that very power become your own  travis sounds pretty 
none	 good  matt do you wish the shadows to encase your form and grant you resilience and anger forcing those  to kneel before you in fear  travis the shadows  matt do you accept grog  travis fuck yeah  laughter  matt then it is done together we will accomplish great things  travis do you have a name do i call upon you can i call you bacon  matt you call me bacon and this blade will cut the very hand you hold my name is craven edge it  will do you well to 
none	 remember that  travis right yep was totally kidding about the bacon craven edge well im excited about this  partnership clearly we will be a force to be reckoned with by the way  can other people hear you  matt silence  travis shit  liam he will kill me first  taliesin it is an amazing sword  travis i havent even read it yet  taliesin you havent read it yet  travis no i cant read  laughter  laura i want to read it so bad  liam dont let anybody read it  
none	 taliesin its so magical  travis give me a bear cookie  matt you have a clue as to what it can do based on when it was used against you by sylas  travis yeah it was badass thank you  matt so anything else you want to accomplish before we close out on the rest of the week  sam i had a question  matt yes  sam did we assemble a team of magic  laura to take care of the thingy  marisha yeah that we needed to we all need to take care of 
none	 that  laura the marble of death  matt so throughout the week keeper yennen a few of the lowlevel arcanists that exist here  laura didnt we send for eskil ryndarien  matt you sent for him but you know information right now travels at the speed  of whatever it is you  marisha by mule  matt yeah  taliesin at speed of mule  matt the speed of that as it continues forward you get word back nothing from allura vysoren  yet eskil does respond saying he is currently finishing up some personal business but 
none	 will make  his way towards whitestone within a couple weeks with some of his compatriots who may also  be of aid information has been gotten across but it wont be until probably after this festival for  them to begin their investigation  however in the meantime keeper yennen and a few of the smaller local arcanists do make a couple  trips down to inspect the ziggurat themselves when they return yennen is at a loss most of  them dont quite understand the nature of the magic there it seems to be immobile it seems to 
none	  be completely either negating consuming or preventing any sort of magical force within a  specific radius of it a lot of their normal arcane methods of inspecting or divine methods of  inspecting this site are not functional this is more like bring old tomes and research historical  records of things that may be similar to this so when you bring up that you had reached out to  eskil ryndarien with the information you had you gather that will probably be a much more fruitful  endeavor as of right now no one has any clue 
none	 what this is  laura and we searched the briarwoods library that they had gathered together that say anything  about  matt yeah  laura okay  matt some of the information you acquired from scanlans memory and a little bit of research into  vecna very little information really exists but as the keeper of secrets you get the sense that  most anything of importance in dealing with this ritual has been destroyed as part of its  preparation because secrets are meant to be kept and hoarded so not much luck in that regard  unfortunately 
none	 however as the second week draws to a close the winters crest day comes forward  as the morning crests into the proper winters crest festival you all awaken in castle  whitestone to an unusually cold morning as you look out there is a fresh dusting of white snow  that has gently caressed the entirety of this valley and the entire city itself you all get  yourselves ready gather your belongings and preparing for the festival youve been helping get  ready this entire week you walk down towards whitestone itself  as you get to the 
town	 outskirts of the city you can already hear in the distance music beginning to  play blue and white ribbons are hung up all throughout the town on the outside of buildings  outside of taverns outside of even the remaining wreckage that is only partially built it seems  that overnight people just went through the town and decorated whatever needed to be decorated to wipe  clean the memory of the recent trials and difficulty that everyones undergone  you begin to make your way towards the center of the town to the town square where the sun 
town	 tree  is and as you approach you now see the source of the music as a number of individuals in the town  have brought out their instruments theyre playing some more discordant than others but  overall a sense of joy as people for the first time in a long time are truly embracing this  positive atmosphere you see children laughing and running through the streets you can smell  freshcooked pies and various bakery items just filling the air around you looking over as you  approach the sun tree you can see where once bodies 
none	 hung from its boughs there now are strings  of blue and white ribbons that are intertwined with each other braided and set across from  branch to branch you can see fine little glass structures that have been hand blown and left to  drape from them to be part of the festivities  as you begin to make your way up there immediately people begin to notice your presence  and you can see people in the streets begin to gather up and begin cheering you hear voices  mutter out vox machina people start reaching out and 
none	 shaking your hands thank you so much  thank you youre taken aback by the attention its reminding you a little bit of the awkwardness  you had with the last winters crest in emon  laura be on the lookout for eggs giant frostylooking eggs  matt you make your way towards the sun tree and there you see keeper yennen is in the process of  speaking with a few of the people that helped him with this entire rebellion in setting up this  event and he greets you all as you approach oh my friends how 
tavern	 wondrous glad to see you are all  wakened and ready and well rested i assume  travis yes  matt glorious well this is a day of celebration weve taken the time and mourning  shall continue as needed but today today is to embrace what it means to be alive to thwart the  darkness and the evils that press upon the free folk of these lands and of course to eat and  drink until you are full and drunk  laughter  marisha cheers to that  matt it will be a little bit before we 
none	 get to the actual celebration speech but in the meantime go  free yourselves drink be merry there are a few events going on around you and he points in a  few directions and you can see around you there are tables set up there are individuals playing  games immediately to the left you can see there are two long tables set up and a stack of pies off  to one side looks like an eating contest  travis i havent eaten for a full day  marisha in preparation  travis yep  matt you do 
none	 see what looks to be a gentleman with a high box with a very very fine waxed mustache  that is currently doing parlor tricks and magical presentations for people who are trading coin to  be astounded with his illusions you can see what looks to be a series of tables behind the sun tree  heading towards the southeast side of it you recognize better than anyone these are central  tables relatively small with a chair on each side  travis arm wrestling  laughter  travis craven i think oh wait thats arm wrestling go to

none	 like it  hasnt seen some use in a while the gentleman sitting there with longish hair parted in the  center and combs outward hes got a waxed mustache hes wearing dusty presentational  robes and he has on the top of it a series of small boxes and what looks like various tricks he  has at the ready there are three children off to the side with either their keeper or parents  behind now watch if you will as this simple ball transports itself between the cups and yet  find your eyes unable to follow 
none	 and he switches the cups around for a moment whoosh  laughter  matt where is the ball little one the kids deliberate and one goes that one  are you sure they all shake their head  oh im sorry the ball has escaped your vision once again  and they all they cheer he lifts the other one  marisha gasps are you a wizard weve met a few wizards no are you a sorcerer because you  dont look like a druid this doesnt look like natural magic what  matt i am what you refer to

none	 each other they bring out  their own 25 gold pieces and they plop it into the pot hes entering as our proxy he looks  around yes what they said she gives a nod well i dont see why not i suppose all right  other people end up gathering up their change and she goes over the sheet with one of her  compatriots and they end up breaking off into teams there are four tables set up and for this  round at least this part of the festival they break up in different parts she calls 
none	 out to one  table all right we have a jasper leer to go against a scanlan shorthalt at this table  sam thats me  travis yay scanlan  marisha yes scanlan  matt as youre getting ready you see a farmertype individual clean as dressed as he  could be in relatively ragged clothes but he looks like hes trying to be presentory for the  festival grey beard longish shoulderlength tousled hair he walks up pulling his wrist back  and hes got some good muscles looks like hes definitely been working a lot of heavy farmwork 
none	  for most of his life he sits down at the table across from you gives you a look over  well shall we begin  sam sure can i eversocovertly say to him you dont want to beat a gnome you dont want to  beat a gnome im casting suggestion on him  matt i will say go ahead and make a sleightofhand check  sam oh the worst shit 13  laura what does it mean the eyebrows  travis and the phone came out  sam who knows well find out when my arm gets wrenched

none	  you hands together and prove your strength now go ahead and make a strength check  sam 19  marisha laughs oh shit  matt you guys stand there for a second groans his arm begins to push on yours begins to bend  back a little bit you reflex with might and begin to set him back up to the center youve  reached a standstill once again back at the center his expression on his face looks  frustrated and surprised  sam you werent expecting this were you pants neither was i  matt make another

town	 a moment to relax she goes up against another merchant of the town and just  destroys him the next bout is a man who the way hes dressed appears to be a blacksmith he still  has his leather gauntlets on he takes them off at the table takes off his leather apron and sets it  to the side gets down and ready and looks around for his opponent and the two guards bring up the  chained vedmeyer who then sits down at the table the chains hitting against the sides of the wooden  table top 
tavern	 and coasting to the ground as they adjust he puts his arm on the table with a thud  and has to bend over to even reach the other guys grasp you can see the look on his face  immediately pale as he realizes who hes up against its two rounds and maybe 20 seconds tops  before vedmeyer slams him so hard you can part of the tabletop splinters inward and the guy brings  his hand back with bleeding knuckles he reaches over puts his hand out expectantly the barmaid  hands him a tankard full of 
town	 ale he downs it in one gulp slams it on on the table and stands back  up again he glances over at you and steps back into the crowd the second round of the events go  in you are paired up with the gentleman who defeated scanlan  marisha kick his ass grog  taliesin yeah  sam put him in a body bag  travis i sit down and i say i feel really bad for you mate you know my friend hes got hand  herpes so do i  sam its true  matt make

none	 knuckles are immediately up against  the wood you can see fear in his eyes and hes gripping but hes also trying to move his fingers  to make sure he doesnt make too much contact with your hand  go ahead and roll another strength check  travis 11  matt at which point he sees the grin on your face and gets his will back behind him and  grunts forces you back to the center make another strength check  travis oh shit seven  matt natural 20  laura oh no  matt he groans slams 
none	 you right over on the edge of the table make another check  marisha come on grog  travis 23  matt 19 back up to the center at a standstill you see now the veins bulging at his neck you can  see now his face is turning red from the strain hes breathing heavily pants as he pushes again  make another strength check  laura come on grog  travis eight  matt chuckles eight groans keeping you right in the middle make another check  sam i hold up my hand and i use minor illusion

town	 and whack slam it really  hard on the wood you can see he pulls away gasps wash it wash it please wash it  somebody wash it  travis you know the cure for that is actually on my man vaxs groin its very magical  matt he slowly backs into the crowd looking very disturbed and disgusted as everyone else is  cheering for you a tankard is slammed before you filled with ale  drink up youve earned it champion  travis i look at gonad over at the side i drink it chug it down and 
none	 hold up the finger at the  same time  matt laughs he sits there and tenses for a second with a grin as he growls his cold breath in the cold  winters crest air dissipates up above him and he gives you a nod the slow look of warrior  intensity but respect you can see hes looking forward to hopefully this as much as you are but  he still has a battle to do himself  liam ive spent the last ten minutes while hes kicking that guys ass to find a soldier or  somebody 
town	 in the crowd to bet  sam a young boy  liam im not you  laughter  liam 200 gold on grog somebody in the crowd  matt make a persuasion check  taliesin all right  liam 14  matt going around youre hardpressed to find somebody who at this moment in time is interested  in betting any money against the goliath that helped save the city you find one gentleman who  seems a little interested and he gives you this sidelong sleazy grin tell you what not 200  gold but ill put 50 down 
none	  liam thats not worth it 75 gold  matt step away halfie  laura oh i heard it i give him the evil eye  matt hes too focused on the current bout at hand at this table you can now see vedmeyer and  the woman guard sits down someones like oh trishas wrestling  travis her names trisha trish the dish  matt vedmeyer again with his chains against the wood as he sits down with a smile he gives her a  grin and nod shes just intensity towards him the whole time you can see

town	 tracks we have been able to present to  you over the next 20 minutes the story of vox machina the beginning so enjoy guys well see  you here in a moment  travis yeah  matt the grandest of adventures often stem from humble beginnings the story of vox machina is one  such a tale they begin as a ragtag group of mercenaries in the swamp town of stillben eking  out a living when a job board posting brings them to fendril vas the wealthy head of a small  merchant empire  hired to investigate 
town	 new competition in town called the myriad the path eventually leads them  into a chamber housing a planar rift pulling the group into the plane of the stillborn god  crysathul it is revealed that the contract was a ruse to feed the party to the undead fetal deity  upon destroying the abomination the party returns to repay fendrils deceit  with a blade to the throat  laura weeks pass and grog the barbarian hasnt been seen since suddenly leaving for the city of  westruun heading there in search of him the party meets his childhood 
none	 friend and their new  companion the gnome cleric pike grog apparently hasnt been acting normally and had marched off  on his own through the bramblewood towards the ominous mountain gatshadow the party followed  dispensing with a troop of roadside thieves along the way and wound their way toward the mountain  deep within they encountered an abandoned subterranean city and eventually a crypt housing a  mindcontrolled grog the reanimated corpse of his father strongjaw and a dying mage attempting a  ritual to lichdom our heroes slayed the mage but not before he could complete the 
town	 ritual and embed  his phylactery into grogs chest  returning to town in search of aid they find there are few of enough knowledge or power to  ascertain the nature of grogs wound also rumors of missing children begin to reach the partys  ears while contemplating all this at a local inn the party is approached by a mysterious elf named  drez vina who wishes to pay handsomely for the party to infiltrate an archmages tower and  retrieve a particular brass box within  pushing forward in the hopes of speaking with this archmage the 
none	 party accepts and passes through  arcane trap after trap to reach the top of the tower deciding not to steal from the archmage but  instead parley with him for his aid the towers keeper realmseer eskil ryndarien agrees to help  and sends the party to collect two items he requires for the ritual the skull of a nightmare  and the heart of a nymph the caveat their defeated foe is indeed a lich now and in merely  two weeks he will be reborn within grog  they travel north to the umbra hills wrestle with 
none	 a small cult to slay their infernal messenger and  his nightmare steed and find a fresh companion in percy newly freed from imprisonment from there  the party rushes south to the frostweald a forest shrouded in eternal winter battling past  basilisks the party finds a single unfrozen pool where they coax a nymph from her dimensional  sanctuary talking their way out of battle grog enters the sanctuary with the nymph and returns  holding a jewel gifted by the beautiful creature the heart of the nymph  liam traveling back to the archmage the ritual is 
none	 completed and the phylactery destroyed in time  but not without some lingering necromancy branded within grog they are suddenly approached by the  mysterious elf again saying his master is unhappy with the broken contract and he demands that either  the debt be paid or the party complete a more difficult contract in its place the party  accepts and heads into the shade barrow an ancient druid burial chamber that was purchased  and renovated by an eccentric lord who made it his own tomb fighting the denizens of the barrow  they locate the tomb and 
town	 the iron golem guarding it successfully defeating the golem they tear  the arcane cortex from its chest and return it to drez to square their debt  after a bit of r and r a cleanshaven dwarf named grimthorne propositions the group to enter a  nearby underground fighting ring even offering to represent them the party agrees and  not surprisingly manages to pull off a victory  with the holiday of winters crest arriving the town bustles with preparation for a festival  during which a strange blue crystal is delivered in the name of archmage eskil 
none	 this crystal  suddenly detonates freezing the entire populace of westruun in ice though the party is protected  by a sudden ally in the streets in a lastditch arcane effort a mystic merchant named noja  manages to shield the group from harm and where the crystal previously rested now stood a pale  nude woman of white hair and frail physique she opens a portal and leaps through the party giving  chase into what seems like an icy frozen world chaotic and elemental in nature they catch up to  the woman who then reveals her true 
none	 self a great white dragon weakened by her premature rebirth  the party manages to defeat her and upon returning to westruun discover its people  released from their icy prison  with the archmage eskil ryndarien now on trial for the attack on westruun the party intercedes and  proves his innocence in thanks eskil uses his talents to investigate the source of the blue  crystal revealing the powerful society of thieves known as the clasp responsible for its delivery  vax having previously been a member of the clasp knows the main headquarters lies within the  
none	 capital city of emon and vox machina sets out for the west  ashley upon arriving in the sprawling metropolis of emon the party continues to hear of children  disappearing and reports of a blackhaired goldeneyed boy befriending them before they  vanish while investigating they do a few odd jobs one of which unexpectedly leads them to the  home of syldor vex and vaxs father and his new wife and child awkwardness aside syldor is here  as ambassador to syngorn the elven city of their origin to seek aid from the sovereign uriel  taldorei  
dung	 however the political climate of emon is tense with a recent failed attempt on the royal  familys life making uriel unreachable at the moment syldors connection within the council has  now gone missing and his mission stands at a complete standstill he hires the party to look in  on this missing ally sir gregory fince and get his ear back to syngornian business  vox machina finds sir gregorys home dark and still pushing them to infiltrate and investigate  within they discover a dark presence in the home leading them into a battle with demons in 
none	 the  basement the battle won sir gregorys tortured corpse is found as are his notes about the  attempted assassination on uriel and his family it seems that since the attempt the royal family  has grown strange and withdrawn keeping uriel from the council most hours and his wife now  demanding she attend all meetings whispering in the sovereigns ear and scoffing at the others who  defy their decree  a general krieg thwarted the attempt and is mentioned often the party decides to inquire with  him on their way out of the basement half 
town	 of the party falls into a trap tumbling into a cistern  and are flushed deep below into a subterranean river system the trapped party members vex  keyleth grog tiberius and percy come to rest on a small island in the vast crystalfen lake  home to a terrible aboleth  barely escaping they eventually discover the base remnants of an ancient town long toppled and a  small hut that contains a clever hag named trysta tiberius finds one of his prized artifacts and  makes a dangerous deal to acquire it the party barters for information on 
none	 how to escape which  trysta will give in exchange for their aid in slaying a newly nested denizen that threatens her  work the party agrees climbing to the very top of the crystalfen cavern to do battle with an  umberhulk the fight goes south when grog is tossed from the cavern ceiling nearly dying upon  impact with the island but victory is eventually theirs returning trysta shows them a hidden  staircase that exits into the graveyard district of emon  travis the other members vax pike and scanlan set out to find where the cistern 
town	 could  have drained to scanlan leaves to seek out a map of the sewers while vax and pike notice they are  being followed through the town leading the pursuers into an alley the shadowed figures  attack eventually knocking them both out vax and pike awaken within the clasps headquarters  meeting with one of their leaders or spirelings named modeth the clasp had sir gregorys home  under surveillance as bad political stuff can be difficult for the way the clasp does business and  when our heroes were spotted leaving they had to be interrogated  
none	 vax reveals his membership to the clasp sect in westruun and modeth calls for a test of their  skills and intent pike and vax are then forced to do battle with a chained chimera in the clasps  arena their might rings true and the beast falls beneath their weapons but modeth is not  convinced  while the two are held overnight they manage to escape from the clasps lair exiting into the  night and managing to locate the rest of the party in the graveyard district knowing their next step  is to speak with general 
none	 krieg vax forges a letter of summons using sir gregorys handwriting  and the party is allowed entry into the carefully guarded cloudtop district the innermost area of  the city and home to the citrine garrison as well as emons palace  approaching the garrison they have an audience with general krieg who seems nice and keenly  interested upon learning of the clasps involvement he also mentions the difficulty in  talking with uriel since the attack and is sad about the death of sir gregory but warns to leave  the investigation to the officials  vox 
none	 machina then heads to the palace to try their hand at speaking with uriel but entry is barred  they find another is being prevented from entering a goldenhaired woman in fancy blue  robes who angrily stomps away from the palace doors they engage her in conversation and she  reveals herself to be allura vysoren a powerful arcanist and member of the taldorei council  they discuss the state of things within the palace how uriel is a good and trusted man but  his actions and those of the empress salda are recently suspect after seven days 
none	 of being kept  from the council chambers shes about to give up and leave the party tells her of their findings  and allura leads them to her tower within the district to further discuss the matter in  private  sam within allura and the party make an alliance and keyleth aids her in performing a  scrying ritual on the palace the vision reveals that the family of uriel his wife two  daughters and son are all under the influence of some demonic force and have addled the mind of  their father using him as 
none	 a mouthpiece for their plot  the party decides to pay a visit to the clasp using vax and pikes knowledge of an entrance and  end up in a confrontation with spireling modeth within his chambers the battle ends with modeths  head on the floor and four strange glowing crystals he had been keeping now stolen by the  party they attempt to leave but are met by a host of clasp members and another  dangerouslooking spireling through scanlans deft lies and coercion the party is allowed to  leave unharmed before their deeds are discovered  
dung	 they return to alluras tower only to find the front door ajar and the interior tossed by some  previous scuffle as they reach the top of the tower they investigate finding signs of a  struggle with a demonic entity and alluras escape seemingly successful unfortunately a  magical defense of the tower is triggered and it begins to cave and crumble around them through  some ingenuity and the discovery of a magic carpet the party manages to escape being crushed  within alluras ivory monolith now compacted into a single magical pearl  our heroes then locate 
none	 and enter the home of general krieg finding a brainwashed servant and a  hidden passage that leads to a teleportation circle using the device they are transported to  a distant cavern high in a range of frostcovered mountains and an incredible hoard of gold  jewels and fine trinkets across the room are four obsidian orbs placed within the rock as one  is touched a giant eye appears from within the black crystal and a voice erupts calling for a  brimscythe and noticing the unfamiliar folk mentions intruders i know your face now he  is 
none	 a fool and so are you insect the orbs all crack simultaneously becoming inert  grog dives right in ragelooting the gold but the arrival of the party seems to call the  attention of general krieg who appears at the teleportation circle he angrily denounces the  party and reveals his true form that of a frightening blue dragon  marisha the battle is difficult with many an ally nearly devoured but eventually vax strikes a  mortal blow krieg or brimscythe defiantly smashes against the support pillars of the cavern  in his death throes causing the chamber 
dung	 to collapse the party barely escaping via the  teleportation circle  leaving kriegs home allura finds the party and warns that the evil that feeds on the throne is  growing more bold she herself was attacked shortly after the scrying was complete and barely  escaped  as dark clouds fill the sky above emon the party decides the time to strike has come allura aids  the party in infiltrating the palace and they storm the throne room uriel sits upon his throne  surrounded by his creepily mannered possessed family vox machina attacks managing to banish 
none	  the shadows from within their bodies but the throne itself cracks in half as the dais below  glows a deep red summoning the entity behind the entire scheme a devil prince called juurezel who  tells the party of a great war between devils and demons spilling over into this plane threatening  all creation he justifies his actions and notes all the demonic forces throughout the city and  tells them of the horrible devastation that will ensue if the party stops him  they read him as honest and juurezel asks for their aid in destroying 
none	 the demonic threat  offering a single wish should they make a pact the party deliberates and agrees to the contract  thinking over what they had just agreed to the party returns to the throne room asking for their  wish to be provided to aid them in their demon hunting upon its casting the party wishes to  cancel their contract with the creature and attack  the devil prince angrily reveals his true form a hideous treachery demon a glabrezu a long  deadly and epic confrontation ensues one that suddenly claims the life of the gnomish 
none	 cleric  pike her death fresh in their minds vox machina deals the killing blow sending the demon to its  unmaking  they gather up the cold body of their fallen friend and rush her to a nearby temple of  sarenrae where a resurrection ritual is attempted and succeeds  taliesin the clouds disperse the immediate danger over but the royal family lies on the  throne room floor catatonic upon inspection their souls are missing and their bodies failing  the party recalls the four glowing orbs they recovered from the clasp headquarters behind  modeth now 
none	 identified as soul jars and through a rigorous and tense evening all souls are  successfully restored to the family  a few days pass and sovereign uriel taldorei calls the party for audience he thanks them all  for their bravery heroism and for saving him his family and quite possibly all of emon as  thanks he offers them a place on the taldorei council and informs them of his intent to throw  another winters crest festival to make up for the ones ruined in westruun and here via  assassination attempt where they will be celebrated 
none	 as heroes he has also commissioned the  construction of a keep for them on the outskirts of emon as a sign of his very deep gratitude  a week later the festival begins the populace is out in full force to meet and celebrate vox  machina but during the festivities the party notices uriels son gren speaking to another  child one with black hair and golden eyes they immediately spring to apprehend the child but he  escapes with uriels son they give chase following him into an alley and through a portal  of some kind 
none	  the party finds themselves atop a large island drifting through the astral plane surrounded by a  perilous bramble forest they fight their way through eventually coming upon a gothic mansion  towards the center of the landmass within the party makes their way to the inner library where  numerous kidnapped children are working all about the place cleaning nervously  the dread emperor as he calls himself stands from his chair the child illusion fading into a  goldenarmored man with long black hair four children chained at the neck to his breastplate  he attacks the 
none	 party with fierce magic mindcontrolling all of his child servants to  attack as well with the first blow dealt they realize that damaging him also hurts the chained  children one boy accidentally falling in battle to keyleths magic eventually they succeeded in  destroying the dread emperor and return to emon with a host of lost children happily now found  six months of peace follow as their new keep is constructed and the party scatters to their  separate business until its completion upon their return they assess their new abode with delight  naming it greyskull 
none	 keep they then send out job inquiries seeking guards for hire and servants  after an impromptu tryout they settle upon their new hires  matt that evening the party receives a visitor in their friend arcanist allura vysoren she  happily sits with the party for dinner and trades tales of their past months before asking if she  could hire their services for a matter of great personal importance alluras longtime friend and  ally lady kima of vord has gone missing following a vision quest from her deity the  platinum dragon bahamut her last letter spoke

town	 tree is as you all begin to gather for this central moment of the festival keeper yennen  steps up cassandra steps up with him and you can see hes looking over the crowd eventually  meeting percys gaze  taliesin all right  matt he leads you up onto the stage the three of you stand out amongst the rest of the crowd as  everyone gathers the children are sitting in the front expectantly with their hands under their  legs looking up with big smiles some of them are covered in candy and whatever else theyve managed 
town	  to acquire throughout the festival the music begins to slowly die down until silence hits and a  small cold breeze begins to blow through as you see a couple of fresh flakes of snow begin to fall  from the sky above whitestone  the keeper looks out over the crowd as the hush takes the rest of the group friends families  brave soldiers and defenders of this wondrous city we gather today to celebrate for the first  time in many years our own winters crest festival theres some clapping it is on this  day 
town	 that we remember centuries ago when erevan the ice king keeper of the far realm of ice and  the elemental planes attempted to tear his way into taldorei was kept at bay and sent back  packing from whence he came there are some cheers from the crowd in this we also are  reminded of family reminded of friendship and the bonds that we as a people keep ourselves and  our families safe that we rise up to the occasion to show true heroism to stand by our beliefs and  not let the darkness swallow our 
town	 hope and by that we are able to bring to you this day the  surviving members of the de rolo family cassandra and percival  you hear some whistles from the crowd and some cheers well up again some shouts de rolo  some yells from the crowd keeper yennen puts his arms out these two among friends vox machina  the intrepid adventurers from emon spearheaded our freedom from the terrible tyrant ruin that  the briarwoods had set us upon so today we celebrate not just our joint friendships we  celebrate true heroism and give thanks 
none	 that there are still looking to you percy people who  will do whatever it takes to rise to the good of this land he looks to cassandra who in the  long run know the right choices to make and amongst the darkness still choose sight of the  light may we all raise our glasses to the prosperous future of this city amongst the  alabaster sierras and to the continued future of the de rolo family  everyone raises their glasses up huzzah  cheering  matt cheers everyone drinks the music swells again people begin to 
town	 cheer and scatter and  keeper yennen leads you guys off of the stage the rest of you gather up as some people come up and  shake hands and express their gratitude and thanks as the crowd begins to die off a little  bit keeper yennen gives you all a look and beckons you over if you wouldnt mind a moment  of your time i think there are a few things we need to discuss  taliesin of course  matt cassandra she comes as well and you all step off out of the festival for a 
none	 while a few  folks attempt to follow to see whats going on some of the guards usher them away you guys are  led into an empty building looks to have been a home of some kind that has long since been  abandoned as you step inside its cold and still in here very low light other than a little oil  lantern thats been lit by one of the guards as you step inside the door closes behind and keeper  yennen turns around there is no real way that we can show our appreciation for what 
none	 youve done for  our people but first and foremost there are funds within the de rolo family treasury left  behind by the briarwoods that we hope could help compensate for some of your expenditures and  hardships youve undergone  laura so many just so many  matt this is of course at the behest of the de rolo family  who are the inheritors of this fortune  marisha thanks percy  laura percival youre looking very attractive today  taliesin i know  travis very appropriate  matt now weve had a few weeks of peace 
town	 and recovery of rebuilding and reforging the real  bonds of this society here in whitestone but going forward there needs to be a governing  force i would like to ask of your wisdom and guidance all of you in deciding on what is to  become of the future of this city there are many options at our disposal im overseeing a myriad  of things throughout the town and as a man of religious importance given the history the  people have recommended it does not behoove me to take any sort of position of ruling in 
town	 this town  it would be natural of course for the people to without question follow anyone of the existing  bloodline he looks both to cassandra and to percival have you any thoughts on this matter  any of you  sam of our members only this one human over here on his hands and knees is the expendable one of  our group  laura hey  matt at which point the strange burly man on all fours at this point brother who did not  really notice goes is that your bear  laughter  laura maybe 
none	  taliesin yes  matt strange folk   sam i dont think any of us would well percy if youd like to stay and rule  liam freddy this is everything youve worked for  sam this is your birthright and youve earned it  taliesin it was really not my birthright i was not raised to rule  sam but you would be a fantastic ruler  marisha and also sometimes those birthrights are thrust upon us  taliesin i still have work to do outside the city ripleys still on the loose and knows far  too 
town	 much and i feel more than a little responsible for her and what she may do honestly  cassandra had a better upbringing than i did for this sort of work  matt at which point cassandra pipes up and goes well i understand what youre saying brother  but im still rediscovering who i am if the people of this town knew what ive done what i  was responsible for all these years  marisha you mean surviving being held hostage surviving an ambush and being pelted with arrows  taliesin they expect better of us i know 
none	 i understand we are held to a different standard  and its difficult perhaps its time for a council perhaps its time for shared rule there  should always be a de rolo in whitestone but perhaps we could share the weight  matt we could i could  taliesin yennen would you be comfortable sharing some of this burden  matt hes taken aback and thinks well in the sense of a council that youre recommending that  would be certainly a more comfortable position for one such as myself there are a number of  community leaders that 
none	 have really stepped up and shown their true quality yes this could be done  wed have to ask the people of course of the city and make sure that that would be all right  with the folks but i think given the way things have been that shouldnt be too hard of a sell  laura do the de rolos still stay in the giant castle or does that go to somebody else then  taliesin i think the de rolos keep the castle but i think we use the castle to  sam wait would you be 
none	 on this council and who would they be counseling is there no superior  primate is there no theres no  matt i believe what hes suggesting is that we make decisions by council by vote  sam a triumvirate  matt if you will  taliesin quintumverate  sam oh four people  taliesin five  travis a flatterdesplat  sam flibbertigibbit  taliesin a religious leader someone from the farming communities someone from the economic  community someone from the trade community  sam someone from the gnome community  taliesin from the citizenry  sam from the 
none	 gnome community  taliesin from some known community yes  sam i accept  taliesin interests will be thought of and there will always be a noble to be a tiebreaker when  necessary and to judge from a place of sighs greater good  matt cassandra she steps back at this point and she looks her hands shaking visibly she  looks up to you and steps forward and reaches up and puts her hand to the side of your face and  looks to you with a piercing honesty and fear she lower lip quivering whispers to you 
none	 percy  can i be trusted do you trust me  taliesin all things considered i think that youre more trustworthy than i am at this point  lets not forget that i was the one who let you down first  im going to give her one of the stones  laura we were no that was for the whole group that was for the whole group percival  matt what is this  sam its done  liam leave it alone  laura muffled thats was going to save your fucking life later  taliesin youre going to 
none	 be so happy when we have instant access to the treasury  laura all right  taliesin if anything bad should happen if theres any need of quick retreat or quick  communication this is a oneway trip to us and in return this is a oneway trip for us to you  in case of emergency  matt she clasps it in her hand holds it to her chest  taliesin you were born for this you were instructed in how to do this where i never was  laura and now youve got four other people keeping an 
town	 eye on you  matt she smiles and closes her eyes what you say is true she looks over at each member of  your group and looks back to keeper yennen if it so pleases this intended council it would be my  honor to represent the de rolo bloodline in keeping this town safe  keeper goes then so be it i shall inquire with the people of this town we will forge a council  voted by the greater peoples of this place and we shall restore whitestone to its former glory very  well go enjoy 
none	 the rest of your festival  sam what was that cash prize you had mentioned some sort of  matt well talk with percival  taliesin i will organize  laura oh you have to give it to us it has to come from you that feels shady  taliesin lets not forget that within six hours of meeting each other i ended up handing over an  enormous sum of money to you  laura it was actually 500 gold  taliesin it was quite a bit of gold if i recall you have it written down dont you 
town	 thats so  endearing  liam is it  laughter  matt very well enjoy your festival youve earned it go out be merry let us all remember  this time of year the bonds that we carry the loyalties that we hold to and the heroism you  stand for now go at which point the guards open the door and he steps out the cold air  rushes in and you can see now quite a bit of soft snowfall is now coming upon  the center of the town  liam im sorry is there a washroom 
tavern	 here my sisters a little drunk and managed to yak on me a  bit and i would really love to wash up a bit anywhere nearby  matt he points off to the side theres a small bucket of cold water thats set by the side  liam okay i use it  matt you manage to dampen your outfit to the point of getting it off although it is a bit cold  when you step outside now  laura can i follow him for a moment  matt sure  laura i havent talked to you very
