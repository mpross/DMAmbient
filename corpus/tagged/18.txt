a journey to vasselheim  where they walked through the abundant terrace and into the birthheart itself the temple of  melora within vasselheim spoke with one of the various worshippers there and buried a box of  ashes apparently of senokirs wife  marisha apparently  matt as a thank you for when you guys journeyed and met him in the city of brass on the fire  elemental plane upon doing so you then began to scatter about the city to do some business  one of the elements of which grog /none/ strongjaw along with pike made their way to the trial  forge which is the kord section of the city returning to the trial forge the temple to kord  and upon walking to the center of the strangely empty temple structure you saw down in a once  previously traversed sandpit there stood earthbreaker groon the high priest of kord  who then turned to you  travis my palms are really wet  laura laughs  matt and asked you to show him what you had learned after slamming his feet into the sand  and preparing himself /none/ for conflict he beckons you towards him and that is where we left off so  laura oh god oh god oh god  matt as youre standing up there on the edge of this pit groon just stands there with his hand  beckoning towards you  travis i reach into my bag of holding and i pull out a small drawing of the letter g this  this is what i have learn thats not it  thats not what i wanted and i take out the dwarven thrower and i jump into the sandpit  matt all /none/ righty jumping sound impact thud there as you land in the sand the bottoms of  your boots sinking but a couple of inches

with the hammer at the side knowing that all of your  friends are up on the /none/ outer edges of this watching you you look up at groon who just his hands at  the ready puts them down at his sides and just slow steps  travis awesome  matt just walks up towards you and just stands there your turn  sam like a matador  travis what a dick move what a dick move right clears throat i uh i bow  sam oh

against my chest  and then i chuck it at him  matt all right as you slam it into your chest you can feel the impact and theres that brief  sharp bit of pain as the metal clashes against the muscle slamming against the bone and your rib  cage and that pain just kind of shoots through you like exciting electricity and you harness the  pain as your eyes blur for a moment as you feel the rage overtake you your muscles flexing /none/ and  tensing and with that fury now flowing through your body you take the hammer i need you to go  ahead and make a wisdom saving throw  sam oh no  laura oh shit  travis whispers i knew it louder i mean i didnt know it  sam oh no  travis which is a minus two right  matt yes  travis thats a six  matt as you go to throw the strength leaves your arm and it just hangs limp at the side  the attack is lost  travis any reason why /none/  matt you dont know  travis not that id know cool do i have another attack  matt yeah you have two attacks  marisha he just jedi mindtricked you  travis i shake off the random numb arm and i toss it over to the other hand like  cmon betsy and i throw it with that hand  all laugh  matt okay roll another wisdom saving throw  travis i dont know dd enough to know what the fucks happening right now ooh 16  matt uh 16 actually let me see this real fast  /none/ travis i have a modifier of zero minus two  laura minus two  travis i rolled an 18  taliesin monks are not in my wheelhouse  matt monks are fun  marisha i feel like this guys special too  travis hes not even here this is a dream  liam slowly raishan uncurls like a xenomorph from the ceiling  matt whatd you roll  travis 16  matt nope this time you do manage to push through and throw the hammer but you end up  throwing it way wide like 20 feet away from him /none/ like youre looking at him and just go whoosh  all laugh  matt it comes back and you catch it and youre like somethings just messing with your mind  theres something about his presence right now that is  oppressing your ability to actually attack towards him  travis all right all i have is my bonus action  matt well you used your bonus action to rage right  travis oh i did yeah i dont have a bonus action thats my turn  matt all right he turns towards you walks forward  travis no i /none/ dont  matt very just carefully and intently thats his turn you go  travis god dang it  laura oh

using both hands  travis yeah both hands  matt go for it roll a wisdom saving throw  laughter  liam look at his little boy smile  travis six  matt you go to swing and he seems /none/ to blur for a moment your eyes blink and as you swing with the  hammer you swung far to your left and its almost like your arms are intentionally missing and  almost fighting your directoral sense  laura shut up brian wayne foster  marisha awesome brian fostah  travis this is so stupid okay i keep the hammer in one hand but i just try and punch him with the  titanstone knuckles out of frustration  matt okay make a wisdom saving throw  travis what no weapon in my hand  matt mmhm  travis /none/ nine  matt you go to punch and by the time it gets to his chest theres so little force behind it that  your fingers just kind of unfold open against him almost breaking your wrist in the process  and you pull back and hes just staring right at you show me you have the will to fight  come at me are you going to move or are you  going to stay where you are  travis im going to stay within his attack range but im going to 180 around him  matt okay thats /none/ easy enough to get around here all righty  travis and ill stay there  matt all right for his turn he turns around  travis no he doesnt come on come on  matt your turn  travis oh this is a nightmare i just want to hit him  all laugh  travis all right all right maybe its all about love  and i try and give him a bear hug  matt okay make a wisdom saving throw  travis no  laura you got this  natural 20  travis thats a zero  all /none/ laugh  travis i rolled a two  laura two zero exactly  matt you go to grab him and you reach and you feel this physical form in your  grasp and then your arms all of a sudden touch nothing and you realize that hes standing where  he was you grabbed what was almost like a mirage or an illusion its almost like your brain is  playing tricks on you thats one attack  travis surprised grunt  laura you can do it grog i dont know  what he wants but figure it out  /none/ travis i look so pathetic right now  sam yo how does it look to the rest of the gang  matt it looks hilarious  all laugh  liam what did we just see  matt its hilarious and its disconcerting because youre  watching as grog in the middle of his rage most of his attacks are amateur far too wide  away from the target or by the time they get close he is holding himself back and you dont  know why something is messing with his will and preventing him  from being able to /none/ follow through  with his attacks  travis okay sighs  matt second attack  travis second attack i just want to touch him with my finger just like a boop  matt okay you reach out and your finger touches his chest  cracking sound and you feel  travis hes real hes there  matt hes real the skins there  travis thought you might be a dragon wisdom saving throw  matt that wasnt an attack  travis oh i touched him  matt you touched him  laura great job grog  marisha we believe in /none/ you grog  liam okay now ramp it up  all laugh  matt he smiles at you and goes and with gentleness there comes clarity  travis heavy breathing  sam i think youre going to have to fuck him grog  all laugh  matt and thats your turn  travis thats my turn  matt okay  sam quietly what with gentleness there comes  matt with gentleness there comes clarity and he smiles  through his big whitegrey beard and then the smile fades his eyes flash and he is going to  attack you with /none/ a flurry of blows  laura oh no  travis wait i havent learned the lesson yet im still  matt the lessons just begun  travis oh no  matt all right that is ooh 33 to hit  travis squeaky voice mmm yep  matt that is a 24 to hit  travis squeaky voice yep  matt that is a natural one  so that is a failure and its a 32 to hit so he hits you three times  laura jeez louise  matt so youre raging so you take half damage from these because /none/ theyre bludgeoning  since hes punching you  travis mmhmm  matt his eyes flash he rushes up and pummels  you once in the chin elbows you in the sternum goes and grabs your shoulder and leaps over  behind you and then kicks straight back into the middle of your shoulder blades and pained gasp  you feel the breath almost get kicked out of you  that is 15 bludgeoning damage halved to  travis seven  matt well say eight  travis eight yeah  matt that is nine reduced to five and that is 13 /none/ reduced to seven there you go  travis oh shit thats 20 points of damage cool  matt thats his turn youre up  travis uh yeah sweet sweet anus  marisha thats a really good british candy  travis what do monks do can i like use my magic powers and i want to keep my eyes  closed and im gonna swing around behind me knowing that i just got kicked in the back there  matt okay go ahead and make an attack with disadvantage  travis oh no wisdom saving throw  matt nope  laura /none/ with gentleness comes clarity  you touched him maybe if youdve shaken his hand  travis with disadvantage  matt with disadvantage because you have your eyes closed  travis uh 23  matt that just barely hits  all gasp  matt go ahead and roll damage  travis mumbling okay with a ten  sam so what did we learn from that  travis i shouldve done it reckless no i dont want him  rolling reckless holy shit god ill die in a second  marisha his acs 23  sam no that close your eyes or /none/ how does this what  liam it might be touch  sam im so confused  liam youre unconscious  taliesin youve got the touch  travis thats 18 points of damage  matt 18 points of damage gotcha thats your first strike hitting sound  you feel the weapon behind you make contact with a form and cracking noise you see a little bit  of sand out of your peripheral this side go scattering sound as his form gets pushed about a  foot kind of setting some of it off  travis so it goes low hitting /none/ sound i close my eyes  again i swing around the other way and i try to connect  matt okay roll again with disadvantage  travis thats not bad 14 and 20 uh 29  matt that hits yes  travis yes okay damn same thing so 18 points of damage  matt 18 points of damage all righty  as he takes both impacts kind of parrying them with his forearms with each impact theyre still  hitting him and hes still taking the brunt of the attack and the pain but with each hit you can  /none/ feel the force of his forearm is almost stopping still the hammer blow as youre throwing it behind  you and you can see him gritting teeth with each impact but hes just staring right at you again  as you kind of spin around open your eye again to see what you did  he kind of gives you a bit of a narrowed glare  travis stink eye  matt little bit of a stink eye  travis fuck  matt but like an intentional kind of connecting point and just says  travis pink eye  matt /none/ no thats a whole different thats a different monk path  all laugh  laura like that little hobbit  travis be nice  matt lets see here  travis im a student here  laura whats the lesson whats the lesson  matt okay hes going to go ahead and attack you twice  punch sound two punches straight to your back of your shoulders and neck as youre turning  around to look at him that is a 17 misses no that does hit  travis that hits yeah its my ac  matt and a 23  /none/ travis yeah  matt so both hit you that is  16 so eight damage  travis okay  matt and that is ten so five damage  travis okay  matt and hes going to spend three ki  travis three ki  matt yeah three ki points  so the first punch hits you across  the chin the second one he slams his fingers curled up right into your sternum as you turn  around to face him whack and as it hits you you feel these kind of vibrations ripples  carry through your body and /none/ then slowly fade inside and you feel this tingling this very  faint brief numbness that just kind of lingers throughout your body you can feel it gathering at  the edge of fingertips and toes almost like ripples through a lake and he steps away  you get to make an attack of opportunity if youd like  travis strained i would  matt dont forget you can use your reaction to get an attack back because of  your retaliation ability  travis yeah ive totally forgotten that im just totally stunned at this point  thats good /none/ thats 32  matt 32 hits go ahead and roll damage  travis singsongy noises thats a ten  laura yeah  liam all these sounds are in game in character  travis so 20 25  laura and liam gibberish  marisha laughs when grog becomes popeye  matt all righty and he just stands across the way and just kind of beckons you towards him  your turn  travis and i feel all shakeweighty at the moment right  matt yeah youre not quite sure  you dont feel bad its just this kind of uneasiness in /none/ your body  travis can i take a step towards him  matt mmhm take a step forward  travis does anything happen do i shit my pants  matt nope  all laugh  matt not yet  travis can i take the other four steps  of the five step exploding heart point technique thing  matt seems fine  travis cool  marisha what would you have done if you shat your pants on that fifth step  laura oh my god that would have been amazing  travis just explosive shat id be like kill me /none/ now  kill me now take it away  marisha just lost your bowels  matt laughs id have to bring out the cone template for that  marisha like a very dedicated marathon runner  laura laughs area of effect  travis can i close the rest of the distance to him  matt sure  travis i want to try the bear hug again i want to grapple him  matt okay so go ahead and i think its your athletics versus his  travis so i can touch him now  matt mumbling acrobatics im pretty sure /none/  travis the wisdom saving throw was something in the beginning  laura yeah i think it was  you have to shake his hand or do something like gentle to him  liam i like the idea that its silent in here and were just hearing sand get kicked around  and grog breathing like a bull  laura i like to think that earthbreaker groon has like mood music for his fights  marisha agreed yeah  travis theres frustrated grunts happening  laura hes got a sound system  matt so make an athletics check  travis /none/ okay  marisha like war drums yeah  taliesin like taiko low drum sounds  laura ooh thatd be sick  marisha joins in on the drum sounds totally  travis 24 plus 16 plus eight  matt yeah okay so you go to grab him and he just fwish slips out  travis damn my athletics versus his judo  matt he just kind of like parries it to the side  ducks under and rights himself just out of your grasp  travis cool that was nice do i have a second attack  matt yeah  travis /none/ twohanded great weapon master please  matt okay go for it  travis thats not going to hit 24  matt 24 hits  travis oh it does  matt yeah  travis oh 23 thats right  liam 23 was the threshold  travis thank you god no it doesnt 24 minus five  matt oh minus five so as you go to swing both of your hands on the hammer grunts giant  downward arc as it slams downward you see his form whoosh shift and suddenly hes two feet to  the right he moved so fast /none/ with the side step and you slam it down into the sand you guys  watch as this crater emerges boom and the sand shoots off the sides from the impact of grogs  blow on the ground groon seemingly unaffected  travis that ends my  matt youre not frenzied yet right  travis nope that ends my turn yep  matt okay at the end of your turn hes going to go ahead and make an unarmed attack on you  travis unarmed attack  matt thats just his punch as a part of his legendary action here /none/ that is a 27 to hit  travis oh that hits  matt you suffer another ten points of bludgeoning damage reduced to five  travis okay  matt now its groons turn  taliesin two lair actions  matt hes gonna go ahead and make another series of attacks on you that is an 18  travis yeah that hits  matt 17  travis hits also  matt all right so that is nine plus eight thatd be 17  so say nine points of bludgeoning  travis nine  matt and thenooh 18 so another nine points /none/ of bludgeoning damage i need you to go ahead and  make a constitution saving throw  travis damn gina  liam nice pull  sam i dont get it  travis 21  matt 21 okay as his first hit is a long round haymaker punch across the chin he comes from  underneath and goes for an uppercut that hits you right in the jaw right at the side where usually  it would snap and really mess with somebodys ability to stay either conscious or control their  atmosphere you just manage to maneuver out of the /none/ way where it hurts but the impact doesnt hit its  intended place and you resist the effect  travis what was the effect  matt you dont know  travis god damn it  sam diarrhea  laura instant knockout  travis ill shit my pants before this fight is over with  laura the button  travis on the button  laura its the button  travis its the brown note  matt its your turn  travis my turn i am so tired of this slippery shit i go into a frenzied rage  matt okay  /none/ unenthused cheering  travis yeah thank you i would like to great weapon master  try to hit him with the dwarven thrower  matt go for it  travis not reckless  no crying i dont know what the lesson is 32 minus five is 37  matt 27  travis 27  matt that hits  travis yeah 32 minus five is 37 35  matt okay this one cracks him right across the side of his shoulder and pec area wham  and you watch as for the first time since this battle started he loses his /none/ footing and he has  to catch himself behind his head looks back and he turns around towards you and a big smile goes  across his face as he goes good keep showing me  travis i was encouraged until he got creepy with the talking  laura maybe he just likes getting hit  travis all right i hit him again  matt go for it  travis thats gonna hit thats a 31 minus five is 26  matt yeah go ahead and roll damage  travis 22 32  matt 32 nice  laura hes got /none/

that hits yeah  travis yeah close to what i wanted this is 33  matt okay cool all right so as you unleash your next series of blows against him you saw him  topple from the first hit the other two he pulls his arms in and takes them one to the  shoulder and /none/ the other one hits him in the stomach air getting knocked out and he grabs  your arm and pushes off jumps in the air and lands about five feet from you  travis is he bruised is there a slap mark i mean is there any blood anything to tell me that  i might be doing a good job  matt he looks more so than the previous fight that you had with him  it looks like hes starting to take some hits  travis good yeah  matt hes gonna use legendary action to take a /none/ hit on you  liam a legendary action  matt that is a 30  travis squeaks hits  matt actually its with advantage because  travis yep  matt so that is another nine points of bludgeoning damage  travis sweet  matt not halved that is what it is halved  travis okay because its legendary  matt because it would be 18 yeah  travis right  matt okay his turn he slowly walks around you and says your size is useful for those who know  not how to use it against you and he rushes /none/ down beneath your large standing form and goes  into a series of strikes against the inside of your knees and your legs  and well see how the last blow hits  travis ive been forgetting to roll my enlarged damage  matt thats a 30 on the first hit  travis yep  matt that is a 21 on the second hit  travis high pitched yeah sure  matt that is a 29 on the third hit  travis

there  travis what  matt which would be there  laura hes waiting for you to become unstunned  travis okay  matt and as he darts back you guys watch as he runs /none/ to the back as he does his feet barely  touch the sand fast light footsteps you see these very faint little plumes behind each  footstep as this giant man has almost no weight across the ground  travis like a jackrabbit  mattas he runs with such speed and as he lands and finds his footing loud boom the weight  seems to kick in once more and you watch as the sand scattering sound shoots out behind him  he stands his ground and crosses his arms and just watches so grog its your turn  youre /none/ stunned you end your turn youre no longer stunned its now back to him  travis whispers fuck  matt he puts his hand up puts it up towards you  sam oh no  matt closes his fingers  travis oh no ive seen this before  matt and you feel this pulse in your chest right in the sternum right where he hit you  earlier i need you to go ahead and roll a constitution saving throw again  travis 23 minus two 21  sam ooh  matt 21  sam ooh  travis constitution i /none/ have a lot of for my saving throws  matt that pulse sound ripples out rapid impacts and you feel the muscles begin to tear  the ligaments begin to burn from the inside you manage to through the sheer force of  physical constitution shrug off what wouldve been immensely more deadly circumstance  but you still do take 10d10 necrotic damage  everyone groans  sam it wouldve been 20d10  matt no you wouldve dropped to zero hit points  laura oh shit  travis is that the palm thing  marisha quivering palm  matt its /none/ the quivering palm hes not holding back this time  laura oh no  travis oh i mean dont make any special exceptions on my part fuck  liam vax is

look all bloody yet or is he  matt you guys watch as grog is standing there his body shakes and shimmers and you watch  various veins that usually bulge in his rage and enhance blood flow of his combat just bursts and  splatters bursts in places and blood just seems to spray out of him from multiple positions on his  body  and you see the blood now leaking all over him hes just covered in his own crimson  he slowly /none/ turns around prepares himself for the next round of combat  liam that is some north star shit  marisha oh my god  taliesin nice  travis yeah yeah okay exhales good deal tight wow distance doesnt help okay  laura can you talk to him louder can you talk to him  travis i just look up covered like carrie in the movie just dripping with fake blood  laura never mind youre doing great grog keep going whispers he looks like shit  marisha whispers he does  sam sometimes music calms the savage beast you could /none/ sing to him  travis i would try intimidating presence but hell just shrug it off because hes amazing  liam its fine it looks like hes going to rally here it comes  travis i just take off straight for him  matt okay you turn aroundcounting you just get into melee with him  travis cool awesome i am going to take all three attacks at great weapon master at him  not reckless  matt okay go and make your attacks at disadvantage  laura and travis why  travis because im covered in blood  matt /none/ no because he used his patient defense  sam patient defense  matt essentially with each blow that you  laura oh thats fun  mattswing towards him hes just prepared himself from a defensive position to prepare  himself and hes using your own momentum against you to sway every attack away from him so make  all of your attacks at disadvantage  travis so thats pretty smart i threw that literally into the holder and it was on an edge  shit thats a natural 20 thats going to be replaced by a not as great inhales /none/ sharply  23 minus five so itll be a dud  matt nope so the first blow swings wide he grabs the actual side of the hammer with both  hands and just whooshes throws it off to the side  travis okay okay 31 minus five 26  sam ooh  matt 26 he attempts to parry this one however your sheer force of strength manages to push past  his grasp and you bring the hammer down towards his clavicle go ahead and roll damage  travis exhales oh thank god high pitched i like it when i /none/ hit them normal voice thats 28  plus enlarge which ive been forgetting 20  matt 20  laura 18 and 10 because of your  travis 18 plus 10 for great weapon master 28 30  laura 30 you said 20  travis i said 20 i meant 30  laura its 30  matt you mean 30  travis my apologies he is hitting me really really hard  laura yeah and your brain is already so little  travis its actually large it just doesnt do much  matt and if youre using your bonus action you /none/ can get one more strike in  travis i would like to at disadvantage  matt go for it  travis thats a one  matt nope so the second one does hit the clavicle and it cracks and he grunts  you see a little bit of blood spill out the corner of his mouth down his chin and he looks up  at you and for a second there the whites of his eyes seem to almost dim ever so slightly into a  moment of humanity you havent seen in him yet hes been this godlike entity /none/ and this is the  first point where you see that pain show just a hint of any sort of weakening and he kinda looks  right up into you good good and as you go for your third strike he literally puts up his hand  and heavy impact catches the hammer in place  travis oh god its so awesome  matt he just holds it there as he stares at you  travis groans yeah im checking reflexes  matt good  travis i want you to know im not afraid to go down  matt that /none/ is the first lesson lets see if your words can be put into practice  travis oh shit  marisha good night  laura no no  marisha well see you in the morning sleep well friends  travis i

13 reduced to seven  travis sweet real excited  matt and hes just going to go ahead and rotate /none/ around you to the opposite side as he turns  around punch sounds hitting you as he goes with each hit  travis grunts spurting blood noise  matt i need you to go ahead and make a strength saving throw  you have advantage on these because youre raging  travis yeah i know but i still have minus two to them  matt this is true  laura minus two  liam its going to knock the beard off your face  travis thats better 23 minus two 21  matt 21 okay yeah so the last blow /none/ as he comes round punch noise does a  roundhouse kick and brings back and goes for a huge doublefisted  kind of earthside punch into your torso  travis not the double fist  matt its about to push you backward but you dig in your feet grunts  and resist it and hold your place  laura yeah  travis look whos catching who now  matt now its your turn  travis he didnt have a quip back for me okay right i would like to turn so im facing him  matt okay  travis i /none/ want to pick him up and try and bodyslam him  matt okay go ahead and make an athletics check  travis okay 24  matt no thats a 30 acrobatics  everyone gasps  matt you go to grab and he steps back with his arms still crossed leaps onto your hands as you  reach out for him and just jumps in the air looks down at you before he comes landing right  on top of your hands bam forcing your fists into the dirt  what are you going to do for your next attack  /none/ travis i almost drop out of my rage because that was a real dick move just dunking on me  laura hes jumping and crossing his arms  travis he did the kill bill on my hands i want to try one more time  matt all right roll again  travis 20  matt remember you have advantage on these because youre raging  travis it doesnt matter  matt okay thats a 24 acrobatics as you pull your hands up out of the dirt reaching out for him  with these giant titanstone gauntletencrusted fingers groans and the /none/ sand burst goes upwards  you reach and find nothing but sand and as the sand fades he uses his is this the end of your  turn because you still have a bonus action  travis i still have a third one yeah  matt okay so as the sand is still cascading now you can see his shape through it what are  you doing with your third strike  travis i just want to try and grab a hold of the slippery bastard  matt okay one more time  travis yeah strength advantage or just natural /none/ roll  matt advantage on your athletics  travis okay  liam god it probably looks like hes running in circles to us  travis 26  matt he only rolled 24  laura gasps  matt with the sand there kind of coming down from the impact of you pulling your fists out  you reach out and finally they find purchase on the sides of his arms and doing so you boom  pull him in and grasp him right to your chest the hammer still clutched in your right hand  and you watch as he grunts /none/ gets pulled in now and he is firmly in your grasp  he is currently grappled  travis cool i dont say anything im just really stoked that i actually got him  everyone laughs  travis im like take a picture whatever that is  laura draw it draw it quick percy should i flash him should i flash him  taliesin it couldnt hurt  matt you want to make this into a bodyslam  travis could i  marisha couldnt hurt the rest of us either  matt ill let you sure okay  travis i was /none/ thinking initially id like to remove one of his five hits that he takes on me  but four who gives a shit  matt well say for the purposes of this since your intent was to bodyslam him go ahead  and roll an attack with disadvantage  travis okay attack with disadvantage thats not that great oh regular attack  matt its without your weapon bonus its minus 3  travis yeah 22  matt 22 you grab him and you lift and its like hes anchored to the ground hes much smaller  than you and you /none/ can lift things far larger and denser than him but for some reason he wont  budge an inch hes just staring up at you with his arms pressed to his sides  marisha i want to learn that trick  travis ive still got him grappled at least thats it  matt all right  laura you have to be crouched down in order to be grappling him  travis yeah  marisha its like the possum trick  travis lets just assume that i picked him up im just holding him grappled  or am i squatting  /none/ matt youre squatting down and grappling him  you went to lift him up but grunts he wouldnt budge  travis hugging santas little helper  liam hes friggin third hokage man hes not going anywhere  matt as youre holding him he closes his eyes  travis he closes his eyes  matt and you watch as this kind of warm orangeish white energy begins to just emanate  larua gasps hes going super saiyan  matt from various parts in his body just here in the middle of the forehead a little glimmer  opens here a little /none/ glimmer in the shoulder  marisha hes over 9000  matt his various chakra points begin to glow and you watch as many of the bruises and  bludgeons that you put upon his body and cuts begin to heal up  laura shit  liam i want to be at level 21  sam thats 20 more levels  liam four more years of this  matt laughs and he cant move hes currently grappled all right so thats his turn  you go ahead  travis i still have him grappled  matt you still have him grappled /none/  travis i still want to try to get him to the ground i want to try and get him prone  can i try a leg wrap so im gonna wrap my right leg around his and dive forward trying to push  him offbalance on to his back  matt ill say go ahead and make another athletics check  travis okay 24  matt 24 he got a 21 so well say for this you go ahead youll be releasing the grapple  but you slam him on the ground and make him prone so you manage /none/ to just grunts rip him off  of whatever weird center of gravity hes forced himself into lift him over your head and just  piledrive him into the ground  travis great  matt boom once again you see sand and dust kick up and then you see these two legs sticking  up as youve basically planted him in the ground like a carrot  and he is currently prone on the ground yes  travis great when hes prone do i get advantage on attacks  matt when he is prone attack rolls against the creature have /none/ advantage  if youre within five feet so yes you do  travis great great weapon master dwarven thrower and i say  i want to know the answer to the lesson  everyone laughs  travis 29 minus five 24  matt 24 that hits  travis okay  liam get him big man  marisha give him the chair  travis 35  matt 35  travis plus the enlarge damage  matt nice okay thats your second attack  travis uh 28 minus five 23  matt 23 just hits  travis 9 24 34 38  /none/ matt 38 oof all righty so as youre shouting this the first blow comes down whack youre not  even seeing him or seeing the impact all youre seeing is sand and fury the second and final  blow you bring up and as you bring it down you feel something crack crack underneath  and you watch as you pull the hammer up again he pushes off and hes gonna actually use it at  the end of your turn are you going to move  travis laughs  matt its up to you you can stay where you /none/ are  travis no i would be right there just entranced that hes actually in the ground  matt okay so at the end of your turn hes going to go ahead  and use a legendary action to attack you  travis i meant i run  matt its a 30 so it hits you all right thats 18 halved to nine  take nine points of damage  travis okay  matt and i need you to make another constitution saving throw  travis okay natural 20  matt sick okay as you pull up from the hammer /none/ you can see now theres quite a bit of blood now  out of his mouth and theres a part of the chest where its pushed in and you can see where the  impact has caused heavy bruising and parts of the skin have broken open from impact so now hes  bleeding in places youre bleeding all over the place  travis yeah yeah  matt so its just this mess of two somewhat dressed humanoid men  covered in their own blood its delightful  travis and blood and sand  matt yeah blood and sand its /none/ encrusted everywhere  marisha be careful thats how blood diseases are transferred  taliesin very filthy  marisha be careful  sam sepsis  matt he pushes off and manages to hit you in the sternum once again the same place where the  vibrations hit however this time you grab his hand as it gets there and it still hits you  but the gauntlets absorb the impact and prevent it from spreading through your body that ends  your turn its now his turn he stands up from prone  travis goddamn he did that to me on /none/ my turn  matt yeah  travis laughing thats fucked up  everyone laughs  travis holy shit natural 20 on my turn saved my life  matt okay hes going to go ahead and hit you twice punch sounds that is an 18  travis hits  matt and a 20 so yeah so the first onei need you to make a constitution saving throw  travis okay  matt and you take 14 reduced to half seven points of bludgeoning damage  travis uh 13 on my constitution saving throw  matt 13  travis what was the /none/ damage im sorry  matt seven  travis seven  matt you feel your muscles lock up once more and youre stunned now  travis awesome  matt that allows his attack and since you are stunned attacks against you have advantage  and you are incapacitated so hits that are against you are technically all crits  travis oh fuck  matt so the next hit that went against you is six plus eight  travis can i smile before he hits me  matt sure you go so you feel as your body locks up the next hit /none/ whack goes right into the same  place where he keeps hitting you in the sternum you can feel the bruising now you hear the  crack crack inward as you feel the cartilage there pop inward thats the second hit  he goes in for two more strikes now as youre stunned whoof the next one the third one  thats going to be a 27 that is eight plus eight you take eight damage because its halved  so take eight bludgeoning damage and his final hit that is going to be a 30 that is going to /none/ be  a 6 12 20 reduce that to ten

first strike he goes to parry  but as you hit crack his arm gets knocked out of the way preventing him from parrying the  second strike as it comes down right across the side of the face /none/ boof hitting him you watch as  blood splattering sound across the sand and you see his jaws kinda momentarily dislodged  his beard just kinda crusted in his own blood as you come up with a giant overthehead blow  and as it comes down he crack slaps it from both sides and stops it midaction you see his  hands shaking as hes holding it and he just kinda looks up in your face  good good  travis

of the blow he ends up  landing on top and the outside  travis yes laughs  matt  of the arena boom landing strewn across the steps that lead to the edge of the sand pit  and theres just quiet in the chamber  travis heavy breathing  matt as he stands there breathing heavily covered in blood  theres spatters of /none/ blood all across the sand and  groons just lying there unconscious breathing  laura were just screaming our asses off  matt you guys are yelling  marisha aaaah  travis wait wait wait wait wait stay there  laura what  matt at this point theres the opening at the top of the temple  travis right  matt theres a rumbling sound a rumble from up above and theres a small spark  of energy that cracks up above cracks streaks down and hits groon  laura and marisha gasp  matt  like a very faint /none/ lightning bolt just pfft out of the sky and groon rises up on  the side his eyes just vibrant bright almost glowing and he stands back up and hes still  covered in his own blood hes wrecked you can see parts of his body where the muscle is swollen  one arm appears to be almost ruined but he lands right in front of you  travis little bit of pee comes out  marisha uhhuh  laura laughs everybodys peeing  liam join the party  matt youve learned much and kord smiles upon you  as /none/ you look up and you hear the roiling again and two bolts come streaming out of the top of  the temple down towards grog and slamming into your body you instinctually pull down and hunker  as an animal in a thunderstorm would but you feel the warmth as your gauntlets all of a sudden  flash with electrical energy and you look down as the runes on all the sides and the chains are now  glowing with divine energy  sam youre a magician  travis awesome  matt as the roiling kinda comes to a close /none/ you hear the thunder noises of thunder begin to  subside and you feel the smell of burnt sky and ozone around you begin to subside still looking  down at the energy pulsing through the gauntlets groon is still standing there  looking up at you and just goes  continue with your journey  and just looks at you waiting for some kind of response  travis i walk over to him i bow and then i reach out one of the titanstone knuckles  kords strength to you  matt and slamming noise slams and pulls you /none/ in and with an intensity you feel his fingers crack  even through these newlyimbued gauntlets you feel the tension as his grip is still strangely  you expect he could be powerful enough to crush the gauntlet with his bare fingers he just pulls  you in from your giant form the strength is immense and you grunt kinda pull down into his  form he looks you straight up face to face but an inch away  what have you learned  travis that without the love of my friends life has no meaning and i would be /dung/ nothing  matt and how will you utilize this knowledge  travis i will make their strength mine and my strength their own and in turn  i will try to make the world a better place than i found it  matt his grip pulls off and he withdraws his arm and he releases you  back to your full standing pose  now at your enlarged form gargantuan in the center of this temple space his once very  intimidating form diminutive by comparison to grogs full structure looks up and nods  i thank you  grog /none/ i mean i really i thank you  all laugh  travis ive never gone that far in a battle before i didnt even know that was possible  this was incredible im talking a lot arent i i have a bit of a man crush  matt yes yes you are  travis okay uh thank you  and i turn and i walk back to my friends  matt as you make your way back groon steps and leaps back out onto the opposite side and you can  see on the opposite end of the platform of /none/ the sand pit there is a silver somewhat  tarnished but still functional bell and he walks over to the side of it grabs the rope  and just tolling of a low bell and you watch from all the different corners of the empty  temple all the priests of kord begin to wander back in who had exited previously as was the  request it seems of earthbreaker groon knowing that you were coming  laura whispers oh my gosh  matt they all just silently enter and kind of nod and bow in your direction as you /none/ make your way  towards your friends you acknowledge it but it doesnt slow you doesnt stop you  they are still your focus

selfish intentions  travis we did have selfish in  marisha yeah grog knows what im trying to say  travis we didnt think about those things we didnt we thought about what you meant to us  it may not feel like much to us it feels like a bit but now that youre here  marisha scanlan as much as you can say that you were just the funny guy who played music and made  jokes i dont think you realize how desperately we need that thats nothing to scoff at  /none/ thats not a talent that many of us naturally possess youve taught me so much about the  brightness of the world and to look at the light side of things  sam i guess its just easier to laugh at the world when you dont care about it  marisha thats not true you do care  sam i know  laura thats why hes an asshole now  liam weve never had one conversation you and i about my mother where my sister and i came from  did you know thordak killed her  sam i think /none/ thats come up  liam weve never talked about it not once because i didnt want to talk about it  i didnt push into your private life if you wanted to talk to me and you did about your  daughter we did we talked in the sewers of westruun about your daughter because you wanted to  talk about her we love you scanlan and if you want to talk about your mother or your father  we will you have not been exactly forthcoming  sam thats fair i havent been but i also dont i dont /none/ have anyone  i have to take care of myself thats all  liam we have survived a fucking hellscape all of us  sam quietly i didnt  liam you are standing before me talking to me you did  sam i did not i died twice  liam thats fucking semantics shorthalt  sam in a row  liam youve been brought back youre standing here your daughter is there and needs you  sam im being kept alive by some fuckedup weird magic before i met you people i would have  never the worst i would /tavern/ have gotten in is a bar fight and i would have won cause i would have  been a liar and a cheater and now i didnt help any of you in the last fight i didnt do  anything the fight before that i didnt do anything  liam what about the fight before that  sam  im useless  laura tiredly no youre not  sam  im out of my league im out of my league listen it was fun its fun it really  has been fun to travel with six legends its fun its /none/ fun to say  that your friends are legendary fighters  its fun  liam excuse me speaking as someone who has been fucking depressed for a long time look me in the  eye i was shit for months and you are one of the main reasons i am out of that now we would be  dead all of us if it werent for you the first time we fought raishan we would all be dead  you are in a pity party right now and i know youre hurting and im sorry youre hurting  and i /none/ love you but you are lying to yourself that you have been no use to us you are lying to  yourself  if you wanna retire if you wanna go off with your daughter thats fucking wonderful  i encourage you to do it but dont lie to yourself  sam well thats just it im a really good liar  liam pleading scanlan  sam just give me some time  marisha timidly hey hey guys were friends right are we friends  taliesin worse family  liam family  marisha thats fair  taliesin and for fucks sake /none/ sir i will say i died in that fight too  sam its not fun is it  taliesin no and let me tell you something whatever lie you were trying to feed your  daughter out there about the man she thought you might be that you just thought you could tell her  and then she would walk away and never actually meet you or get to know you so that maybe she  would never see what a shit you can be and you can be a shit that fucking girl out there is a  shit /none/ too shes a miserable lying shit and for fucks sake the thing that brought her  back here was the things about you that you dont like about yourself and dont think that they  dont count either youre a shitty person we know thats not the fucking point the point  is for just one moment one moment once in a blue bloody moon you come through in a way that  others cant and you do it and we love you for it and you are worthwhile theres a reason we  just nearly went mad trying to /none/ bring you back and it was not pity and we didnt bring her we  brought her here so that maybe she would snap you out of wherever the fuck you were going to  and i know youre not out of there yet ive been where you are and i know its shit  and i would really recommend as somebody who misses an awful lot of people that you are honest  with that girl and maybe discover that she actually likes you as a person because you are  actually likeable as a person i know its /none/ coming out of my mouth i can feel the shit from it but  its true and for fucks sake get to know her and stop making false promises that you can  protect her and youll always be there cause you cant and you wont no one can  and youre fucking lying and its sick be a man be a man ive seen you be a man  i know you can fucking do it and when youre done with that and we will leave you with that fucking  shit girl i would like you to look /none/ up my parents name you can find it on every fifth hallway in  this fucking city and then im out  matt hoarsely you leave the room  taliesin mmhm  matt clears throat okay as you push the door open its still partially ajar and as you push  it open leaning against the wall just by the door is kaylie  and you can see she has tears streaming down her face  taliesin i give her a big hug a kiss on the forehead  matt she doesnt let you as soon as you go for /none/ it she just kind of smacks it away  taliesin makes an air kissing noise  mat turns into the room and just kind of walks past everyone and grabs her bag off the ground  slings it over her shoulder grabs her violin case so you coming  sam yeah  matt grab your things be waiting for you downstairs and she walks out  laura really just like that  sam i have to  marisha wherere you going to go whatre you going to do  sam im just gonna be a shorthalt for a while and /none/ im just gonna figure out what that means  and its great being part of a team but you gotta know who you are first so i gotta  go figure that out and i gotta go figure out what she is too and when i do ill come back and  find you and if you really need a place to stay ill advise you to buy some tents cause you  wont have a mansion anymore i know youll be fine cause you all have each other but for now  i just need to have me for /none/ a while i love you all i even love percy and his parents  frederick and johanna and ill go with kaylie  travis wait i reach into the bag of holding and i grab my saltlick rock and i toss it to scanlan  sam whats this  travis its yours now when you miss us i know you will give it a lick  sam choked all right i will  laura i grab the gatestone off the end table where  we left it with him and hand it over to you as well  sam youll /none/ need this  laura id rather it go to you  sam when vex tries to give you something you take it all right dont die  liam scanlan well miss you  sam exhales i hope so and well you said i was right lets pick up that conversation later  ill go out the door  matt okay as he walks down the hall you hear his feet across the stonework echo quieter and  quieter until you cant hear it anymore and you all  stand in stunned silence in the chamber  liam draws in a /none/ breath fuck  laura i just pick up a pillow and throw it at the door  matt it opens slightly the pillow lays on the ground smattered with vanilla pudding  travis did he take all his things with him  matt i would say he wouldve grabbed his things as he left yeah  laura well that didnt go like i thought it would  marisha no no it didnt  laura kinda wish we wouldve gone drinking in vasselheim now  travis we mightve missed him if we had  liam wearily we saved the continent why /none/ does everything feel like shit  travis hes alive thats what really matters  liam but hes our liar grog  laura tearily and he hates us now  marisha he doesnt hate us  i just think weve all just discovered that maybe we have a lot more secrets about  ourselves than weve all ever let on  travis he needs time we have that  laura angrily fuck him fuck him for not saying anything sooner  marisha i dunno  laura and fuck us for not asking sniffs  marisha i think percys right were worse /none/ than friends were family and family leaves  liam yes they do  marisha can we not be family can we like redact that  liam i dont think so i think its too late  travis i step out into the hallway do i see percy at all  taliesin im around the corner up on the  matt yeah  taliesin im outside of if you went far enough youd see me  matt you eventually find percy yeah  travis hey  taliesin hi  travis rough one that question  taliesin yeah  travis do you /none/ have any like sneaky people in your employ here in the castle  taliesin course  travis wouldnt you feel better if we had someone just keeping an eye on them bit  explosive the two of them together  taliesin im torn i dont know if hed like that  travis i dont know if i care laughs  taliesin i dont know if i do either i keep thinking i could just shout right now and half a  dozen guards would stop them  travis yeah itd be half a dozen dead guards though  taliesin well /none/ whats half a dozen dead guards these days  travis good point  taliesin theres tale of a brothel in the west end of whitestone i dont know if it still exists  but im sure if you go drinking in that area you might find something sorry  travis no yeah yeah ill go give it a look  taliesin when youre in the mood  travis nows good yeah ill be back after nightfall gonna go out for a bit  taliesin grog  travis yeah  taliesin i know we dont always agree and i know that /none/ i can be unkind but  you know youre family right  travis i dont know much but i do know that  taliesin its nice having an older brother again  travis i leave  marisha so what just the halfelves are left alone in a room covered in pudding  matt yeah  all laugh  matt yeah basically  taliesin way to paint a tableau  marisha crying  matt yeah crying in your pudding  marisha angry  taliesin i think crying in your pudding is actually a british saying  marisha do you think that /none/ if we wouldve not covered the room in pudding  that he would have stayed  laura i start cleaning it up  well he seemed pretty pissed that i went and got kaylie  even though he ran away with her at the first chance he had  marisha and you had to stay in a shitty bnb a brothel and laughs  matt you see that pike is still kinda shaking her fist in the corner right now she doesnt say  anything during this whole exchange  liam pike  laura pike are you okay  liam /none/ how you doing pickle  marisha oh right pike right  matt he needs to do this right he needs to do this  laura he says he does  matt what do we need to do  laura i have no fucking clue  matt i need to get a drink  marisha yeah we could always go back to vasselheim and pick up on that little drinking  laura im not gonna go anywhere keyleth  marisha yeah  liam i dont wanna go back to vasselheim  marisha i mean we can drink anywhere vasselheim doesnt have /none/ to be in that equation  matt where else do we have to go away from here i just want to be away from here  liam pike  marisha i have to go to the water ashari i have to  liam and before too long we have a demon who wants you and i  dead in the night we have to deal with it  matt all right anything else  marisha pike you know the ozmit sea youve sailed it yeah  matt its been a while but yeah  marisha we might need you for /none/ the water ashari  matt i can do that  marisha seems like i guess all of us are picking up on  our own individual paths from here i guess  matt why cant we still help each other out  liam we can of course we can pike  matt his path is his own he has to do his thing alone we dont have to be alone  liam no no we dont we just wanna slow things down for a while  its been a long couple of months  marisha is scanlan right have we /none/ become too close to each other do we need to all take our  individual time like weve done in the past  liam no we just need to not have our lives on the line every day for a little while or ever  retirements not a terrible idea i mean whats the takeaway here from scanlan cant  hold anything in fuck you know that ive always looked up to you for everything that ive tried  to model myself after you do you know that and you  you know that shes my best friend right you /none/ know that  marisha course  liam you know that im madly in love with her right you know that right we dont need to  joke about it or dance around it anymore you know that im in love with her right  laura obviously  liam obviously  marisha what are you getting at vax  liam i just dont he left because he felt like we didnt know him im scared to death about what  i have to give to a fucking god eventually im scared of that i dont want to do that  but /none/ its going to happen and its destiny im scared about that there thats out  do you have anything that youre holding in youre in love with percival we all know that  right its plain as day right  laura my takeaway from scanlan is that we all talk too much and i leave the room  marisha and then i look at vax and percy and say  taliesin  oh im not there  matt percys not there  marisha oh sorry vax and  matt pike  marisha pike and say and my takeaway is that maybe /none/ we were forgetting who we were before we all  banded together and then i leave the room  sam theyre all individually going to the room next door  all laugh  matt yeah theyre all just congregating in the next chamber  laura and thats where scanlans waiting  taliesin its like a black mirror episode  sam everyones reading highlights  liam crack out the aerator yo  travis highlights  laura blacklight  marisha its the basement in westworld we all just go catatonic  matt pike kinda walks up to you as they walk out /none/ of the room and puts her gauntleted hand on your  shoulder and just says we all make mistakes i make em a lot  liam yeah  matt you have a lot of other people to look up to aside from just me  liam ive learned that  matt his path is his own and hell come back right  liam i dont know but hes our friend i like having him around  matt me too sighs lets get a drink  liam what  matt lets get a drink  liam lets get a drink you /town/ wanna go in town  matt yeah  liam all right  marisha i chase down vex and we do the same thing  matt you guys all individually find your way through the rest of the afternoon to discuss  cope with and ruminate on the separation of scanlan going through all the different emotions  you feel that are necessary and whatever  activities you proceed to distract yourself with grog  laura laughs crying in a corner  liam mockcrying  travis crying on bosoms mockcrying  all laugh  travis ill pay for this  matt /none/ yes you will thats extra  all laugh  matt and strangely not uncommon  liam hes wrapping up the show i can tell so i came to give sam a hug  laura hes not no hes not  matt hes not actually i dont know where you got that idea  liam well i was just getting in a midgame hug  matt there you go laughs  taliesin this is awkward  matt you guys still got shit to do  laura guys no stop it  matt you guys made promises youre still on a timeline /none/ for some things  travis yeah  matt you still have things to do  marisha no we know  taliesin we know  liam we know  matt dont take that as sam closing the curtain here still got shit to do  liam i know but i craved that so i took it  matt no thats okay crosstable hugs are fine  taliesin that was weird  matt the next morning comes around youre all in various states of hungover should you have chosen  to imbibe with the rest of the party  liam heavily  /tavern/ matt grog eventually wanders in less hungover but more meek about how his previous day was  travis not my best night  marisha i see vax the next morning and i say look your sister gave me one of her blue  feathers its because this is the darkest timeline  laura i come back and i take that off im like no keyleth you took that from me when you were  drunk last night actually  marisha its because this is the darkest timeline and i stole it from you  liam pike and i come in /none/ wearing fun buns hungover my face hurts  laura how is everyone  matt she slaps you  travis amazing  matt does it still hurt  liam yeah and also my face hurts as well  matt good  laura percy  taliesin good morning  laura morning  marisha what did you do last night  taliesin worked  marisha worked you were productive  taliesin well  marisha you made the rest of us look and feel like shit  taliesin i think we all have our ways of coping  marisha what did you make  /tavern/ taliesin just some sketches  marisha did you bake a cake i hope you baked a cake  taliesin theres no cake  marisha i really want coffee cake right now percy  taliesin there are people for that  liam you look like me  laura squishsquish squishsquish  liam you look like me why do you look like me  laura youre still drunk sober up its a new day  liam thats boring  laura laughs oh shit he couldve broken his nose just then i swear oh my god  marisha is it a new day /tavern/  laura it is  matt it is  marisha i thought it was still yesterday  taliesin oh hey ive got all my hit dice back thats nice  matt yeah spells are back you guys are healed  marisha my staff is charged  laura youre up from nine points  travis yeah  laura hey wake up fuck wake up its a new day open your eyes hey  matt pike casts restoration on vax  laura hey youre not drunk anymore look at that  liam i feel good  all laugh  travis all right /none/ so what first step is the most important one right  taliesin well as far as i know we have three things still on our plate  matt which ones  taliesin weve got a hand  liam hotis  taliesin weve got the ashari and weve got a demon  marisha we also have research we have to look at that we got from that lair of raishans  travis whats the hand  laura we have to give ripleys hand to those guys in marquet i think thats the easy one  liam that seems like the quickest /none/  matt thats definitely the quickest  travis lets try that  liam my mental acuitys on point  marisha i feel like if i teleport im gonna puke  matt pike grabs a bucket  all laugh  taliesin i run to the kitchen i put together something that is not quite but probably a hot  sauce with half a raw egg and shot of something that is quite possibly  but not quite some sort of fantasy variant of tequila  marisha you are not  taliesin swirl it all up  marisha  fratboy oneshotting me /none/ this  taliesin this is a thing  liam thats science listen to percy thats science you need that and you need a traditional  whitestone breakfast  laura its super good keyleth really  taliesin yeah just get it down just get it down  marisha why this  taliesin dont look at it  liam just listen to the science guy and chugalug  travis bottoms up  taliesin i was kidding you shouldnt actually drink that  marisha fuck you motherfucker  taliesin can i get a roll damage  all laugh  taliesin ive done something /dung/ very similar to that on many a morning  marisha we need to look at this research we need to figure out what raishan had going on  laura my brain hurts from crying so much yesterday  marisha i know are my eyes puffy  taliesin yes  marisha do i have bags under my thank you  taliesin youre welcome  liam you wear it well  matt so whats the plan whats up first  taliesin lets take a quick look at what we got from the cave  laura maybe bring allura and gilmore in here /none/ because  we have that book that seemed very nefarious  marisha i help percy figure things out  matt okay from the things that you gathered off a lot of them were candleholders there were  various reagents some of them rotted or dried out a number of books and tomes some that deal  with poisons various alchemy actually a similar book to the one that you found earlier in your  travels but an older version of it and there is the one large tome that you acquired that had the  more nefariouslooking leatherbound exterior the /none/ thicker piece  travis ill read this  laura no dont touch it grog i dont trust it i want allura or gilmore to look at it first  matt the easiest person to find here would probably be allura in the castle well no  because alluras off in emon helping with the destruction gilmore would be the only one you  could really speak to currently  laura or eskil  matt or eskil but hes a little wary of you at the moment laughs  laura i just keep making people wary of me  matt all /none/ right so you go ahead and you bring gilmore in  marisha yeah  matt okay and its easy enough to bring in hes just waking up yawns  so what can i help you with  laura hi  taliesin we found this be careful it was with raishan  matt he takes it he sits down and places it on his lap and tugs on his braided goatee  this smells like shit  taliesin several things have died on top of it  liam i give my armor a sniff  matt smells different kind of shit /none/ but shit nonetheless he takes a look over it  this has a very faint magical essence to it  let me go ahead and  he looks over it for a second his eyes glow with that same  arcane purplish energy that flares when he does  the identify spell looks over it  this is an evil book reading this would be informative but would certainly have a cost  travis like money  matt soulmoney  laura soulmoney  travis do we have any of that in the bag of holding  laura i dont think /dung/ we do not anymore  matt wouldnt recommend it grog  taliesin what do you recommend we do with this book  matt well if you ever feel like you want some light reading or find somebody whos foolish  enough to read it or at least has the willpower to push through  its dark enchantments i have no idea  travis oh shit  laura lets just keep that in a  taliesin going to vault that for the moment  laura yeah  travis youre saying somebody could read it but theyd  have to make it /dung/ all the way through the end  matt i dont want to look into it ill put it that way but somebody with a strong enough mental  aptitude to be able to not be corrupted by its dark magics  its my recommendation at the very least  taliesin not anyone in this room is what hes saying  travis right what else have we got  taliesin i say hand its simple to the point  laura i agree  liam i agree one and done  taliesin and we can find the ashari on the way back /none/  marisha yeah we can  travis all right  laura this feels wrong  travis it feels different  liam ah it feels wrong  marisha thats not on us though its on him  laura can you scry  marisha me  laura yeah see where he is what hes doing  marisha i pull out the scrying eye can i hold it out in front  this is kind of flavor and i let it levitate in front  matt it locks itself in place and slowly rotates  marisha can i open it like a fortunetellers /none/ spying sphere type of crystal  laura and just like project it on the wall behind her so we can watch it like that movie  matt the vision comes to you it doesnt quite do that  marisha that would be really awesome  travis can i make it imax  matt i want that hd download not the sd  marisha 51 dolby digital surround  liam whoa its all around me  marisha oh my god so many lagging issues  travis whats he rolling for  laura to see if he senses it maybe  liam /none/ you dont know  matt so whats your wisdom modifier  sam me  matt your wisdom saving throw  sam negative two  laura wait what did you roll  matt whatd you roll  sam i got a two total but i get advantage against magic  matt you do  sam thats a 17  matt plus your whats your wisdom saving throw bonus  sam i mean thats 19 my wisdom is negative two  matt oh minus two got you and your spell dc is  marisha oh im spying on those bitches  matt /none/ okay so you get a brief view of what looks to be scanlan  wearing his regular outfit and armor now  marisha he took his armor off hes just regular clothes  laura no he walked out in a fucking nightgown  matt he walked out in a nightgown  marisha oh right yeah  matt through this whole emotional circumstance he was in a nightgown but he is currently  hes walking through the parchwood forest that surrounds whitestone he is on the path south  marisha south of whitestone  matt yeah south of whitestone to his /none/ left is kaylie and theyre both with their sacks over  their shoulders and theyre just hiking through the forest theyre at the moment not talking  but theyre both slightly smiling just kind of enjoying the journey and the company and you  just watch them walk for a little bit through the thick tree canopy above the wellworn path that  heads south and out of the parchwood  marisha he looks content happy even  laura thats good  liam yeah good on him  travis can you yell at him  marisha i feel like hes /none/ like flicking off a bunch of trees now  i dont know he was always an odd one  liam to be fair he did that about seven times a day  all laugh  marisha he did yeah  liam for no reason  marisha i never knew his animosity toward trees  matt you never know  sam just in case  marisha i dont know  all laugh  liam and laura just in case  marisha just really hates oaks  liam raven queen demons you never know whos looking over your shoulder  laura we /none/ shouldve invited kaylie to come with us they couldve stayed  liam they dont want that  marisha i have a feeling theres little chance we could talk him out of it well all right  hes living a nice happy content lowkey life now lets continue on  liam yeah and why shouldnt he he earned it  travis yeah  marisha yeah he did  liam he earned it  travis quietly dick louder sorry what  laura yeah right  marisha he saved the world what more could we ask of anybody  travis lets go what /none/ clears the brain better than travel sniffs or sex  liam wait stop stop i was about to say you sounded very wise dont fuck it up just period  travis period  liam travel and sex done  marisha you know theres merit to that all right lets go  laura as we head to the tree i pull grog aside and i ask him are you all right grog i mean  i know i know you got your lady favors out of the way and all that but scanlan was your  bestie right outside of pike /none/  travis yeah im just bummed because im glad hes alive  laura well yeah  travis i think thats what keeps us from being terrible but like sniffs i only trust like a  few people in the world you scanlan and pike and now its just you and pike  laura me and pike  travis no i mean i trust the others right but like i know you on a more intimate level  laura cause you saw my titties  travis pretty much  laura yeah  travis yeah um  marisha thats literally it i /none/ dont know if theyve ever had like an in depth conversation  all laugh  travis so  laura right  travis thats all i just i just feel a little more sad on the inside but im all right  laura im sorry grog  travis yeah im glad hes okay  laura me too  marisha show him your titties again  laura do you want to see them would that make you feel better  travis no its not right right now  laura yeah no it didnt feel right i just wanted to all right  /none/ travis yeah you know its mmm you know  all laugh  travis i appreciate the offer  matt as you walk your way down to the center of whitestone to the sun tree  liam its so touching and ridiculous at the same time  matt i know you recall that in the center of the city itself ankharel as it acts as one of the  largest oases in the center of the central marquet desert there are a number of larger trees of  various types and theres one not too far from the suncut bazaar that /none/ you recall you make that  your designated tree and upon casting the spell you watch the sun tree tear open the doorway  and you step across  marisha as i cast the spell i just say hey sun tree watch over scanlan and kaylie  okay and then go though  matt you step through okay you all emerge on the outskirts of the suncut bazaar at this point  in time it would be the beginning of just past dusk the sun has gone down in ankharel  but you can still see the oranges and reds /town/ and purples of the recent sunset in the distance  the city is bustling lanterns are alight all throughout the bazaar itself and all the various  multicolored towers and structures and buildings the beautiful city just stretch up in all  directions around you you can see the bazaar itself is lively with carts that are open  shouting as various barkers are peddling their wares its a very upbeat atmosphere and one  thats a stark change to the whitestone you just stepped away from  liam and the sun is going down you said  matt the /tavern/ sun has already gone down  liam after we just woke up  matt yes  liam jet lag  laura we fucked up  matt yeah other part of the world  taliesin jet lag  liam yeah what  taliesin tree lag  marisha tree lag  liam its a bitch  matt laughs tree lag  marisha its the worst  matt you guys begin making your way toward  the debts respite which is the tavern  that housed the scarbearers this is where treev  bonebreaker was when  you last discussed the return of /none/ ripleys hand  laura right  matt  as the assassin that killed one of their own and youre returning this hand to absolve  yourselves of implication in this murder  marisha yes  matt since you discovered the body  taliesin im for the record not wearing the cloak when we do this  matt okay  laura and marisha hey  matt good point  taliesin and just for the record i know ill get yelled at for twitter on this i have informed my  sister where im going and whats going on not just going /tavern/ willynilly  matt right right cassandra is aware all right you guys walk through you catch a few eyes as  you are not
