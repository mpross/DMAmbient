 /none/ travis its just a mythical thing you dont question it  matt i love me some breakfast pizza i didnt know if it was actually breakfast pizza or he got  regular pizza and somehow it got an egg on it  marisha its like slapstick pizza  taliesin its very embarrassed pizza  matt hmm thats weird anyway lets go ahead and bring it down here as we return to the realm  of exandria for tonights episode of critical role  sam is something happening now  matt i hope so i hope were at the intro  /none/ dramatic music  matt hello and welcome back everyone so to bring us into tonights game lets do a little  recap of recent events this group of intrepid adventurers vox machina found their way towards  the city of westruun which had been partially destroyed by the attacks of the chroma conclave a  dangerous group of chromatic dragons very powerful entities that tore through the  countryside in the wake of this destruction the herd of storms a roving barbaric tribe that grog  once belonged to swept in and conquered the city of westruun they made an /town/ accord with the  returning black dragon umbrasyl that they would alleviate most of the spoils of their findings  toward it and as such would not be in conflict with such a powerful and dangerous entity vox  machina swung into the town cut down the rather brutal and ruthless leader kevdak and aided his  son who seemed to be of more honorable mind zanror and grog himself to temporarily take the  herd in its current state and use this moment to surprise and hopefully take down this ancient  black dragon known as umbrasyl the hope /none/ devourer they set a trap they sprung it and  kept the dragon close to the ground as long as they could dealing vast amounts of damage but not  enough to stop it as it began to tear through the herd as well as vox machina itself vax and  scanlan had through the use of magic and ingenuity teleported themselves inside of the  dragon didnt seem to go as well as they intended as the dragon took off leaving a  dangling grog with his axe and chain stuck in its side flying off towards the high /none/ darkened  mountain of gatshadow the midair battle ensued as they tried to find ways to carve their way out of  the beast vax utilising the embedded arrow hole and loosening the tension of the muscles with the  dragon blade at his disposal scanlans technique a little more sensual  sam i fisted it  matt you fisted the dragon and as such found your way out during this period of time vax  embraced the blessing of the raven queen taking a level of paladin grog got more intelligent  briefly as a giant eagle and you /none/ managed to reconvene with your party members as the dragon  went to recover within its lair at the top of gatshadow you then encountered a very elderly  goliath who you hadnt seen in quite some time named shale who spoke of the scouting crew that  had been obliterated by the dragon you followed shale as she led you up the mountain to where the  dragons current lair resides you did battle with umbrasyl a very hardfought battle many of you  taking a bunch of damage but you prevailed and grog dealt the death blow killing /none/ the dragon you  all began to sift through its hoard the bulk of which we will be doing as you rest into the  evening here shale shambling down the mountain on her own to see the rest of her greater destiny  so as we come back youve all decided to take an evenings rest to recover from this heinous battle  that you just suffered you carved out some elements of umbrasyls corpse that were not  destroyed by the anger and might of grog i believe i told you a tooth count a blood vial  /none/ count what did i not give you from the remains of the black dragon  sam we dont know what we dont know matt  travis scales and claws  marisha i dont know if i got a tooth count either  laura oh you got three vials of umbrasyl blood is all we have  taliesin it was a lot of teeth  matt yeah it was 15 or so i believe because a lot of them were destroyed from the perpetual axe  smashing in the mouth  laura do you want me to write them in the /none/ bag  travis make sure it was dead  matt yeah exactly it was the more important part really  laura im writing the body parts in the bag of colding  taliesin whats a dragon kidney stone worth  laura 15 teeth  marisha does it turn into a pearl  taliesin it might do you know a diamond  laura what about scales  matt well ten dragon claws were harvested from this entity and about and its going to take you  quite a while youre probably not going to be able to rest if you continue /none/ to harvest from the  corpse to get scales off of it at this point because its more dragonhide than just  scales youre taking the hide off of it and youre going to need a team of people and an  extended period of time to do that well  taliesin i said i was going to help with the sword with that process since ive got it  matt okay that does help its still going to be theres a lot of hide  travis we only have like 60 pounds of scales from previously left over  /none/ thumps  laura what is happening  travis umbrasyls ghost  matt yeah ravaging the countryside from the east  sam were still in the lair  matt you are still in the lair yes  marisha we have 60 pounds of scales left  laura yeah but these would be umbrasyl scales this way we can make umbrasyl black dragon armor  travis then we can have yeah black and white scales  laura yeah yeah yeah but we could make dragonhide with dragonhide you could make badass  armor right  liam yeah we could have done that /none/ ages ago  marisha laughs i want some black and white armor how  matt do keep in mind the bag of holding can hold upwards 500 pounds to the max  laura oh  matt just be aware  sam its not infinite  matt no  laura oh i thought it was infinite  liam also many of the shops that can do that kind of thing are destroyed so  travis oh were okay theres not a bunch of big stuff in here  taliesin well get some we should get some  sam what about the /none/ gold did we find out how much gold  matt were about to find out  laura well okay im definitely doing that while theyre working on the dragon  taliesin well work on the scales  matt as you guys are working on the scales  marisha i want to work most of i want to take as much as i can  matt of the scales okay thats fine hide dragonhide well say scales themselves are just  little pieces used more for alchemical elements can be removed from hide later so well call it  hide so /none/ i want you to go ahead and make an investigation check laura  laura oh man come on 20  liam also i believe i was first to the pile i was looking for what weapons there are and i also  want to watch her very closely with everything she does  laura does this have to do with dragons is it an investigation about dragons  matt uh no this is more to do with the gold  laura what about because im in a mountain and its my favored terrain  matt your favored terrain ironically is /none/ not gold it is mountains however when you level up  as a ranger if you choose to your next favored terrain should be gold just as a character choice  laura im just checking for i wanna be sure im rolling what im supposed to  liam singing ducktales wooooo  laura 13 is all that i rolled though  liam with a swimming speed of 40 in gold  matt it is quite a lot of gold as you start counting up a section of it and you being a very  very discerning eye youre looking upwards /none/ of around 78000 gold pieces  laura oh but some of this is westruuns  matt a lot of this is westruuns  ashley is it though  laura it is it is it is you know what im going to keep it im keeping it in a separate  stock because i dont want to take money away from westruun  matt just so youre aware thats 1570 pounds of gold you cant carry all that  ashley if we separated it  laura well were going to put a marker in it and let westruun know that this /none/ is their gold and then  well send them up  travis oh thats fair then they can come back up and get it  laura yeah they can cause how else are we going to get it to them im just going to take a  little bit of it  matt how much you taking  sam 20  travis 15000  laura what we put in is still down on the ground  marisha how much did we put in  liam ten  laura i think we should take 10000  travis higher higher  laura /none/ but its westruuns money  ashley we can let the people decide  sam and we have spent a lot of our hardearned cash saving this for them  taliesin im going to need a little bit of that money to fix my gun too which is very broken  laura how much do you need percy  taliesin i dont know how broken it is  sam our heroes feasts are 1000 bucks each  marisha about how much is 500 pounds worth of gold maybe thats a better question  matt well 50 gold pieces is one pound /town/ so thats about 100 pounds 5000 you said 500 500 would  be you know ten pounds  taliesin we need some platinum  laura oh is there platinum in there were so greedy  matt its mostly gold platinum is not too heavily traded its usually more there arent a  lot of people in the general town and cityscapes of westruun these areas of the country that  carry large volumes of platinum theyre more like intercountry large purchases that are made most  of this has just been gathered from peoples homes from personal stashes and mercantile /none/ store  houses so most of it here is gold  marisha how much did you say was the total again  matt about 78000  sam i feel like we should take 15 to 20  marisha so 20 would be 15000  liam 15s fair  laura is it  liam we put in a lot of work if you wanna do more you can tell the children of westruun  personally  laura no i dont want to put i dont want to put more i want to take less honestly  sam why do you hate /none/ children vex  taliesin theyre very dirty they smell terrible and  ashley is it a terrible idea to let the people decide cause maybe they would give us more  sam the people how hold a vote do you want this money or do you want us to have it  ashley sighs i dont know because maybe some of it may not all be theirs  sam could you pray on it and ask what sarenrae would do  ashley im not going to pray over this money  taliesin i think if we ask them theyre just /town/ going to argue amongst themselves  sam like us  marisha yeah i agree  we would ask an entire town to come to a decision  matt thats 300 pounds worth of gold if you were to put that within the bag of holding thats the  most you could carry  travis thats all right  matt your bag of holding ill say at this point would be full  travis maxed out i could do that plus i could make myself really big for a little bit too  laura all right but thats all were taking /town/  travis okay  laura these people are in need its very hard to say but i dont want people being homeless and  were walking around with a bunch of gold thats  taliesin beyond homeless theyre going to probably have to run so any money we give them will be  money they will use to get out of town to go somewhere else  marisha are we sure theres people capable in town to bring back all this money that we trust  sam sure if they had enough people and enough wagons but however if we /none/ leave all this  gold just sitting here wont brigands come and rob it and pilfer it  laura probably but what are we going to do  sam we can hide it in some stone shit cant you make some stone shit to hide it some sort of  laura oh yeah like a wall or something  sam i dont know like a fake stone wall that they could walk through i dont know  laura that only lasts for a while  marisha i can stone shape like a little no stone shapes permanent  matt yeah /none/ its instant you just impact  marisha okay okay stone shapes permanent so i could stone shape a little cubby and put a little  symbol over it so we know  laura okay but hide it well ill hide the hole so that we tell them where it is  matt okay so as you begin moving and trudging through the gold as you start moving it into that  pile you also discover 25 pounds worth of precious gems most of them cut some of which are  also rough  sam do any of them have identifying /none/ marks like wedding rings or  matt i mean there are a number of gems that look like theyre part of necklaces or rings yes  laura i wonder why hes asking  matt there are a number of gemencrusted rings that would be very very beautiful wedding rings if  they were utilized yes  sam any particularly small ones  laughter  matt there are a number that could fit smaller folked fingers  sam ill take a sapphire  matt okay thats about a 400 gold worth sapphire ring  liam oh this ones nice  matt /none/ so note the 25 pounds worth of gems you could attempt to ascertain their worth later you  dont have the materials nor the actual personal knowledge to figure out exactly how much those gems  are worth at the moment you do also find a bunch of art and fine decor brass and gold statues that  were pulled out of homes some art pieces silverware  sam can i do some sort of arcana check on some of the stuff have we done that already  marisha we have the hunk of quall ill go ahead and here /none/ i hand scanlan the hunk of quall  liam isnt qualls hunk just for qualls stuff or is it for everything  sam it just finds magical things right  liam i thought it was just for his special stuff  marisha it finds things with magical essences  travis scanlan shes metaphorically handing you the quall  marisha here do you want the hunk of quall do you want to hang onto it  sam sure ill quall it  matt okay make an arcana check  sam ooh 20  matt it sparks for a second then goes /dung/ dark again looking at it it seems like whatever it  was designed to find it has found and expended most of its temporary enchantment  laura lame  marisha boo  sam so it doesnt do anything so then ill scan through the stuff looking for magical dope items  matt make an investigation check  laura are there any pretty paintings that grab our attention  matt there are some very pretty paintings  travis were not taking any paintings  laura i could roll it up grog its not your call  travis theyre very heavy  /none/ sam i got a 14 anyone want to help me look for magical scheisse  ashley ill help ill help you look  matt so the armored gnome pike leaps onto the pile of gold coins and eagerly sifts through with  her giant ogreish hands  laughter  ashley i just rolled a one  laughter  ashley theres nothing magical here at all  sam keyleth you wanna help  marisha huh  sam just look for magical shit  marisha im covered in i mean i can  sam grog grog look for magic  travis uh /none/ i rolled a 16  sam laughs thats better than us  laughter  travis hold on  matt his large size allows him to push through large swaths of the pile of coins you do pull  through what appears to be a very very fine ceramic jug that has runes carved along the sides  and it rightfully should have broken under the weight of most of the metal that had been placed  upon it or shifted around  travis its almost all broken anyway  all no  sam do any of us recognise the type /none/ of runes  liam that really seems right up your alley buddy but i think  ashley can i try reading the runes  matt you may go ahead and make an arcana check actually yeah this would be arcana  ashley just arcana check  laura come on  ashley 16  matt 16 its not a specific language theyre all basic magical runes that are used in  transmutation magic youre not too familiar with anything in this realm but transmutation is the  most you can get out of it  marisha hang on wait grog grog /none/ come here  travis okay  marisha i cast create water and i fill the jug with water  matt okay  sam it explodes  travis if i die because of this  laughter  travis explosion  matt whats interesting is as you take the jug from him its empty but you still hear sloshing  even though its empty as you hold it before you you put water into it it swishes around  travis can i tip it upside down  matt yep you tip it upside down and the water spills out  travis anything /none/ else  matt nope  travis can i shake it any more swishing  matt you shake it you still hear the swishing yeah  travis can i put my head in the jug  matt you do muffled it blocks it quite a bit your voice is ringing in your ears  travis can i shake the jug  matt you still hear around you sloshing  travis what is this witchcraft  laughter  marisha do you hear the ocean grog do you hear the ocean  travis echoes no no no no  liam bored vax starts /none/ tossing gold coins off of grogs junk while its on there  travis what what the hell  liam theyre very small  travis oh come on let me break it its obviously broken  all no  ashley can i try taking a sip  matt sure what are you you just take it  ashley just seeing if i can just drink anything in there  matt you tip it nothing comes out of it  ashley aww i thought something cool was going to happen  laura if you reach your hand in it can you touch /none/ the bottom of it  matt yeah you feel the bottom its all dry ceramic  taliesin im going to take the jug im going to put some of the dragon blood thats drying out  in the jug and swirl it around a little bit  matt it swishes around  taliesin and pour it out  matt it pours onto the ground  taliesin its just blood  matt its just blood  marisha i scoop up a little bit of dirt and i put the dirt in the jug  matt you have dirt in the jug /none/  marisha dump it out  sam this is a filthy jug  matt you turn it over and dirt falls across the ground before you  laughter  laura oh what the fuck  sam oh i put some semen in it  laura gross  taliesin no  sam i think thats the magic  travis literally some sailors that are at sea yeah  taliesin a baby comes out now this is your responsibility  matt you go to the docks of emon no youll have to take some time with this to discern what it  /none/ actually does  sam all right well just hang onto it  ashley what if its just like a jug of holding like you could just keep putting stuff in it  laura yeah but everythings been pouring out but theres still something in the bottom of it  taliesin lets take it to an expert well find out later  liam there are smarter people than us  matt you also find amongst this chaos a number of glass shards and you start discerning that there  are a number of empty vials that were shattered and broken across /none/ the floor in this area and  across the coins a bunch of empty vials  laura potions all mixing together  matt a lot of things that were seemingly recently used in the recovery of the large entity however  there is one unbroken vial that you see that contains a cloudy grey oil that swishes around on  the inside some of it tends to seep through the glass almost and then evaporate instantaneously  on touching the air  laura ooh who wants this creepy looking shit  sam ill take it can i have i seen /none/ anything like this before  matt you havent actually  sam dammit can i sniff it to get any clues  matt you sniff it and it smells metallic strangely as you pull the stopper off its not  liquid its more like a thick oil its very viscous and slowly swishes in place as you rotate  the glass  laura i bet gilmore would know what that was  sam ill hang onto this for now it might be massage oil  laura what  sam you never know  matt you never know you do also rummage /none/ through you find another unbroken the glass itself is  cracked a little bit but its still intact what appears to be a small brown silver and gray  layered liquid its like three different layers that are all sediment and separate from each  other based on how its been laying there  laura ahh should we put this inside another glass container so if it breaks its okay  taliesin honestly i think just putting it in the biological  laura the bag of colding  taliesin the bag of colding might be wise  laura all right /none/ layered graybrown potion is what im writing  matt its got layers of brown silver and grey  travis so mostly grey  marisha its like a birthday cake shot  matt kind of and then as you push the last of the coins in this hole that youve made in the  side of the wall to hide it out of the way you do also find at the very bottom of this  what looks like an old book of some kind like a tome its about this big with a heavy thick  leather binding around it /none/  laura can we read it  sam no this could be the spellbook  travis oh yeah dres vinas  marisha dres vinas spellbook  travis abjurist nojas  marisha abjurist noja thats right  sam abjurist nojas does it look like a spellbook have we seen a spellbook before  matt you look through and as you open it up the words are scrambled and as you focus for a  second they seem to reassemble them in common and as you read through the first page has a  large title across the top that says tome /none/ of leadership and influence  liam this is special  laura it is who should read it i want to read it right now  sam well only some of us can read no offense  travis fuck off are there any pictures in the book  matt there are no pictures it is pure text your favorite  travis completely worthless its awful cold  laura if grog looks at it does it reassemble itself in stick figures  matt its interesting you look at the pages and the lines dont make sense to you but for some  /none/ reason you understand the gist of what the content is it goes beyond the barrier of language and  for a second its almost like there are pictures but the pictures are assembled by a bunch of tiny  lines in a row and different shapes that show you what it means  travis see its a book about leadership clearly it wants to communicate something to me  ashley intelligence  travis intelligence right thank you  liam this is like the grognak comic book in fallout is what this is  marisha see i was going to say /none/ how to win friends and influence people  sam as the unofficial leader of the group  laura yeah really scanlan  sam i dont really need the book so perhaps percy should look at it  taliesin i was thinking perhaps keyleth might actually  laura thats true you do have a people to rule both of you do  taliesin yeah keyleth perhaps might want to take this book  i am not leading anyone  marisha thank you scanlan thank you  travis keyleth you wanna trade the book for this stupid vase  sam its not /none/ secret santa were not trading things  laughter  travis fine  marisha i mean i guess because i happen to be holding the vase at the time sure no you can  you can have it  travis i can have the book  marisha no you can have the vase  ashley wait whats the book the book is leadership and what  matt leadership and influence if you guys want to take the evening to kind of look over these  items you could probably discern most of the nature of them  sam okay well lets /none/ do that lets take a look at them overnight  marisha im going to continue eviscerating a dragon  matt you get to the point where you guys late into the night have carved away roughly 40  functional pounds of hide before youre exhausted youre exhausted and theres still plenty of hide  to pull off of but it would take you a week and you can notice the more you go the scent is  changing its almost like the acidic contents of the body are beginning to accelerate  decomposition it is actually essentially now that the /none/ body is no longer living the acidic bile  that it usually utilizes as a weapon is slowly consuming its remains  taliesin im perfectly content with 40  marisha yeah we can make a decent amount of armor with 40 pounds  matt so whoever wants to carry that because its got to be carried because the bag of holding is full  travis ill take it  ashley i can carry some im strong  laura how much does the biological bag hold  matt the biological bag holds 100 pounds  laura i could put some in /none/ there i dont have very much in here its all light  matt okay so there you go  marisha yeah cool cool cool  laura so 40 pounds ill mark that down  matt so 40 pounds of black dragon hide  travis youre carrying around 100 pounds of shit  laura its magic its weightless  matt the bag of colding the bag itself weighs five pounds to her but can contain 100 pounds so  as you guys work through the evening whos looking over which items whos looking over the book  sam im looking over /none/ the book  travis will you stand up there and get me the vase  matt there is the vase for grog  laura was there other things to look at ill look at the vial that i have the layered one  travis gimme gimme  taliesin im going to sit and try and get my gun working again  liam theyre no good for me but i think last week you said something about spears or javelins  or something  matt there are various basic weapons in there but nothing that comes across as anything beyond  /none/ wellcrafted weaponry that was gathered  liam there any shortswords in the pile  matt there are a couple a lot of them have been dinged up and wrecked but there are two regular  shortswords that seem to be functional and not damaged too heavily  liam im going to scoop them up  matt okay so two shortswords  taliesin i dont know how i even feel about that  matt so percy the level of broken that bad news is would require a workshop of some kind even  just basic blacksmithing tools  taliesin i was /none/ going to use the workshop thats in the house  matt okay if you guys want to go and rest in the house then thats doable  sam yes im doing the house  matt okay all of you hop into scanlans mordenkainens magnificent mansion  liam yeah chicken  matt get yourself

travis squash that ooh snip diggity  laura oh shit  ashley 23  matt amazing as your earth elemental form was it displaced about the size an earth elemental would  pikes much smaller form managed to

explosion sound a secondary explosion that sounds dulled and covered until it /none/ hits the air in  a loud cacophonous explosion sound water and smoke and pieces of metal go flying as the kettle  is destroyed you percy suffer  taliesin should have mostly directed down but im aware that some  matt yeah 23 points of bludgeoning and piercing damage from shrapnel and pieces of metal that have  just

the water theres a double splooshing sound as a bear is suddenly placed  magically into the water beneath you at the same velocity causing the water itself to splash  outward in a large column a spray that gently comes down around the sides of the initial splash  impressive a very impressive display  sam impressive and she didnt really use magic so thats good bonus points there  matt trinket eventually comes out of the water growl shaking coat sound shakes off /none/  liam is the judging of this up to artistic interpretation like ice skating  sam thats up to grog  travis well done all

gems /none/ in one hand takes the towel wraps it around as he steps out of the  water with the other and makes his way outside of the spa  taliesin leaving a little trail of blood all the way down the corridor  laughter  sam good game good game  matt all righty  travis well im going to bed  laura all right all right  matt all right you guys go find your way to your respective rooms rest for the

else can have it  travis dont you have a broom you aint going to be climbing much  laura thats true i dont need it i have a broom  taliesin actually i might take it high ground is occasionally very useful for me  laura ive got a broom that flies  taliesin and im not that strong  marisha what was the name of that tome again scanlan  sam tome of leadership and /none/ influence im torn keyleth you have some charisma issues shall we say  marisha uhhuh no keep telling me about myself scanlan today  sam well im just saying that i am quite selfconfident sure of myself some would say  charming  laura some not most  sam and this book would make me unstoppably so  marisha sure  sam so i dont know we could roshambo for it what does the group think  liam i think keyleth should read it shes trying to lead her people  travis yeah roshambo for it  marisha i dont /none/ want to what i dont like wanting things i dont care you  laura who has this is who has charismabased spells  sam me  matt you  liam thats a big fat pause is what that is  matt yeah  sam why dont we think on it  marisha all right well think on it  taliesin to be fair it takes days  sam it takes six days of reading to take effect  laura oh shit so if you read for two days and then pass it off to someone else does it just  /none/ restart  marisha no  taliesin its once a century it works  travis oh shit once a century  taliesin i have a similar book that i used  laura what did you use it on  sam yeah you live for many centuries keyleth you can have it nexties  laughter  taliesin thats actually a very fair point  travis thats kind of perfect  taliesin i was about to say would you like a manual of quickness here for you  laughter  marisha oh for the next century  taliesin so 99 years from now /none/  marisha sure ill hold onto it for that long  travis when were all cold and dead  taliesin i was holding onto it in the hopes of finding somebody longlived to sell it to  sam speaking of old are some of us older than we used to be  travis yeah  marisha are we still old it would have worn off right  matt i would say for the purposes of the travel because you guys had a few days travel from the  actual sphinxs lair towards westruun when you were travellng back you had /none/ the opportunity to  use greater restoration to get rid of it  marisha between pike and i  matt yeah in that time  sam what if we dont want to be any younger  matt then you could have said no and kept it as you go if you wanted to take in your nice salt  and pepper  laura how old are you now scanlan if you keep it  sam i dont know  ashley that salt and pepper hair  sam a girl never tells her age  matt would you want to maintain /none/ your little creeping reed richards going on at the sides there  sam no ill get young again  matt slightly  sam slightly  marisha he said begrudgingly  matt i know  liam set that dial back to 39  matt all right then anything else  marisha what were you going to say percy  taliesin i was thinking perhaps youre not necessarily the person to magically augment your path  marisha thats kind of my hesitance about it i guess  taliesin i had meditated upon the idea for a minute  marisha im honestly kind /none/ of afraid of what kind of leadership things and influence it could  possibly tell me i dont know i dont know i dont know  taliesin laughs  sam i do  marisha you can read it scanlan  sam yes  laughter  taliesin at the very least itll keep him busy for four or five days  marisha thats true  ashley thats true thats true  taliesin because you have to read for 48 hours  laura what if he gets even more charismatic and then he proposes again and he charms you more  ashley /none/ well if hes so charming i just wouldnt be able to help it  laura its possible  marisha i know thats my actually my only other regret is do we want to turn scanlan into a  charm nuclear weapon because thats what well be doing  laura i kind of do want to do that he is super good at talking to people  marisha he is  taliesin and i think theres enough of us that we could all keep each other in check from  liam between grog and scanlan we can solve any problem i /none/ think so beef him up so to speak  marisha tell me what kind of leadership things who wrote that scanlan  sam lao tsu  marisha tell me what kind of leadership skills lao tsu wants to bestow upon you if theres any good  ones pass them along  sam all right ill give you some tips  marisha all right  matt laughs all right you guys finish your breakfast make your way outside of the mansion back  into the dragons den is there anything else you wish to do before you leave as you can /none/ only take  the amount of gold that you retrieved and the items you could farm the rest will have to be left  behind hopefully to be retrieved at some point down the line by either the remnants of westruun or  yourselves  liam ill just say that ive attuned to all my old shit while everyone was swimming  matt okay cool  laura yeah yeah i carved a pretty little heart on the side of one of the boots just to make it  extra girly  matt make a perception check  liam i would /none/ just think that meant you love me  laura maybe i do  liam uh that is a 39  laura laughs what  liam 17 plus perception is did i get it wrong am i too tired ive had a long day people lets  say 29  matt did you take perception as one of your  liam yeah  matt oh then yeah okay you take the boots and you put them on and immediately theres a heart  there and youre like pained hmm that probably means she loves me  liam no i like it /none/ its fine  matt yeah at first youre like sh oh no its cool  liam i dont know what youre thinking its beautiful  matt all right you guys are back in the dragons lair is there anything else you wish to do  taliesin were going to make sure we walk around the trap that is still active in the front  travis right  matt make your way back through the tunnel that you had carved before  liam have to avoid that old magic  travis is there any lasting damage from the acid burns  /none/ matt thankfully through magic healing and other means there was no scarring the tattoos and beard  that were partially destroyed  travis i was going to ask beard  matt yeah the beards a little bit reduced from the sheer volume of acid that was thrown at your  face but since healing magic was applied shortly thereafter the little bit of the beard that began  to singe it stopped that process so you still have some facial hair just may have to grow back  to its full majesty  travis i may need a haircut in /none/ a day or two  taliesin ooh can you stone shape something for me  i would like to have keyleth stone shape and use one dragon scale if you would be so kind  or actually one tooth if that would be all right  marisha sure tooth me  taliesin i would like to leave the vm seal on the side of the cavern  laura gasps  taliesin and just written in what would a dragon understand  matt draconic  taliesin draconic  liam we have somebody who can do that  taliesin one down and /none/ lets embed the tooth into the rock  sam ooh  travis yes i like it  taliesin we might as well  laura i like it i like it  marisha so i do the vox machina crest  matt okay  marisha and then one down who speaks draconic  matt all right so you get with her you scribble onto the ground what that phrase would look like  you go ahead and copy that and you embed it permanently and immediately into the side of the stone  liam and i said bitch  matt all /none/ righty you guys make your way down gatshadow through the bramblewood forest to  westruun itself as you hit the base of the mountain start getting towards the edge of the  forest you see a pillar of smoke rising up from that direction  marisha from westruun  matt a relatively thick pillar of smoke a few actually  laura oh no  marisha wait what  sam uhoh theyve already attacked  travis no we go fast we go  matt all right you guys rush through the remainder of the bramblewood come out into the  field /none/ and are met by what looks like a series of fires that are out in the open field north of  westruun not within the actual city you see these are pyres the dead of the umbrasyl battle have  been set aflame being given off the proper heroes sending it is a standard afterbattle remembrance  of those who fell for the herd you see standing amongst them the twelve surviving members of the  battle many of them pretty badly scarred from the encounter but alive nonetheless bandaged and  kind of taking a moment of silence you /none/ do see of that group as well zanror and worra are there  they havent noticed you yet and standing behind them all one large aimless stone golem with a big  chain hanging out of its chest just standing there  marisha fassbender  sam who controls him  liam no one at the moment  matt yep  laura oh you took it off  liam i took it off  marisha but you have the circlet still  liam of course i have the circlet yeah but  taliesin ill take it if no one else does /none/  liam sure  travis can i find my way to zanror is his is she his wife his woman  matt his mate worra yeah theyre both next to each other and as you get closer you notice most  of them have gathered their belongings they have travel packs they have taken sacks and whatever  they could to bring whatever belonged to them and it looks like they are getting ready to move you  see shale a bit behind them as well who has also taken some small supplies with her one good arm  and /dung/ putting it over her shoulder and tying it to her armor before she grabs her staff again so  you walk over to zanror and worra zanror looks over to you as you approach his arm still around  worras shoulder its good to see you survived grog  travis yeah did more than that actually found our way up to the cave where umbrasyl was left  him in pieces  matt as shale told us the bearded king she said  travis laughs a word of advice if as youre finding your way out of town you were /dung/ to stop by  a certain cave there might be some things for you to pick up  laura gro  liam i take my sister put my hand over her mouth and i drag her back about 30 feet  matt he gives you a look and looks to worra looks to her belly  laura whispers thats for the people of westruun  matt and goes appreciate that well take what we can  travis your little one you take care of him her it  matt i will  travis all right  matt do you want /none/ to come with us we know we cast you out once but were not like that  anymore the herds dead we go to find prosperity with the rivermaw a people we wronged and were  probably going to spend some time making it up to them for my fathers infractions youre one of  us now and wed be honored to have you  travis im honored truly i am but i lost a family all those years ago and while i will  always think fondly of you i have a new family now and i must stay /none/ and guard them with my life  matt i understand well im not very good at these parting pleasantries he puts his arm out  matt and travis crashing sound  sam stereo  travis come on it blew your hair back when it happened  matt yeah a little bit little bit  travis magnavox like squeal sound  matt you be safe you find your way head north of the silvercut youre always welcome in our tents  travis ill keep that in mind travel safely  matt he goes ahead and takes up his bags shale takes /dung/ up her staff comes up to you and well  see each other again grog of this im sure  travis yeah hm totally sure heh you look out for that other eye now dont lose the other  because then youll just be like scared noise in the dark  matt as youre doing that she smacks you on the nose with the staff ill be fine and she walks  away with a smile on her weathered crooked face zanror yells out come we move west everyone  turns their heads and gather their things and they walk /dung/ by as all the soldiers walk by those  wounded and not to each of you they bow their heads in respect and you swear you hear a couple  of murmured thank you as they all solemnly make their way out west away from westruun  liam is it just the remainder of the herd  matt mmhmm  liam herd leader we trust you will leave something in that cave for the people of this  town something to help them recover  matt zanror turns to you and says theres very little in our lifestyle that really /none/ has use of  this coin just enough to make it from place to place if need be besides occasionally we need  supplies something to trade with im not like my father this ive learned in recent months  liam prosperity on your family  matt hm looks to grog your family as well turns around and continues to walk  laura youre lucky hes nice grog  travis what what  laura offering all the gold to the herd instead of the people of westruun  travis i didnt offer all of it i said there was something /none/ to pick up he might have grabbed a  bunch of mud what are you so upset about  liam he meant well  travis yeah  matt as you guys make your way uh where are you heading  sam into westruun  travis yeah yeah yeah  marisha is the gold pile trap still there  matt it is yes  taliesin its sprung we have to pick it up  laura is our gold still there  matt your gold is not there  groaning  laura its a good thing i only put a little bit /none/ in  liam im going to go take like five minutes im going to kneel down and sort of meditate in front  of one of the pyres  matt okay laughing but what you do notice ironically while the gold is still there its  scattered about because theres been an explosion where the gold was left behind  laura gasps oh shit  ashley oops  laughter  ashley my bad i made a bomb  matt nearby there is a groove in the dirt that is dragged on for about four five hundred feet  before there /none/ appears to be a body at the edge  liam dead dwarf  marisha its a dwarf  matt no its not its the gentleman who disappeared as you let him out of prison  shouting  travis that son of a bitch that thieving bastard  laura he deserves it  marisha the fucking asshole that peaced out  travis blackfoot what was his name  matt oran blackfoot  laura i knew he was going to go for the gold thats what he thought he was going to do  matt as soon as you guys left he /town/ seized the opportunity  laughter  travis good kill good kill  ashley all right all right all right  liam im taking a moment to pay my respects to the dead  matt okay  marisha i do the same  taliesin im attuning fassbender and working on getting the chain removed from him  marisha keyleth takes a minute to druidcraft some wildflowers around the pyre  matt okay as you guys are taking this break vex you notice a small group of individuals  walking from the town in your direction make a perception check  laura /dung/ i bent my paper high voice 17  matt okay you glance over and best you can make out some appear to be armored some appear  to be just carrying sacks and goods theres a cart being dragged behind with two beasts of  burden affixed to the front a set of horses and at the front of them you see a human male wearing  chain mail with a heavy shield to one side walking up and approaching hes mid to late 40s  big black and graystreaked beard pulled into two points wild crazylooking dark hair also /none/ gray  streaked sundappled nose he walks up with his hand in the air  laura oi friend  matt can we go ahead and have our guest enter  laura ooh  liam i know that guy  cheers  sam sorry for the wait  matt we had to have a hot spring episode  marisha very important cannonball competition we had to get to  patrick im sorry that i was laughing loud enough for the mics to pick it up some people on twitter  were saying that they heard me laugh  matt thats fine /none/ patrick rothfuss joining us today  sam fabulous writer good person  patrick thats not me  matt so as youre walking up from the city of westruun carrying behind you the group of  eagertoleave refugees that have gathered around you you notice the burning spires and you see  the remnants of the horde leaving westward behind the group of heroes that you all had feared had  gone to the top of the mountain to meet their doom they stand before you alive and resting and  as you approach to hail them one of them the /town/ halfelf female hails you  laura sir how fares stuttering how are you doing  sam charisma  laura give me the book give me the book  travis amazing couldnt have done any better  laura whats happening in the town are you leaving  patrick how many people are left in town and how many have come with me  matt in town theres probably a couple hundred that are scattered throughout most of them have  left the party has sent them out but many individuals that they didnt get to have still  been holed up /none/ in their homes you have with you right now 20 people and these are the folks  that have congregated around you to figure out a plan of what to do  patrick okay  sam whats with all the questions narc  laughter  patrick i will admit i did not expect to see you folk again  laura well were here  patrick whats happened  laura you know that dragon  patrick i noticed the dragon  laura gone killed destroyed vox machina  laughter  laura give me the book  sam nope  patrick i /town/ dont know what to say i was expecting to have to bury some more bodies  laura thankfully that is not the case and you are smart with leaving town  patrick well the town itself hasnt decided exactly what to do how much to rebuild or  whether or not its even worth it  but now at least we can make some plans  laura definitely  sam oi whats your name  patrick oh my name is kerr  sam kerr  laura like care bear  marisha is that with a c or a k  /town/ patrick laughs with a k  marisha okay kerr i like it  sam and tell us about yourself if you dont mind  patrick i have been here in this town for a while i settled down after i had a bit of an  adventurous youth  sam ooh i like  travis yeah me too  patrick how old do these guys look  matt they look younger than you they look like a bunch of young upstarts for the most part  patrick theyre puppies right  matt theyre puppies but looking close up you can /town/ see weathered experiences in their eyes  patrick they came back from the dragon but still these are like kids right  matt from your perspective yeah  patrick yeah  sam im an adult man  matt whos just roughly past your knee  patrick i welcome you back to what is left of the town and i offer my thanks and thanks on behalf  of those of us that are left  laura are you responsible for these pyres  patrick the town has been pulling together and we have been doing what we can with what /none/ we have  marisha and whats your position been in westruun  patrick oh i dont have a position in the city im just the smith  laura youre a blacksmith  travis you make weapons  patrick yes  laura armor  patrick armor  sam percy  taliesin well i make things theyre not  sam maybe you guys could collab on a joint project  taliesin smithing and gadgetry while i can see how to the layman they look very similar are in  fact quite different  sam i actually might have a project for you /none/ if we have a moment  marisha okay before we start hitting him up for work  taliesin is this everybody you could round up to get out of the city  patrick well this is everyone who was interested in coming out on this particular expedition  travis oh yeah what is your expedition  patrick mostly exploratory like i said we just didnt have any information at all i didnt know  if we were going to be burying more bodies or dealing with an increasingly angry dragon  laura well the dragon in the mountain is dead /none/ but there are increasingly angered dragons in  other cities that will probably be coming here to retaliate  patrick that will be coming here  sam possibly  laura more than likely  marisha probably  taliesin maybe  marisha we dont know  travis no no chance  laughter  sam actually this raises an important question what do the people of westruun do at this point  do they rebuild do they go underground do they leave and abandon the city  liam its a huge question yes what do you think personally what is this small /town/ group that  youre leading whats your plan  patrick i offered to come along with them in case they needed a strong arm i dont speak for the  town i just know most of the people involved and i wanted to make sure they stayed safe but the  truth is theres a lot of people who have nothing to rebuild and nothing to rebuild it with and if  there might be dragons coming back i dont know  travis well kerr pike and i are both from westruun yeah yep  ashley ive seen you before /none/ do you know wilhand my greatgreatgrandfather  laura great great  ashley greatgreat yeah two greats not just one  matt a tiny hunched over gnomish gentleman a little absentminded but friendly enough keeps to  himself  laura likes to drink  patrick ah  ashley yes you probably have had some drinks with him before  patrick a little bit and i havent met you but ive heard of you  travis oh yeah  patrick yeah  travis what have you heard  patrick i heard that you were a good member of the community  travis /none/ yep thats me  sam nope you are incorrect  travis totally  ashley he was and is but were just never home  travis grog grog is my name  liam kerr do you have a sense of how many people are left in the city roughly  patrick maybe as many as a couple hundred  laura oh thats it  marisha thats not a lot  patrick a lot of people have been leaving but some people cant  travis well look i would just like to put this forward westruun is their home its pikes home /none/  its my home and if you start running you never really stop  sam but where are they going to stay ive been down to the sewers and theres crazy giant  creatures down there  travis well you can treat it like a weather shelter if the dragons come we set up an early  warning system they go underground but this is their home  taliesin heres an interesting thing to contemplate about this whole problem is that we  have three dragons still at large three dragons who have probably found cities of their own so /none/  the chances that theyre going to come back and take time away from their own city to go look at  one thats in theory already taken over is very thin and if they are traveling then theyre  going to travel to cities that havent been plundered yet  laura thats true this one has been plundered  taliesin this is no less or more theres a risk either way its just the risk of running or the  risk of staying  sam also the dragons know that the last dragon who came here died  marisha /none/ i think the dragons motives have probably shifted by now and where the dragons  might not be interested in plundering anymore instead might be interested in any city that we  are in  taliesin which i imagine were leaving soon anyway  liam yeah they might not believe wed be here but they also might try to  travis kerr are you an honest man  patrick ive been called an honest man  sam i insight check him  travis can i insight check oh yeah you do that  laughter  matt you may both make /none/ insight checks  sam 19  travis high voice four  taliesin if you whisper to grog its going to make me really happy yes  sam he just said you fart  taliesin mightily  matt excuse me for just a minute  sam what was this about loot crate  travis three dollars off if you use lootcratecomcriticalrole next week  marisha but thats no secret  sam i trust him with my life i pledge my allegiance to you sir  travis you just dabbed to him  marisha scanlan literally hasnt said that to me in /none/ the entire three years ive known him  sam what was your name again  taliesin scanlan just found out that kerr has a daughter is what he found out  travis wow you pledge your life to him jeez  marisha kerr you said you were an adventurer several years ago  patrick many years ago many years ago ive lived here ive lived here a lifetime at this point  marisha did you have a party that you traveled with as well  patrick i did  marisha would we happen to know any of them allura asum /none/  patrick no that was a long time ago and id be very surprised if youd heard any of the stories  from back then i will say though from what i know about dragons that perhaps vengeance might  not be outside a reasonable expectation there might not be anything here for them to plunder but  marisha but no one likes having their ass handed to them  patrick and these creatures are old and intelligent and powerful and they stay that way  by striking fear into people and sighs as much as i hate to leave /none/ my own home i dont know who  will be able to help my people if any other things like this happen  marisha we cant be everywhere at once  liam what about the sewers  sam well we were down there and there was horrible creepy things  liam we could help with that  sam we could clear out the sewers  marisha but thats not indefinite  travis no its not  marisha theyll be back  laura the only other option is  taliesin theres the traveling band by the river  laura split the /none/ city up set them on different paths  liam theres whitestone  taliesin whitestone is rapidly becoming a very large target  laura very quickly becoming noticeable i think  liam ever been to vasselheim  patrick refugees are often very unwelcome too and most of the people here did not have much left  to lose before they lost it  laura we have claim to the gold that was stolen its up in the mountain its just hard to get down  taliesin someone honest is going to have to come and help divvy it up amongst the /none/ survivors  patrick we can look for an honest person  marisha but if all of the survivors are evacuating the city  patrick we could probably i know enough people to put together a group of carters to go up there  and start fetching stuff down  matt yeah and the people that have gathered around you are people that have been around you  most of the time youve been in the city or at least have known you long enough to the point  where they themselves are also likeminded so you can trust most of /none/ the folks that have walked with  you out towards the pyres  patrick ill say excuse me for just a minute and ill walk off and ill chat with them a little  bit so you can see that im pointing up ill do a little talk off with them so you can talk about  me behind my without me  sam i like this guy  travis you do  laura why do you pledge yourself to him  sam i just feel like hes an honest man hes a good guy hes got a nice twinkle /none/ in his eye and i  recognize that as a sign of honesty because i have a similar feature  laura you do ive never noticed a twinkle in your eye  sam yeah the light has to hit it just  laura no its a crusty from the morning you might just yeah  taliesin how do you get glitter in there  travis that seems like such a shame i mean shouldnt we ask the people of westruun if they  want to stay or go  sam well theres only 200 we could have a huge meeting /town/ and put it to a vote  travis a town hall thing  laura why not  marisha but he said some people were incapable of leaving there might be elderly and sick here that  cant travel  sam is there a way to hide the city with magic weve seen that done before  laura can we make it look like its already been burned down  taliesin it has already been burned down  matt laughs  taliesin that wont be hard at all  laura can we hide  liam cant they have sentries and a /none/ shelter in the sewers they could clear out part of it and  have sentries every night and any time a dragon comes they just go underground and wait wait it out  taliesin i dont think this is a terrible i think this is a pretty reasonable idea  laura what do you think grog pike  travis thats what i said  ashley i feel like its a good idea  travis yeah i dont  marisha hang on hold the phone hold the phone  sam we could spend a few days here and get them started /none/ before we go on to our next thing  travis its so hard to find shelter and protection thats not a city where youre  unwelcome in the first place  taliesin well this is an unwelcome world at the moment  laura we could leave fassbender here to help protect everyone  sam yes i guess if we gave him away but we need him  taliesin do we need him  liam hes going to slow us down  laura how are we going to get fassbender anywhere with us  sam tell him to walk  travis /none/ are we returning the band  marisha yeah quall did want the circlet at some point its not necessarily ours to give away  laura qualls evil  taliesin is he  marisha selfish maybe  taliesin we are under contract technically  laura this is true  marisha what were you going to say pike  ashley we could just leave it with wilhand  marisha we could leave it with wilhand actually  ashley and then we could tell quall  liam oh quall we didnt know where you were we couldnt find you we left it with /town/ wilhand  ashley we wanted to leave it in one place just in case we see you again  sam is that your lying voice  liam sorry buddy  patrick what is the general atmosphere in town are people just done  travis yeah right im fucking over this shit  matt best that you can ascertain a lot of people are scared because they were separated from their  families a large bulk of people left south to kymal which is the nearest township to westruun  that feasibly could take in refugees they left directly after the /none/ dragon attack even before the  herd was there when the herd came in the maybe ten percent 15 percent of people that stayed  behind were then captured some of them were killed as they fought back many were enslaved and  brutalized and a number of them did escape thanks to this groups efforts so id say those that are  left behind theyre eager to see their families theyre probably eager to leave for the time  being some of them do want to stay just because theyre stubborn but the majority seems  interested in not /town/ being in a place that could be a target for more dragon attacks as rumors have  come back that there is more than just the black dragon and many of them recall the red the  green and the white that came with the initial onslaught that tore through the city or it  wouldve been the green and the white  patrick okay yeah so ill wander back and i say my friends here are willing to go on a  retrieval mission im assuming you folks could use some rest and the hospitality of the town  /none/ isnt what it used to be but im sure a lot of people would be very glad to see you have you set  up protections did you hide the treasure  laura we did we did its hidden in a cubby with a little mark on it  sam well give you instructions  patrick sketch out something  taliesin including a little walk around  laura oh yeah the walk around is important  travis but there are stuff out there in the woods there are things  sam hes a strong man  patrick and ive got /none/ these are the more capable these folks can go out on their own  matt a number of them can yeah some of them were there for general visual support  carrying things forth and stewards that have taken up arms because they have to but youre  essentially the strongest of a group of relatively capable individuals  travis id hate to send you into anything that all of a sudden got a bit too nasty i see you  wearing chain mail if i may what is your weapon of choice  patrick im partial i was partial /none/ to the warhammer  travis ooh i reach out to shake his hand i like your choice  ashley kerr do you know how to make armor be quiet  laughter  patrick thats probably the first laugh you get ive been there i lived there a long time we  could talk shop about that  ashley i love talking shop lets do it  patrick ill set up a little expedition and ill send people out knowing that a lot of these folks  that are here are going to head out theyre going to need resources and /none/ based on what theyve said  my team can go out and get some of this treasure  matt yeah based on the description theyve said and the sheer volume thats there they end up  taking four carts that are capable of doing a somewhat treacherous mountain journey with the  strong individuals you send up as well i dont know if you wanted to go up with them or stay  behind  patrick it sounds reasonably clear well send up a good group with spare parts and theyre all  craftsmen here theyre all farmers they can /none/ fix a cart if it breaks  travis is there any way for them to contact you if shit goes down while theyre up there if we  need to go in as the cavalry to the rescue  patrick are there any  sam we can send one of the stones with them  laura groans  patrick anybody with cantrippy message sending  matt unfortunately anybody with any modicum of arcane practitioning capability left  patrick they beat feet long ago yeah  matt as soon as shit hit the fan they were like nope  patrick i /none/ think at this point its people that are stubborn and with really low intelligence  scores are the only folks left so the wizards went right away  taliesin its appropriate on occasion to leave people to a modicum of risk life is risky its  perfectly reasonable to send people on themselves  liam can we steer them away from the area where we ran into those basilisks  laura yes we will tell you about the basilisks  taliesin theyre locals they should know  matt well the basilisks were far south that was in the frostweald  /none/ laura oh never mind  matt as far as you know they were nowhere near the bramblewood thankfully  laura so what should we do here clear out the sewers because thats what was said  sam wait theres three options for these people and they have to decide for us they can stay here  and live in the sewers they can go to whats it called  matt kymal  sam kymal where theyre still accepting refugees or they can wander off into the desert  taliesin well theres also that group of people wandering around theres that /none/ group  sam thats what im saying  travis hey guys so remember the farmer outside and then he turned into a scarecrow  marisha yes we remember  travis i found his daughter  sam oh where is she  laura did you tell her  travis no no i didnt know what to do she looked like a deer in the headlights  laura where is she  travis she was in the prison with abjurist noja and blackfoot whos now dead whats her name  again  matt amelia  travis amelia really sweet  marisha did /town/ you send her towards refugees  sam is she around  travis i brought her out before we took the fight to the dragon so i think shes still in the town  but i dont want to tell her  laura we should tell her grog  travis yeah i know and maybe give her a little coin but pike do you think maybe you could  ashley tell her  travis yeah  ashley yeah  travis okay  liam do i remember where he is  matt where reginald is yeah  liam i head off that /town/ way  matt okay its directly west of the town so its pretty much south of where you guys are  currently standing because the drop point was northwest of the city he is still affixed  liam i bring him back here  travis make him sound real brave you know paint a good picture when you talk to her  taliesin he was real brave  laura theres only about 200 people left do you know someone named amelia  matt you know of amelia though you no you did see her last night you hadnt seen her /town/ in a  while she was one of the people that was still in the town she was peripheral to the battle with  the dragon but fled as soon as she saw it unfortunately dragons have that effect on people  she was a little shamed by it but you calmed her down but you do know that shes safe and  reachable  patrick yeah shes around  laura where is everyone staying within the town are they scattered about or are they staying in a  central location  patrick weve organized places for people to sleep /none/ if they dont have places for themselves  its makeshift but because its been a couple of days at this point  matt yeah its been almost two days since the initial encounter  patrick right so weve got triage camps set up i will say some people are going to stay no  matter what and they have the right to stay and thats their choice i imagine some people will  come back and rebuild here but most people they are ready to go they miss their families  laura an entire city  taliesin we can build /town/ a dragon shelter at the very least that is something we can do  marisha but these people are prisoners here they feel like theyre prisoners in their own home and  thats not a home  travis then we let them make their choice  taliesin theyll do what theyre going to do but we can give them an option if things get hairy  laura lets make our way toward them then  matt okay you guys make your way towards town the largest concentration of survivors that youve  been keeping tabs on actually arent that far /none/ from wilhands home in the area where most of the  temples are constructed which is generally considered one of the oldest and most protected  areas of westruun there are two inns that are basically now ramshackle homes for sleep theres  bedspreads across the entire floor all the tables and chairs have been moved out and its now just  a giant room where people who had their homes destroyed come and sleep not because its  comfortable but because theres comfort and safety in numbers people have gathered what  belongings they still had that are worth /town/ anything or they might need for a journey many of  them are still gathering bits of dried food and fruit and whatever preparing for whatever the  next step of their travels may be but you probably have the bulk of the people in the town  other than a few older very stubborn folks that are like im going to stay in my home the  folks that stayed at mt st helens where youre like come on guys seriously  laughter  patrick theres always some  matt theres always some but yeah so as you approach /tavern/ and the door swings open to the first  tavern as you introduce them too a few of the folks perk up a few children who couldnt sleep  look over two of the kids that recognize you run up uncle kerrek they run up and grab the side  of your legs your chain mail clanks and you pick them up  ashley i look around for wilhand  matt wilhand is not amongst this group wilhand probably stayed safe within his home which kept  him safe up to this point so far  travis do we see /none/ amelia  matt looking about yes you do see amelia she is asleep right now though  sam wake her up tell her her dads dead  marisha hey hey its really important i need to tell you right now  ashley we see her  matt you see her shes asleep its later in the day from the travel you guys went down the  mountain to even get here after you woke up in the morning you spent most of the day getting back to  westruun so youre getting pretty close to sunset the group has been /tavern/ set off for the  evenings travel toward the top of gatshadow she appears to have fallen asleep early  patrick ill start a few things and ill spread the word everybody could really use a bit of a  party here we dont have many resources but im betting theres enough liquor for everybody to get  good and drunk tonight  matt oh yeah  patrick thats the resource theres always an abundance of at this point well kind of put the  word out and honestly i dont need to organize it i can just say dragons /none/ dead and they did  it were going to throw them a party tonight and im just going to let that happen  matt and with each chain of that word spreading the energy immediately lifts up within the room  and the building adjacent and folks that were either resting or in a state of perpetual  anxiousness suddenly brighten up even with the dirtsmeared faces you can see smiles poking out  as people begin coming into the room to see those who slew the dragon that threatened them people  start coming up and shaking your hands /town/ individuals who havent seen you guys for years  people that lived down the street and gave you a passing hello in the younger days of your youth  are now coming up to you with a look of absolute appreciation and thanks just as that energy picks  up the wine and the ale begin to go throughout the area as stores of them beneath the taverns  that were not found by the herd as there were only so many members of the herd and a larger  number of actual inns and taverns throughout the town people /none/ start grabbing cups even some of the  kids start coming up with cups and the parents are like hmm a little its new years you  can have a sip  taliesin its medieval times everybody drinks  matt without much worry at that point everyones getting nice and liquored up and happiness has  ensued some folks pull out some meager instruments there arent a lot of extremely  practiced bards so your ears tweak a little at the sound of imperfect music but there is honesty  and joy coming from it so you choose not to /town/ lend any sort of constructive criticism to the  performers  laughter  taliesin you sent the last of the decent bards out of town its all on you  laura can i hang out outside i want to keep my eye on the skies  matt yeah not a worry go ahead and make a perception check  taliesin i was about to say i was going to join you ive had my fill of party  liam yes im sure you were  laura wait what is that 32  liam thats okay  matt 32 all right /dung/ you look about the sky it is clear the dark clouds that had loomed towards the  top of gatshadow have since blown away the starry night sky now spreads infinitely above you and  for the first time in a long time knowing that the immediate danger is no longer chasing you you  take a minute to appreciate the sheer beauty of the view that westruun always had this brief  moment to allow yourself to exhale helps remind you what all this is worth and the importance of  moments like this you can hear the laughter /tavern/ behind you within the inn you can hear the music  you can hear the kids chuckling and telling jokes people clinking glasses together and in this tiny  little microcosm of a moment here you let yourself silently smile and really know what all  of this is worth  taliesin im going to join  marisha about that time i reach and grab percys hand before he leaves the door percy percy  taliesin what  marisha this is giving me a lot of anxiety theres a lot of people here  taliesin is it about your feelings /none/ about vax is that the whole problem right now  marisha no  taliesin i really dont  marisha theres so many people calling us heroes  taliesin yes  marisha were not heroes  taliesin we pretty much are actually i hate to tell you this  marisha no were not were terrible people were terrible people why are they telling us  this oh god oh god if i have to shake one more townspersons hand oh god i feel like i  was cursed i was cursed i dont want any of this i dont want any /tavern/ of this  patrick do i spot that  matt you do as you guys are having this conversation kerr walks over with a rosy grin on  his face  patrick is this your first time  marisha hyperventilating hi im keyleth do you want to step outside  laura i come back inside  patrick lets step outside  marisha okay  matt you guys pass vex as she steps back into the tavern passing you guys  laura pat her on the back drunk already  marisha no not enough  taliesin panic attack  matt as /none/ you step outside with kerr the cold night air comforting to you hitting your face  hitting your lungs it helps the breathing slow and you have a moment of control over your  emotions  marisha groan does the nausea always happen is that always a thing  patrick is it the people or is it the fact that you have finally realized how pointless it all is  surprised laughter  marisha maybe its the fact that i feel like ive been lied to my entire god damn life and its all  crashing down upon me right /none/ now  sam shes druish  marisha so druish so yeah you could say how about a little bit of column a and a little bit of  column b  patrick yeah  marisha yeah  patrick yeah  marisha yeah how did you deal with it  patrick i found other places where i could do good things  marisha really  patrick yeah  marisha like what  patrick like i make wagon couples the thing that hooks  marisha oh i dont know exactly what you said  patrick you have a wagon  marisha sure /none/  patrick and then you have a horse  marisha right yeah  patrick and then something needs to hook the horse to the wagon  marisha got you  patrick and if you have a bad one of those it breaks and so people need good ones of those  marisha i dont know at all what you just told me im not going to lie but i think i get the  message  patrick im guessing that you are bothered by the fact that no matter what you do you seem to end  up destroying more /none/ things than you fix  marisha yes jeez youre like the first person no one else gets it  patrick they dont get it do they  marisha no they dont  patrick no  marisha is that it thats it we will destroy everything we touch we will cause more harm than  good we will carve a path of destruction and make it seem like were doing good and then people  will worship us because they think were heroes when in the back of my head im thinking about all  the death that has come by /none/ our hands  patrick that can be a lot of it im not going to lie to you about that  marisha yeah you know kerr youre not really helping make me feel better about this im not  going to lie  patrick well i imagine that your friends will tell you a lot of things that would make you feel  real good but im not one for short term solutions i think that youre right i think that  youve obviously put a lot of thought into this  marisha so much thought i swear ive gotten /none/ nosebleeds keep going thats beside the point  patrick and ive known people like you before people who are very sensitive to this sort of  thing i have been the sort of person you are and its not simple your friend who lived here for a  while the big one whats his name  marisha grog yeah  patrick right he doesnt have this he has the opposite of this its all good for him right  and youre kind of jealous arent you  marisha i so badly wish i could have what he has  patrick /none/ but somebody has to look at the big picture and sometimes thats us and usually its  unpleasant but somebody needs to do it  marisha so youre saying this is my curse this is my duty  patrick im saying that long pause im saying that if you arent careful it will rip you  apart from the inside but thats not a longterm solution thats just another piece of  destruction you need to find a way to live with the fact that you do what you can because thats  what you can control and sometimes bad /none/ things happen anyway and so you just have to decide  where youre going to pick your hill you find your hill everybody gets one hill and you plant  your flag and you can die on that one but you have to be careful because you only get one if  youre really unlucky you get more than one  marisha and what if the ultimate problem is that i feel like ive had zero control from the start  since birth i didnt want any of this i didnt want my abilities i didnt know i was special /town/  until now and i so desperately just want to be normal i want to go back to being ignorance and bliss  patrick then i do have a momentary shortterm solution for you  marisha shoot  patrick its actually there and i will get you another one  laughter  patrick it will help a little bit for now it will smooth out some of the rough edges long  enough for us to talk for a while because ive been down this road okay the thing is youre  not wrong and youre not crazy but its /none/ not hopeless either  marisha okay thank you  patrick ill do maybe one of these it feels like she wants one of these  marisha yeah yeah  patrick i can read that  marisha i give in yeah yeah you know kerr  patrick yes  marisha even surrounded  sam he stabbed you in the back  laughter  liam the chroma conclave sends its regards  laughter  marisha so game of thrones  matt as he brings you into a warm hug and at first there is the resistance because this is a  person /none/ you dont know  marisha yeah and my headdress is a little wonky  matt a little wonky due to the drink due to not concentrating however as much as you travel with  your friends this stranger has seemingly come to you with more wisdom and understanding of your  continuous predicaments than anybody has in a long time if at all and you give into the hug and  realize just how nice it is to have somebody understand  marisha i was pretty much going to say that in character but yeah thats pretty much what i /none/ feel  matt sorry  marisha no no thats i wasnt yeah yeah i tell kern  sam kern  marisha car kerr  matt somewhere in that neighborhood  marisha care bear i tell kerr even surrounded by friends i often feel so alone thank you for  being a friend even though we just met  patrick i get that  matt he brings you in gets you another drink  patrick actually ill bring another drink out to her  matt oh perfect all right  marisha its crowded inside  taliesin i stumble outside for a /none/ bit as well at this point  sam meanwhile im telling my table a story about how i won a cannonball contest last night  matt they are enraptured  sam it was in a dragons lair i was amazing  laughter  laura is amelia awake at this point  matt amelia has woken up due to the sound and noise and shes wandering about with a drink in  her hand now  ashley all right well walk over to her  travis ill stay with you but just behind you  laura amelia  matt hi yes /none/ thank you again for releasing me from the terrible stocks i really appreciate  that thank you for everything youve done for westruun  laura well thank you for everything youve done ive heard amazing things about you and your  family  matt were meager folk we come from very simple roots i and she takes a big long sip of her  flagon sets it down on the table and wipes her mouth truth be told i as soon as i saw that  dragon i ran straight away i didnt you guys are the heroes i didnt /none/ do anything  laura i sit down next to her  ashley i sit down next to her too whispers should we just wait till the morning  laura we have to do it right now so we knew your father is reginald  matt yes have you seen him  laura yes he i take her hands one of the bravest men ive ever had the honor of meeting  matt theres recognition in her eyes her head pulls back a bit her expression goes stoic as she  sinks in the wordless reality that youve just bestowed upon /none/ her  laura i know this can be i know how hard this is to hear but none of this would have happened  none of this celebration would be possible without him he sacrificed himself so that all of us  could live and he spoke your name in the end he wanted nothing more than for you to be taken care of  matt long pause that sounds like dad wipes her eyes  laura would you like to pray pike  ashley i dont know if youre a woman of faith but  matt what faith do /none/ you belong to  ashley i follow sarenrae  matt then for the night as do i she reaches over and takes her flagon and the tears are  streaming down her face in spite of her smile and she looks to you both and looks to you to  reginald to dad  travis to reggie  ashley to reggie  matt and she starts weeping into her hands  travis amelia you should also know your father was a man of a few tricks he told us that he had  been saving this up for whenever you /town/ were old enough but i think you should have it now i hand  her 400 gold pieces  matt she looks up for a moment how how did they took everything  laura he hid it  matt this could help a lot of us okay  travis i think he knew you would do well with it  laura dear theres more coming to the town you take care of yourself  matt deep breath well take care of each other i think thats what hed want  travis aye  matt she grabs her flagon again and /tavern/ takes a big old sip sets it down her eyes are dried a little  bit she wipes the last away  travis i pour my flagon into hers  matt she laughs and drinks of it again definitely embraced the idea that shes going to  get really drunk tonight she begins joining in singing with the music and the rest of the party  picks up as the celebration once again fills the air the rest of the folks gathering around  birds tweeting dont know why there were birds in that track  laughter  ashley is /none/ it morning  matt there will be a lot of partying through the night so probably its an eventuality however  we will take this moment to take a quick break to the restroom we will return here for the next bit  of this adventure so well be right back here in a few minutes guys stick around  cheering  break  matt welcome back so as you return here bellies full the evening of drinks rabblerousing and  stress release through conversation and laughter carries through until the morning light comes  everyone wakes up extremely hungover /none/ but in a way that is wellearned and still worthy of the  evening that transpired before it you all come to consciousness about midday at this time now  laura whoa  matt you all slept in after what happened  liam i actually spent the night in a field with reginald  sam ew  matt you did  liam thats your brain man i sat next to his body waiting for people to come back they never  did i piled some of keyleths flowers on his chest and then i fell asleep in the field six /none/  feet away from him party  marisha did you think we were going to  liam yeah well  marisha never mind  liam i dont know  laura oh shit  liam i dont know what i thought but thats what i did  laura why didnt you check up on the earring dude  liam i wanted some space  matt so as you all come around to the breakfast morning food is being cooked up within the  kitchen by some of the various villagers that have taken up to help out with what they can /none/ in the area  you start realizing that vax is nowhere to be found and as this conversation begins to  progress he eventually finds you guys and waltzes into the groaning room of semiconscious westruun  denizens  laura yawns where were you  liam getting a good nights sleep on a field of grass how are you doing  marisha we had a bender  liam you need some water  marisha yeah  liam can you make some  laura in that endless jug or does it only make beer and mayonnaise  marisha say water to /none/ the endless jug  travis yeah it makes water  sam it seems like a waste  travis give me water like the ocean  sam oh no no no  taliesin no  matt the jug is now filled with water to the top  travis yeah look water  laura is it saltwater  marisha i dip my finger in and take a taste  matt it is saltwater  laura groans damn it grog  travis did i do it wrong  sam you did it wrong  taliesin you should try that though see if you /none/ like it  travis is there anybody else sleeping in the room  matt there are a few folks that are probably still sleeping off the drinking but id say the majority of the  folks have woken up in various states of grogginess  travis whispers hey should we wake up the rest of the people with this  sam the people whove lost their city youre going to prank them  travis well im feeling a bit salty this morning  laughter  travis i go outside and i dump it  marisha i cast a create water /town/ spell so we can all have some water  matt okay  laura we should probably call everyone  in the town to talk  marisha yeah we should have a big meeting let them decide what they want to do with the rest  of their fucking lives  taliesin what did you have to drink last night  laura is there a bartender or somebody thats running the inn that everyones staying at or is it kind  of makeshift  matt its just kind of makeshift however whoever who once ran this place is no longer  /none/ here probably left with the first or second wave of evacuees everyone here is just kind of doing  their part to keep it going  laura can i grab someone nearby that looks like theyre up and about and actually accomplishing things  matt yeah theres an older woman who did not drink but just was around last evening whos done most of  the cleaning and even though theres no reason to clean shes still just kind of going through the  motions of wiping down the counters and putting things away properly  laura dear heart um /town/  matt yes  laura could you spread the word that theres going to be a town meeting  matt a town meeting what for  laura so we can talk about how to keep everyone safe dear  matt all right  laura yes as soon as possible can everyone meet here  sam no the central  laura in the center of town  sam where we killed kevdak  laura where the goliaths where the barbarians sorry grog where all the mean people were  matt all right ill get the word out and she puts away /none/ a couple of towels and grabs a couple of  people near her and the three of them saunter out into the main walkway  sam also i dont know if he remembers but sometime in our revelry last night i asked kerr  if he could i gave him a sheath just a sheath of a sword and i asked him if he could make just  a little theres some metal components to it i was asking him if he could just make a  little secret compartment on it like a place that you could hide a /tavern/ little vial or a little powder or  a little note or something just in the side of the sheath  patrick what are the odds that i would make a total hash of that  laughter  patrick im imagining i dont do that much delicate work  matt no but also how much did you drink last night  patrick oh right yeah i can totally do that  matt so how much how drunk were you  patrick you know i probably was pretty modest i probably drank with her to be social and then  i /none/ probably just kind of prowled and made sure nothing got out of hand and everyone was okay  yeah i probably ill take a shot at it how attached to this sheath are you  taliesin snickers  sam yes extremely  patrick extremely  laughter  patrick ill see what i can do  liam just nail a sock on the side of it itll be great  laughter  sam i dont make the best decisions  matt especially while drinking you find your way back to your forge which is still functional it  was not one /town/ of the buildings that fell on the initial attack you heat it up late into the  evening it doesnt require a lot because its smaller work go ahead and make a blacksmithing  check with your proficiency bonus plus with this it would be dexterity because its very  very minute work  sam could i have inspired him  matt you could yes you can very much do that  sam i will give him a limerick to inspire him with  matt drunken scanlan limerick here we go  sam have you heard the legend of shale /none/ one eye elderly frail to a black dragon she told you  may be ancient but im old and somehow lived to tell the tale  cheering  matt go and take your d10 inspiration dice if you want to add that to the roll  patrick all right so just proficiency bonus  matt plus your dex bonus  patrick yeah my vast dex bonus 16  matt 16 thats not bad its not the finest craftsmanship in the world and what once was a  very very beautifully detailed sheath to a weapon now has a somewhat hammered /none/ dented  element to it that you probably want to hide with a silk or something its an imperfection in what  was a previously a perfect element but it is functional it is a small compartment that  actually has a tiny metal slot that can be moved closed or open with your thumb  sam great  matt its functional its not pretty but it is functional  patrick we focus on function here  sam i understand thank you for your nimble fingers next time ill ask percy to do it  laughter  taliesin and it /none/ will explode  marisha i make a tonic out of the glissfoil that i had in my pouch from the garden back in  emon pass it out a little hangover tonic  matt it does help actually  laura all of us  marisha yeah  laura sweet  marisha just a little crushed herbs and water like a tea  travis a little hair of the dog huh  laura thanks kiki  travis are we day drinking  sam also before we go to the meeting i havent used it in a while but i would like /none/ to use my  scrying potion to not potion the scry that i left at our greyskull keep so long ago to kind  of see whats going on at greyskull  taliesin your scry pie  sam yeah  matt glancing at it this moment now and its about midday you concentrate on what you left  behind  sam yep we all know what it was  matt you have a brief view a small windowed view of the kitchen before you it seems to be  currently empty  sam but still standing  matt but still /town/ standing you do notice in the sink there are some fresh dishes  sam oh okay  taliesin squatters  marisha its fucking squatters  sam or maybe our staff  taliesin unpaid now so now theyre squatters  sam okay  matt laughs its an important distinction  travis can you talk through your poop  sam no no poo doesnt work that way travis its a oneway street  travis the finer points are lost on me  ashley you left it in the kitchen  sam i left it in a jar in the kitchen and i /none/ told the people not to open it  marisha we only got a c on our general inspection rating  laughter  matt theres a parchment thats just nailed to the outside of the keep at least its good  calligraphy all right so unless you have anything else to prepare in this time most of the  townsfolk are beginning to converge towards the square in the centralsouthern region of westruun  where you had the showdown battle with kevdak outside of the margraves home the now deceased  margrave everyone seems to have gathered together and there is /none/ an air of tension as you approach  as folks are muttering to themselves then it gets quiet as you all step into the central area  there is still its been pulled over it was partially damaged before but there is a  large elevated platform that was used for speeches or celebration elements that has been  for the time being fixed to allow you guys to stand up if you wish to address the rest of the folks  laura who wants to talk scanlan youre so charismatic  taliesin what are we going to say  /none/ sam im still reading my book but yes were just going to ask them a question  laura i think we need to ask them where they want to go  taliesin and if they ask what we think  sam we dont think anything well support their decision right  taliesin i think something  sam what do you think  marisha i guess i could talk to them  taliesin i would like to build the death of a city is such a blasphemy it is the murder of the dead and  im horrified  marisha percy /none/ a city is nothing without living people in it a city is made up of the people that  live inside of it  taliesin it is  marisha we have to protect them first  liam percivals suggesting letting them live here building something for them underground  marisha which we can facilitate  liam rather than running  sam we have a lot of other things to do lets talk to them  travis how about pike talks to them  ashley me  travis yeah you were born here  laura this is true pike they know /none/ you  ashley sighs well im not very charismatic  sam ill be with you  travis but youre genuine  ashley do you want to help me  liam exactly you are genuine  ashley so were telling them asking them if they want to stay and if they do stay that we  could built them shelter  laura help them take shelter in the sewers if theres danger  travis the dragons dead we dont know if another one will come  laura can we ask before we go up on the stage if kerr if youre /none/ willing to help should they want  that is that something you could help us with  patrick i would be delighted to help facilitate things between you and the community i know a  lot of people that have left will return i dont doubt that for a second but right now everyone  is scattered and scared and a lot of families have been separated a lot of people who would  love to return here and rebuild the city they dont know where their loved ones are and i know  that is preying on their minds /town/ more than their own safety in some cases i know most people are  looking to leave and come back eventually and depending on the resources like what youve  generously offered from the caves that will keep them from being refugees they can continue  to be a community in this other town and then return wellorganized and with resources to build  it sighs i dont feel theyre ready to do it here and now though i dont feel theyre excited  about that i know that so many of them have people from their lives theyre just /dung/ missing  travis and by the way its going to be a hot second before the carts come back from the cave right  patrick yeah probably  matt another day or two before they arrive yeah  marisha can we even say that these people are in  ashley so are you thinking they wont want to stay then  patrick i know from speaking to a lot of people over the last couple of days and even speaking to  them last night theyre relieved that the dragon is gone but theyre worried about more in the  /none/ future but primarily theyre looking to be safe now and reunite with their friends and family  and most of those people are in  matt kymal  patrick kymal  liam i think we give them a choice but i think pike i think its a good idea i think you  present the idea of staying and getting word to the people in kymal that some of their loved ones  are still here still living the dragon is dead summon them back to rebuild  laura how far away is kymal  sam two days travel  /none/ travis wow fucking shorthalt  ashley how do you know  laura was that in your book  sam my girl is there  laura your daughters in kymal  sam yes ill be going there anyway  travis haylie maylie  sam kaylie  marisha and kymal hasnt been hit yet  taliesin not yet  liam is kymal bigger or smaller than westruun  matt its smaller than westruun  laura well  liam theyre better off in westruun  marisha im afraid with each refugee we add to another city were only making it a larger  /none/ target  taliesin which is why sighs there is no safe harbor right now  marisha and theres no point in rebuilding  taliesin there is  marisha why  taliesin because this is civilization this is  marisha theres no point in rebuilding right now when theres still three other dragons who will  only come and go stomp stomp stomp dead  travis they might  taliesin they might  marisha they will  taliesin no they might we dont know they will  patrick if you were a dragon what would you do  taliesin i would /none/ hit the city where all the refugees are going because it would hurt more i would not  hit the city thats going to take 200 years to be a shadow of its former self  marisha yes but youre also not a vain dragon who just had one of its allies taken out in this  very city these dragons are going to have a huge vendetta against westruun now  taliesin i may not have lost an ally but i am a vain dragon  travis maybe they will maybe they wont how about for those who want /none/ to stay we help build  some fortifications for those who want to leave well protect them on their way there  liam were at wartime the people can live underground for now  taliesin building will give them something to do and if the dragon comes back they will be safe  underground and if the dragon doesnt we have saved thousands of years of inspiration  and life its you cant just abandon something like this theres too much here  liam otherwise what else are we fighting for  taliesin otherwise it becomes our friend pike from /none/ nowhere  travis that would be bad  ashley that would be bad  laura that would be terrible  travis scanlan get their attention  sam get their attention all right  laura and pike do you want to step up there  ashley okay ill go ill go  sam i blow my horn to call the meeting to attention  matt horn noise everyone gets really quiet the two of you step up onto the platform  ashley airhorn noises  matt laughs it gets quiet everyone gets quiet you hear one voice in the back go /town/ thats my  pike as you immediately look over you see at the far end is wilhand leaping up trying to get  a view between the crowd everyones quiet looking at the two of you now on top of this  platform which puts you just over head height from the rest of the folks by the way  ashley stuttering hello everybody from the town  sam im doing signlanguage interpretation  laughter  ashley i know im not one usually to speak up but because i know so many of you and some of you are  /town/ family blows kiss um we im sure you guys have heard because of the party and festivities  from last night the dragon has been killed  matt theres a cheer crowd cheers clapping  ashley and we know that some of you have stayed because if anything else this is your home  matt some murmuring  ashley and some of your family has left for kymal  sam kymal  ashley kymal but we wanted to give you all an option and for those of you that do want to stay  we would like to provide you /town/ with an underground protection of sorts  matt whispering and murmuring whispers through the crowds  sam as we speak upwards of 40000 gold are being delivered by your finest men this with our help can  help construct a sturdy underground layer that will shelter you if the dragon were to come back it  will take days possibly weeks to construct this but if you wanted to stay this would be your best  bet however we are not forcing you to do anything if you would like to go with the fellow  refugees to kymal or /none/ find your fellow citizens scattered about roving in the lowlands that  would be fine too we need to come to an agreement today so that we can help you do what you want  matt one gentleman takes the stage next to you guys man in his younger 20s kind of soot  smeared on his cheeks looks like hes a little weathered by the experience even though he looks  young and thin there is a general hardness to his face from recent experiences he kind of raises  up looking at the both of you below him /town/  i for one miss my family and have no home to go back to and the the homes that are empty in this  town right now are empty because those who lived there are now dead there are ghosts here i  wish not to see every morning when i wake up if im going to live here i want to return with  those that are important to me and build a new home over the old now is not my time to stay  especially if more of those things are coming back if anyone wishes /town/ to come with me to kymal please  stand with me  and he steps off the stage and make his way to the right side of the stage everyone in the crowd  looks to each other and few folks begin filtering off and gathering around him id say about a  third to half of the crowd begins to shift over as another person steps up right next to you  guys actually this is a woman in her late 40s or so shes wearing relatively nice clothing  thats been kind of torn apart through constant use /town/ and not really having an option to change into  she looks like she came from money but has definitely been pulled down to the same level as  the rest of the folks here theyre living in destitution out of necessity her hairs  trying to be pulled up into a bun but a lot of it is kind of falling around her face and shes keeping  this kind of poor facade of her previous life and she stands up  i myself my familys history is here in this town and i would be remiss if i /none/ didnt express my  hesitation in leaving that behind for the next roving horde of barbarians to rush in and take  from us while were away especially if this gold is to be retrieved how do we know how much of that  is to be distributed how much was my familys versus yours if were to divide ourselves at this  point were leaving ourselves open to inner conflict lest we have a very clear idea where  these funds are going and i for one want to make sure i have a home when my family returns /none/ so  im not leaving im not going to come back here months down the line and find four layabouts  living in that home made a complete mess of our things and telling us its now theirs those who  wish to stay stand with me harrumphs and she walks offstage to the side  taliesin im going to get up on stage  sam whispers you dont live here  taliesin the terrible woman may have a point  laughter  matt thank you what  taliesin sighs many of you are going to leave and thats fair /none/ and thats right youre free to  do so i wish any of us could promise you safety once you leave this city but there is no safety  anywhere the dragons fly freely they may come back and wreak their vengeance upon the rest of  westruun once again they may not they may find new fresh targets we dont know long sigh we  will build an underground haven in case of attack free of charge we will make a place that is open  to all since there seems to be some dispute about the finances we /none/ will create a trust that will be  used to help those who stay and help rebuild it will be managed and it will be fair and it will not  go to titles if youre properly titled youll have money elsewhere and youll figure it out  laughter  matt you hear hmph  taliesin new money  laughter  sam old magic  taliesin old magic new money from ivory towers i would urge you to stay i would urge you to  leave collect your people and return i would urge for one city not to be /town/ wiped from the map  and anything we can do to make this at least livable while it is rebuilt we will do our best  to help sighs it is such a victory for them if westruun falls and i sit back down  matt make a persuasion check with advantage  taliesin 22  matt there is a silence in the crowd and people have stopped shuffling from side to side some of  the folks on the side of the gentleman began to shift back and people tend to stand up and even the  gentleman who /none/ was standing at the opposite side kind of ponders for a moment well regardless of what  happens we have to get word out we have to let our loved ones know what has happened and that  its safe to come back if you indeed can help us set this about im confident we can keep out  of sight at least hopefully  marisha i stand up on the podium um sorry while the terrible man and the terrible woman both  absolutely have a point  sam whispers hes not that bad  taliesin whispers im that /none/ bad  marisha i look at the man whos off to side i agree with you that finding your loved ones is  most important i believe we can actually maybe do a little bit of both here and solve both problems  me alongside with the help of other magic users can help quickly build an underground  bunker and i would be willing to help escort any party to kymal in order to help find your people  whereas i do agree to an extent with percy that we should not let westruun fall to this this city /none/ is  only as great as its people  laura woo good leadership  laughter  sam thats definitely vex  matt some claps and a few folks kind of agree and nod their heads the gentleman that youve been  talking to kind of looks at you and hes very intently engaged and nodding in agreement  marisha uh to westrunn huzzah  laura huzzah  taliesin the awkward woman makes a fine point  matt and the people eventually raise their arms to westruun to westruun  laughter  matt the clapping comes together  travis yeah football /none/ rules  taliesin pike do you remember that spell you cast on greyskull keep when it got hit by  the dragon the thing you did  laura that was divine intervention i thought  taliesin was that divine  matt no she summoned a planar ally that one was  ashley to help rebuild  taliesin that was expensive wasnt it  ashley no  matt that spell was expensive  ashley yes  laura it was like a thousand gold  matt that was planar ally  ashley what do you want to rebuild i mean underground  /none/ matt depends on how long you want it to stay so a task measured in hours requires a thousand gold  per hour  taliesin no no no  matt a task measured in days requires 10000 gold per day  laura in alarm no no no  matt mind you these entities can do some crazy stuff  sam yeah and we have 40000 more gold coming thats four days of entities  laura but i dont want to use up all the we can do that after things are  sam what else are we going to spend /none/ the money on  ashley i can try divine intervention again so  marisha we dont want to rebuild a city thats going to be stomped by dragons in another three  months  ashley no just the bunker right  laura just the bunker  ashley not the city  laura no  ashley keyleth can make the bunker  laura its fine  sam for hundreds and hundreds of people  taliesin yes  marisha honestly if we take a couple days i can make a pretty extensive  taliesin were going to use a previously existing sewer /none/ system and were just going to reinforce it  with pillars and then block off any of the sewage and reroute it since it doesnt have to handle  the load that it used to  ashley were going to build a vault  taliesin were going to build a vault  patrick while theyre chatting ill step forward and ill say we all have a lot to think about  talk with your friends and neighbors and come to know your own minds this is a decision that has  to be made soon but not on the spur /town/ of the moment thank you for coming  matt one man in the front an old friend of yours his name is joseph puts his hand up  kerrek of which mind are you are you staying or are you going are you going to escort go along  as an escort with this woman or are you staying to protect us where you walk i walk  patrick i am going to do what would be best for the town as a whole i am not sure to a certain  extent ill be led what is needed by /town/ the town if  matt what we need is a decision  sam if i may if i may im so sorry i know everyones talking here a city is not just a  collection of houses and streets it is a person of itself and we cant go dividing it right now  everyone should stay here everyone should be a unit a cohesive unit and we me keyleth and  one of your own pike will definitely travel to kymal to spread the word if you give us a list of  your ancestors family members friends we /town/ can get word to all of them very quickly  matt make a persuasion check  sam 28  matt everyone in the crowd seems to nod and the gentleman kind of nods his head to you all right  laughter  taliesin youre a monster  patrick since you havent been as present in the community for a while if i am sure that things  are adequately defended here i might go myself to ensure the proper apportionment of funds and to  talk to those of our townsfolk who have already left and perhaps organize them a /town/ little more  effectively so that they can return  matt theres a few nods of agreement that spread through the crowd and actually the folks on the  left side with the woman that seemed to building tension and arguing amongst themselves over the  ideas of that seem to quiet a bit at you taking up that position you guys notice this too theres  a general respect for kerrek that other folks dont seem to carry in this community everyone  nods in agreement well i have no objections neither do i the woman on the other /town/ side  huffs well have no other choice do we everyone nods and they look up to the rest of  you look to you then lets begin building  laura bunker it is  liam as all that starts to wind down i ask my sister to point me towards reginalds daughter  laura do you see her  liam the one with the nice hair  laura yeah that one and the giant bag of gold  liam i seek her out in the crowd  matt shes still looking up kind of by herself in the crowd /none/ clapping off to the side as you  approach  sam im going to hang near him  liam excuse me young miss  matt yes hi  liam im sorry we havent spoken but you spoke to my friends you spoke to my sister my sister  looks very much  matt i can see the similarity yes  liam i know the news they delivered to you i am so sorry for your loss your father was very brave  at the end impressively so and i want you to know that ive also recovered his body and /none/ i  thought to add him to the pyres that this city did outside the city but i thought maybe you had a  family plot or somewhere youd prefer him to be laid to rest ill gladly take him there for you  or take him with you whatever you prefer  matt ill come with you id like to see him one last time we have no family plot we were meager  folk but he spent most of his life working in that field i think its only fitting thats where  he spends the rest of /none/ his days show me and as you guys begin the building process she follows  you out to the field where she is shown the body of reginald and she takes a moment of quiet with  him and cradles his body but theres a smile on her face and she says thank you for letting her  say goodbye face to face with your help you both bring the body back to the farmhouse where you had  first met and you spend the rest of the day interring his body within the hillside that is  buttressed against /none/ the actual farmland that he tilled  liam to lose a parent before their time is no easy thing im very sorry for you  matt its all right he did good  liam that he did  matt lets go ahead and make sure the rest of these folk have more to look forward to shall we  she looks at you for a second and you can see she takes a general scope of your expression  and your emotional state and even for a young girl she has a stronger insight than you  expected and she /town/ puts her arm out and touches your shoulder and says you carry too much  sadness with you youve done a lot of good let yourself let yourself understand and accept the  fact that youve done a lot of good and she starts walking back towards the town  liam i linger for a bit  matt all right now you guys begin the process of building this subterranean bunker you take the  first day scanning through as a group clearing out whatever creatures lurk beneath the city  nothing of severe threat lies down there to your /none/ power level and you know what once was a threat to you  guys long ago within the period of a day youve cleared out a very very sizable portion of the  sewer system and because its been empty for quite a while its also not in a very terrible  state either i mean it still needs to be cleaned but thats also the specialty of those  who can control water and air let alone reinforcing the stonework that keeps the walls  themselves sturdy strong able to support any heavy weight on the surface  within /none/ the next couple days you guys continue the reinforcing process people begin actually moving  their supplies down underground and begin taking bits of furniture and elements that would at least  make life down there more comfortable or at least a ghost image of some of the life they  lived above because when youre down there the comforts are what keep you going but the people  seem as more and more of it comes together folks genuinely begin to get a little excited at the  idea of having a safe place to live for a while /none/ and you feel like this is doing some good for  these folks at the very least whenever you guys would like to take your journey  taliesin i would like to do a couple things just to the room before we do anything other than this  to our houses  matt certainly  taliesin i would like on one wall to carve the names of every survivor who stayed in the city  and on the other wall start  sam in draconian  taliesin in draconian  laughter  taliesin terrible person and on the other wall /none/ start carving in the story of  marisha those weve lost thats not what you were going to say  taliesin what weve done to save the city and where the story and where the city came from and  what has happened and make a place where other people they can start carving in also the history  and everything they need to say about the city just one of the giant walls i just want to start  filling in with stories of the city  matt okay and this catches your attention too because as pragmatic an /town/ individual as percy is  this is a strangely artistic endeavor of his point at least the intent behind it  taliesin you disagree with my opinions  marisha i dont really agree with immortalizing ourselves in stone  taliesin its not about us  marisha way before were even dead  laura its not us keyleth its the history of the town perk up youre driving me crazy  laughter  taliesin how long do you live  marisha if i complete my journey it could be upward of a thousand years or more  taliesin how long do /none/ you think i live  marisha less than a hundred if youre lucky  taliesin no  marisha how long  taliesin sighs i am percival fredrickstein von musel klossowski de rolo iii  marisha no kidding  taliesin my ancestry dates back thousands of years and will continue for thousands more unless  whitestone falls i live as long as whitestone lives this place is the human soul this is what  we have built with our tiny moments to lose a place like this we dont feel it immediately but  it would ruin everyone in small ways /none/  marisha not all of us are lucky enough to have a lineage in a name  taliesin not all of us are lucky enough to have a lineage in a lifespan  marisha not many of us are lucky enough to have a lineage at all  taliesin which is why we save everyone we can  marisha i guess that is one thing we can both agree on  taliesin this is good were doing here this is great good and its not about idolizing  ourselves its about a very long story which we are even you /none/ a tiny part of  matt at this moment you look down and notice that while you guys were having this talk a  small child has walked up to the wall and where percy has stopped the carving the child has  picked up a piece of wayward chalk that was on the ground and has begun to draw little stick figures  on the wall where you stopped and in a little bit of the quiet he stops and looks up over his  shoulder at the two of you and smiles and then just goes back to /none/ writing on the wall  taliesin hell outlive you right there  marisha yeah no youre probably right look at him i guess this little guy is like the moment  encapsulated hey bud  liam kid voice thats a octopus  laura kid voice thats a shark this is a flower  ashley kid voice this a bear  taliesin i give keyleth a little hug  sam pikeypants do you want to have gone to kymal or do you want to have stayed and helped  ashley didnt you volunteer me to help  sam i volunteered you /none/ to come with me to kymal  ashley ill go with you to kymal  travis ill come along to chaperone no im kidding  sam you can  patrick oh so these two things are happening simultaneously  marisha are these two things happening simultaneously  matt this is up to you guys the kymal journey  laura its a couple days  sam a couple days and back  matt well not according to druidic spells  sam oh yeah you could bamf us there  matt which is what i assumed you were referring to about instantaneous /none/ travel  taliesin at some point we should put a teleport circle in this down here  laura that would probably be smart  matt well you would have to contact an arcane practitioner  taliesin somebody else is going to do this weve got shit to do  ashley lets bamf in  sam lets go do it  marisha so were all going to go  matt if you would like to  laura im going to stay and help build  matt okay so scanlan pike and keyleth youre going with them  marisha i guess so /none/ you guys are going to need me to get back  sam thats true  marisha unless i can get you there and then you can walk back fly there walk back or you can  taliesin teleport  ashley can you fly  sam i can fly  marisha i can mist form us and then we can get there in how many hours  matt mist form youd get there in under a day  marisha teleporting is more fun  matt so what are you doing  taliesin teleport them there and then they can get back /none/ on their own  sam yeah we can get back on our own its two days  marisha all right  taliesin they just killed a dragon theyll be fine whats a bandit going to do  marisha have fun you gnomes magic crackle  matt all right she finds one of the surface trees just outside of the sewage system as she  touches her hands to its bark the bark cracks and splits open revealing the doorway behind it  about five foot of internal wood tunnel leads to an opposing side that opens into what immediately  /town/ is a tent city on the outside walls of kymal you guys quickly step through with the moments you  have before the portal slams shut  marisha high five high five  sam nope  marisha asshole  matt you do get a little tag from pike right before it shuts  marisha yeah scanlan you suck  laughter  matt you guys are now standing on the outside of a small cluster of trees outside of kymal the  mountain range behind it you can see there are hundreds and hundreds of people that are displaced  in /none/ the outside of the city in tents  patrick before because assuming its been it sounds like a couple of days if theres walls and  artistry happening have the wagons gotten back  matt they have actually yes  patrick and if there are those resources and i know that this trip is happening ive got to go  across and make sure that my people arent dying of dysentery  sam youre coming  patrick yeah  sam great coughing third wheel trying to get some action here  laughter  matt theres a high five tag to /none/ keyleth as pike jumps through and before it slams shut kerr  goes wait and jumps through after  sam no this is great its great to have an old dude with us also  ashley i do think its great  liam two old dudes  ashley theres so much that i wanted to talk to you about kerr im so glad that you came along  sam grumbles  laughter  patrick theres important work to be done here  ashley there is very important work to be done and i feel like we all need to focus /town/ on that and  get down to the nittygritty of it you know  liam i think your nittygritty might be different from somebody elses nittygritty  laughter  ashley lets go lets walk  sam lets go spread the good word about westruun and the great things happening in sewers there  matt all right you guys begin to make your way from tent to tent finding individuals many of  which you recognize some have recognition of you and theres a brief little discussion of whats  happened whats transpired and you tell them of the fall of /none/ umbrasyl of the herd being sundered  and sent westward and making sure as scanlan would that vox machina is responsible  sam yes and that it rhymes  matt indeed there is no central guidance here the margrave tumner wann who runs kymal does  occasionally come out to check up on people its not like theyre being kept out of the city  forcefully theres just no room for them theyve taken in as many refugees as they can and then  everyone else on the outside is being helped to the best of their ability but theyre /none/ very thin  on resources theyve sent trade wagons out to stillben even southward they sent some over into  the verdant expanse to hopefully trade with syngorn there have been people that have been  trying to help where they can however most of the people outside are still beginning to starve a  little bit a lot of the beasts of burden have been converted into food out of necessity so  theres a lot of empty carts and wagons around people are in this holding pattern waiting to  hear any news and the news that you /none/ bring does bring hope to the eyes of those that do speak with you  sam at some point in our journey i excuse myself for ten minutes drink my last shitscrying  potion poop out a little loaf  laughter  sam take a tiny bit in it wrap it in a little bit of parchment stick it in the secret  compartment of the hilt of the sword  matt okay  sam the scabbard yeah  taliesin you should name the sword number two  laughter  sam i like it  matt the classiest of magic /none/ practitioners scanlan shorthalt you do so like spackling a  wall you fill the compartment affixed within the scabbard without issue  sam thank you  liam shove that dingleberry in there  taliesin fresh blueberry sherbet  matt anyway  sam all right so weve spread the good word are people going to travel back do you think  matt many folks are now considering returning some folks speak of another group of people that  are over by the foramere basin theyre going to go ahead and send people over there to give word  some people are /town/ asking to see if their family members are okay and you dont know everyones  name there but you tell them there are survivors most of the people you talk to are intent on  returning because this living situation is only going to be so good for so long  sam i hope were not sentencing them to death  taliesin to be fair the town youre currently in could be gone next week  sam thats true  taliesin either way  patrick i know whats needed back there ive got access to money they have wagons and /town/ labor i  know most of the people in town so im not going to do it myself but i know who honestly anyone  who runs a farm is a better organizer than any modern small business owner  matt this is very true  patrick so i will talk to a few of these old capable farmer types and say okay heres the  money you know how to bargain do your business and we can get together and well head back all  together as soon as you can get everyone together and all that also ill /none/ put somebody in charge  of making sure that were bringing in food and ill do a scan around and make sure that people  literally arent dying of dysentery that they have a clean well and all of that stuff  matt yeah i mean there is disease as tends to happen when you have people who are displaced and  clustered like that in subpar living conditions but no major pandemics that are kicking through  the people there the people who are sick are being tended to and there are people who are  medically practiced or /none/ at least herbalists and such that can help with that you find a slight  group of trustworthy individuals that you know would do well and understand the process and with  the mere inclusion of a few thousand gold would be more than enough to be able to purchase from  the interior of kymal enough oxen horses and other beasts to bring most of the current carts  back with you that was the only real barrier because kymal was like we cant help you guys  for free now theres gold people are like oh well lets /none/ talk charity only goes so far but  you do feel through this trip that youve definitely made an impact and most of the people  at least over the next week or so will be outfitted with the proper materials food for the  journey and be able to make their way back towards westruun  sam and i will also go to look for dr dra and kaylie at some point  matt go ahead and make an investigation check  ashley ill go with him  sam 27  matt okay as you walk with him within /dung/ mere hours almost like you picked up the scent on a  hunt you see a glimmer of short dark hair and you glance over and sure enough there is kaylie  who is currently holding over her shoulder dr dranzel who is limping alongside her  sam oh god is he okay  matt you can go and ask  sam ill go and ask  matt theyre walking across the street they havent noticed you yet  sam oi shorthalt  matt theres a stop and kaylie turns her head  sam hi  matt she drops dranzels /none/ arm and rushes forward and gives you a hug and then lets go after a  second and pushes away glad to see you survived thats good  sam you too hows he  matt hes got a foot infection nothing too great to look about you look down and his left  foot is all swollen hes like ive had worse  sam pike has healed feet before  ashley may i  matt please be my guest as the halforc grins with his hat still floppy on his head he presents  his horrible foot that gives off /none/ a delightful smell of putrescence  sam while she works on him im going to take kaylie off to the side  matt its easy enough for you to cleanse elements of disease with minor healing well say for the  purposes of this through a couple of lowlevel spells youre able to pretty much take care of his  foot entirely hes like thats incredible i mean if you ever need a traveling troupe were  always looking for someone to keep us on the up and up can you cure hangovers  ashley i can  matt well /none/ hang with me young pike while this is happening you turn to kaylie  sam im so happy that you are alive and safe and i came a great distance to do other things but  mainly to see you and i just wanted to say a few things before i go off to complete my mission you  know i know im not the father that you wanted but im the father that you have and im sorry i  just wanted to tell you that ive been doing a lot of thinking about you and me and where /none/ i fit in  to the life of a family man most of my adult life ive been longing for a gnome to care for  and i met a really good one and shes here and her name is pike and shes beautiful and  wonderful and possibly my soulmate but ive learned that shes not my family and never will  be youre the gnome that im to care for forever and im doing something very stupid now with my  friends were going to try to save the world and i didnt know why but now i /none/ know and if we die  doing it it will be for a good thing and if we dont then well ill find you and ill be  whatever kind of father you need me to be one whos close and helpful  matt she shushes you puts her finger up and shushes you then steps up and looks at you the  hardness in her face softens and there is a little bit of tears gathering at the edge of her  eyes when she says dont you die you stay alive  sam i dont intend to but /none/ you know i was just inside a  matt youre not going to die youre going to go do your stupid worldsaving mission like you  told me and youre going to come back and were going to have a lot to talk about  sam all right  matt all right can you do that for me  sam i promise you i promise you  matt ill hold you to that  sam well you do the same all right stay safe i got you a present its a ring its a beautiful  ring because youre a /none/ beautiful girl and id like you to keep it  matt she takes it and looks at it and goes are you sure this wasnt for someone else  sam no never  matt she puts it on  sam and youre also strong and youll need this sword and i give her my singing dawn blade which  has a unique little imperfection at the bottom of it and i say this sword has killed a king which  makes it almost worthy enough for you i hope that it keeps you safe until i can see you again /none/  matt i dont know what to say ill start with thank you well i feel pretty well protected  sam okay get out of here if you can try to make your way to vasselheim theres three more  dragons and itll be a while before i kill them all  matt i dont know youve done quite a bit of work in even these past few weeks vasselheim  ill talk it over with the doctor see what hes interested in you promised  sam gnomes honor  matt she reaches up and grabs your shirt and gives /none/ you a kiss on the forehead and then pushes  you away and says get out of my fucking face turns around and walks back towards dr dranzel  sam all right pike im done  ashley okay  matt but shes not done youre sticking with us right  ashley i dont think i can  matt oh i know im just i try  ashley but you guys are headed to where are you headed to where are you going to go  matt i dont know i figure we can based on what were hearing around here /town/ folks are heading  back to westruun they probably need some cheering up on the road from there who knows actually  ive never been to marquet before but im thinking at this point kaylie comes up and  goes lets have a talk im feeling a bit of religion coming on perhaps we should look further  west northwest vasselheim not a lot of music in those parts theyll be willing to pay for that i  assume hes like vasselheim its cold there isnt it lets get some furs they both start  walking away from you guys /none/  ashley before they go i just reach out my hand and introduce myself to kaylie ive heard many  lovely things about you  matt she looks at you guardedly and takes your hand as ive heard of you he made a promise  ashley ill make sure that he keeps it  matt thank you they keep walking so with the money dispersed the group having a returning  sense of hope with materials goods food being redistributed amongst the refugees it appears  there is a direction for the future of westruun that youve set into place /none/ as you guys gather the  rest of your things keyleth you take an evenings rest with the troupe and the next  morning return back to westruun  liam something i wanted to do last night in all the hubbub thats going on in westruun i spend  some time to find my sister and i wanted to stealth up on her  matt easy enough to do while theyre out and about taking their rest with the group in kymal  while you guys are still helping rebuilding so yes go ahead and make a stealth check  /none/ laura im just reading these names on this wall  liam 20  matt whats your passive perception  laura 21  sam oh shit  matt you hear a few very very faint very familiar steps come across the stones behind you  laura i pretend like i dont hear them  liam stubby and i pull her into a big fat hug your hair looks like shit sit down i start  braiding it  laura i love you too  liam elaina would be proud of you im proud of you  laura thats worth more  /none/ liam saved my life again  laura did i  liam i crawled out through an arrow hole  laura laughs i saw this little lump squirming i thought it was probably you tiny little you  liam theres a bit of chicken here  laura oh ow  liam one day at a time right  laura one day at a time ow  liam there  matt all right as you guys spend the next few days together forming what is a fairly functional  stronghold for at least the necessary needs of protecting a fair amount of /none/ refugees beneath the  northern area of westruun you feel confident that with the folks that are here and the folks that  are coming theres enough of a community building now where it may not be absolutely necessary for  your perpetual oversight and presence should you have business elsewhere  anything else you wish to take care of before you continue your journey  taliesin i have a small package and letter that i want to deliver to kerr before we leave but other  than that  sam a kerr package  taliesin yes i was hoping /none/ i was really hoping someone would say that  laura i would like to pull kerr aside and say you know these people here theyre a bit lost  and they need a leader  patrick yeah they absolutely do well see if we can find them one  laura im looking at one that would be wonderful just something to think about  patrick ive thought about it but no but youre very kind you know over how long has this been  going on  matt youre going on the better part of two weeks since the initial /none/ dragon attack a little over two  weeks maybe by now  patrick one thing that ill make a point of doing is while a lot of this is going on and im seeing  what theyre really capable of in terms of reshaping everything ill spend a little bit of  time at her shoulder well talk maybe a little bit or not depending on what shes in the mood  for and the general gist of it is you know that it takes a long time doing the stuff like this  youre making something and sometimes it /none/ doesnt seem to balance out that scale very well but  thats all you can do and sometimes all you can do is be around for people while they make things  because you cant do everything  marisha well kerr im certainly glad that you showed up in my life in this time when i am  building this whatever the hell this is thank you  taliesin weve made you something if you will accept it we pull out a small wooden box that we  put together  marisha i put some ashari decorative stuff around it /none/  matt so the box itself is wooden but there is fresh living ivy curled across it with a few  bursts of beautiful red flowers on each side  marisha totally whats the flower of westruun  matt the flower of westruun would actually be the white iris which grows around the western side of it  marisha beautiful its covered in white irises  taliesin you sick fuck youre amazing  laura oh the white iris no big deal its the white iris  taliesin talk westruun to me  patrick ill  sam spring snakes  taliesin /none/ too soon inside is a scrolled parchment a wooden bracelet and a metal  circlet  water bottle falls off the table loudly  sam spring snakes  taliesin trying to have a moment thank you  patrick have i got the first clue  matt no  taliesin the parchment will explain everything and how to use them but this circlet and this  bracelet will help make you a champion that can help protect this city now and should the need  arise this circlet will give you control of the body of a creature that will help /none/  marisha his names fassbender and hes got an awesome mustache and the bracelets kind of just  a bracelet but i made it it might be a friendship bracelet  patrick ill put that on  marisha it might say friendship in ashari  taliesin the circlet will if anything if the need ever arises it will be something that will  help protect the city the scroll will explain the particulars  marisha if you go up by the funeral pyres where we set the trap youll find him  taliesin ive already moved him  marisha percy /town/ will tell you where he is  taliesin its in the scroll  marisha just read the directions  matt as you read the scroll glance over it and you may have seen this entity walking in their  vicinity once or twice during the time you met them it is a 12 foot tall stone golem it is  explained in this that with the use of this circlet you have control over this creature  patrick the people of this town are you know that theyre grateful the problem is for some of  you they may not /none/ be able to say that in a way that you can hear right now but know that they  are and know that they will be for a long time and if i have anything to say about it it will be  a very very long time so thank you thank you for them and thank you for me  marisha i give kerr a big hug  patrick free hug  taliesin i watch awkwardly  matt you do as you guys break your hug you look down  marisha im going to miss you kerr  patrick /none/ well  marisha no its okay you dont have to say it back  patrick you know where i am it could be that i will see you before too long some of us have more  time than others of course  marisha im sure i will see you at some point later  matt as you step away and turn back to the wall which is mostly done carving with the names and  the story bits you and percy have been working on during this time that child has returned and is  still drawing with the /none/ chalk and as you look down at the stick figures you can see one with  antlers two that are smaller than the others one that is larger than the rest burlier thicker  around the chest one that you can barely see and one that flies across them all on a broom and  then at the very end just finishing one with funny glasses the kid stands up and looks at it  once and goes its done and then runs off  taliesin oh dear  laura i just take a little piece of chalk and i /none/ add trinket right on the other side  matt much better drawn than the rest of them  laura almost perfect almost perfect  taliesin i can be right every now and then  marisha i hate you  matt laughs so whats your next step  sam we have more vestiges to get an airship to steal  taliesin yes  marisha no  taliesin please  ashley vasselheim  liam i have to go to vasselheim  laura vasselheim is so far away and the feywild is so very close  marisha i have to go to the /none/ water tribe of the ashari  travis the feywild is close  liam i have to go to vasselheim now and i will go on my own if i have to  sam why  taliesin oh thats why  matt you have many avenues at your disposal you have to come up with some central choice here  theres also whitestone which you guys havent been to in a while yet to check in with anybody  theres definitely where all the vestiges are currently held there is all those locations so  what is your next step in /none/ the journey  marisha why do you need to go back to vasselheim right now  liam im not done with her  ashley i think i know why he needs to go back to vasselheim  travis why  ashley its not my place to say  liam i have to go now whether its just me pike i would be grateful if you would go with me  laura well im going with you too  liam i dont think that this is somewhere that you can go with me  laura vasselheim ive been there  liam /none/ yes you can go to vasselheim but what i have to do there i dont want you to have any  part of it just this just this one thing  laura well then ill go to vasselheim and ill wait outside  liam i need you  ashley i take him and i pull him aside i know that youve been avoiding me and i just have to  say i dont know who this i dont know who or what this raven queen is and i think thats what  scares me the most but i know if /none/ youre choosing a life of faith or whatever you want this to be  im happy for you  liam i take her by the hand and i pull her further away much further away did the others  tell you what happened in the tomb in the sunken tomb  ashley im getting bits and pieces  liam
