none	 have destroyed many of the main cities here have gone about searching for  items called the vestiges of divergence magical artifacts from a war of ancient times that  apparently hold some great power that could aid in defeating these dragons one of which apparently  is being held by kevdak the leader of the herd of roaming tribal barbaric individuals that grog once  belonged to and had beaten the crap out of and left grog for dead long ago while the dragons had  destroyed part of westruun and left it behind this tribe utilized that time 
town	 to take over the  town enslaving or keeping most of the people under their thumb and making an accord with the  one black dragon umbrasyl that is currently in a tenuous relationship right now with these herd  members herd of the storm as theyre known you having sent a few of them to their death via a  trap on the outside found your way into the city saved some of the individuals that lived there as  well as kaylie and dr dranzel and grog went ahead and issued a challenge to the herd to meet 
town	  with kevdak himself after some fairly decent intimidation checks it was agreed and while most  of the party stealthed behind you made your way to the very center of the town square where  kevdak leapt off the top of the exmargraves homestead and the two of you began to do battle in  a pit of spikes that was gathered in the center of the town square surrounded by a number of the  clan watching on during this fight it went back and forth a bit before grog felt that this was a  losing battle 
none	 should it continue in this way and decided to at least it seemed to me call out to  his friends for aid with the classic shakespearean battle cry of vox machina fuck shit up  liam thats from coriolanus  matt oh sorry coriolanus thank you and that is where were picking up so  sam before we go i have to inspire everyone with this  laughter  matt holy shit what the what  taliesin what are you what the fuck are you oh my god  liam i want a d10  sam and look ashleys 
none	 like somewhere i cant even see  matt please tell me that was a gift from somebody  sam no i made this myself because i wanted you all to know how passionate i was about tonight  liam sam could you kiss your right gun  ashley kiss it kiss it  sam mm tastes like strawberries and sweat  matt inspiration granted and immediately taken away  travis do your pants also have photoshopped lightning coming out of the crotch  sam no my pants are just jeans  ashley wait how far down does it go  
none	 sam all the way baby  matt thats the first step of the process the pants come soon  laura did you just do that at home with a  sam yeah i just penciled it in  matt i cant even thats a thing all righty so with that we are going into the realm of  battle lets go ahead and kick on the proper music for this so with vox machina currently on  the rooftops here and hiding within the bottom of this building we have the four archers that have  appeared on the rooftop 
none	 of the margraves house we have most of the individuals that are  surrounding this along with the few innocents which just for the sake of appearance here i  will go ahead and attempt to mark with a few markers so you know who youre looking for  innocentswise  liam were the innocents matt were the innocents  matt no youre not not anymore all right so the red markers are going to act as markers for  the innocent just so youre aware  travis percy percy taliesin youre on that roof right  matt percys over 
none	 there all righty so that all being the case guys as grog shouted at this  moment the individuals in the center of the square start looking around confused not knowing where  to come from at this moment a few of them manage to catch up a glance at the individuals that are  on the rooftops i need everyone to roll initiative along with you grog because combat  has begun again at this point at the top  marisha wait all of us  matt all of you guys this has started  taliesin i mean thats 
none	 not amazing thats better 14  marisha youre still ahead of me you rolled a nat 20  ashley whys he laughing  travis because hes fucking evil  matt because hes fucking evil is that what you said  travis who said that i will beat him with my fists  matt all right so for the sake of this one we have 25 to 20  laura 27  liam 24  sam 21  matt 21 okay so we have lets see  liam all the people who wanted to go first are going first  matt 
none	 all right 20 to 15  travis 18  matt all righty 15 to ten  taliesin 14  marisha 13  ashley 12  matt pike getting into the doubledigits  ashley oh you know moving on up  taliesin id rather have my low roll here than for anything else  laura oh god oh god oh god oh god  travis its like a roller coaster were just going ticktickticktickshooom  matt a lot here im keeping track of guys all right so the surprise round affects all the  archers it affects everyone except for these 
none	 four individuals or these two individuals with the  clubs and these two women here with big swords and kevdak so top of the round vex  laura does the second story of the house that im in have windows can i see  matt the second story does  laura can i run up the stairs then so i can get a better look at the playing field  matt actually this one was supposed to go this way for the entrance point there all right so  you are currently now looking out the side of the window 
none	  laura okay im going to im already hiding right  matt right no ones seen you at this point  laura okay then im going to hunters mark kevdak and im going to hold my turn  matt putting a green on him for the hunters mark  laura im going to hold my turn until it seems like hes better incapacitated or until something  happens im going to hold my turn  matt hold your action until  laura i think until scanlan goes  matt okay so that finishes your turn vax youre up  liam 
town	 am i at a window as well downstairs  matt you are by a door  liam am i half on a street in a door  matt youre inside the house right now the door is technically partially ajar because you guys did slip in  liam all right im going to click my boots crack the door a few inches and im going to hold  my turn until one of our magicusers pulls a trick or kevdak takes a swing at grog  matt okay thatll end your current actions the archers are surprised they do not 
none	 go it is  kevdaks turn kevdak sees you shouting out he rolled a natural 20 on his initiative  laura no he didnt thats why you shook your fucking head  matt yeah i was like man all right lets start this right  marisha fucking wheaton  matt they had wheaton come in and touch all my stuff all right so hes going to go ahead and  seeing you shout like this he looks about for a second hes going to continue his rage he  glances about looks over and he sees nothing immediately on the 
none	 rooftops but looks down at  this individual now shouting out for help before him prostrate and he gives you a glance and  says well this seems real familiar doesnt it strongjaw at which point hes going to go ahead  and take two of his reckless attacks against you thats going to be a 28 to hit  travis ill have to look but i think it hits  matt yeah second attack is a 30 to hit  travis these arent great weapon master right  matt no these are not great weapon master  laura what 
none	 is his attack fucking bonus  taliesin at least ten  matt you take 30 points of slashing damage reduced to 15 and two points of necrotic damage  because its not reduced and second ones going to be 22 points of slashing damage reduced to 11  and then five points of necrotic on top of that  sam however for the second slash im going to use cutting words to reduce the damage  travis before he does that you said 17 on the first one 11 on the second attack and how much  necrotic on the 
none	 second one  laura seven overall plus two necrotic on the first hit five necrotic on the second  matt you might have to get a little bit closer to make sure that he can hear you  laura plus that would be giving away your hiding  matt whatre you going to do sam  sam i step forward closer to him and i use cutting words  matt okay you step to the very edge of the rooftop here  laura oh god  matt well say for the sake of this right there  sam and i 
none	 shout oi kevdak i have a message from the people of westruun and i moon him  laughter  sam and i say kiss our metaphorical hairy arses  matt just like that on your shirt as he brings around his axe for a second swing he hears that  and glances over his shoulder and sees this shiny gnome butt up on the top continuing the swing  though to attack go ahead and reduce the damage using your cutting words  sam ten right  matt uhhuh  sam pff one  matt so you take ten points 
none	 of slashing damage from that strike oh youre wielding mythcarver  so his next saving throw is at disadvantage right  sam yes it is  matt because youre not currently wielding your weapon kevdaks going to go ahead and take a step  back and glance over at you as hes going to move his fingers up and point towards the roof and you  see a bunch of the other entities and archers whoosh shift their attention over in your  direction sam all right that finishes kevdaks turn scanlan youre up next actually you do  get 
none	 an attack of opportunity on him with your fist because youre not holding your warhammer  right now  travis i rolled a five plus what my strength  matt i mean its your strength modifier plus your proficiency modifier  travis 13  matt 13 no you punch his back and it just hits off his muscle all right sam youre up  sam okay from my crouched buttout position whilst holding my hand cone of clarity  matt where are you holding it  sam its shoved up there  liam between the legs upsidedown  sam before 
none	 i make this attack when i scanned around did i see any of his allies without any  weapons or carrying a staff or something like that  matt no theyre all the type of people that would be at all times wielding something at their  side there are two individuals that you do notice there is this one here and there is  greenbeard right there and they both appear to have some sort of a quarterstafftype implement  but everything else is either bladed or giant clubs or some sort of big melee weapon  sam but 
none	 theyre surprised anyway  matt they are yes  sam okay okay well then i will cast hold person at level three on kevdak  matt on kevdak  sam yes  matt oh boy  sam at level three so i get to target one other individual  matt you would yeah  sam and i would target the beardy guy with the staff  matt all right hold person for a minute wisdom saving throw for the duration okay  sam wisdom saving throw with disadvantage  matt with disadvantage yes that is true kevdak all right  
none	 sam because of cutting words  matt he rolled a 19 and an eight taking the eight that brings it to a ten so thats a  failure on him  cheering  laura for hold person does it unparalyze him if we hit him  sam no hes just paralyzed you can have at him and can i still move and do other things  matt you can in a moment we have to figure out if the other guy makes his save he rolls a  natural one  laura yay  matt aw man the rest of 
none	 these people are going to be real pissed  liam this is where my held turn comes in  laura me too but i was in front of you  liam yeah go for it  travis if you hit him does he become not paralyzed  liam no hes stuck  matt yes at the end of each of his turns the target can make another wisdom saving throw and  paralyzed for those who are aware what paralyzation does a paralyzed creature is  incapacitated and cannot speak automatically fails strength and dexterity saving throws  attacks rolls 
none	 have advantage and any attack that hits the target is a critical hit if its within  five feet of the creature  laura oh five feet damn it oh but thats good for grog okay  sam okay wait i still get my move right  matt you do  sam okay is there any cover are there chimneys is there anything i can duck behind  matt you can duck behind the other side of this roof if youd like  sam and still maintain sight oh wait no id be more than 60 feet away  matt 
none	 i mean its more the casting time you can still move away once youve cast the spell and  hold it there  sam okay then ill duck back behind some cover and as my bonus i still get a bonus i will  inspire grog and ill say grog now its your turn to fuck shit up  laughter  sam all right  matt and that finishes your turn scanlan  sam yeah thats it  matt grog youre up  travis hes paralyzed  matt you watch as he steps away from you points up and all 
none	 the archers turn towards that  everyone else looks over at the rooftop and you hear a cacophony of voices around growling before  kevdak takes another step and grunts and you see the gleaming ass of scanlan in the distance  the high noonday sun bouncing off of his pale sundappled gnomish skin these two round globes  of victory staring down from the rooftop  sam round globes of victory i love it  travis can i walk around to the front of kevdak  matt do you want to pick up your weapon first or  travis 
none	 no  matt nope okay  liam do the twins go first or does grog go first  matt oh right because you held your actions so up to you  sam okay do your thing do your thing  liam im going to go  laura im going to go  matt yep all right so we have now vex taking your shots  laura yes yes im going to shoot from my longbow of the sky sentinel so thats three  attacks on the first attack  matt yes and they all have advantage because hes paralyzed this 
none	 is bad for kevdak but well  see how it works  laura okay so  matt still raging so everythings halfdamage  laura so 19 plus 12 probably hits on the first attack  matt yeah that does  laura okay 19 plus 12 hits on the second  matt yep  laura and 17 plus 12 hits on the third  matt yeah they all hit  laura okay im adjusting my glasses im so nervous okay 28 on the first hit  matt 28 reduced to 14 okay  laura 21 on the second hit  ashley 
none	 get him baby  laura 16 on the third hit  matt okay that reduces to eight all the arrows strike true thumpthumpthump but still each one  is only piercing the flesh so far hes generally so dense in his musculature each impact is not  having the same satisfying impact sound youre used to but that ends your held action and it is  now your turn  laura oh but i get another attack because thats just one attack  matt oh right that was the sky sentinel go for it take a second attack  laura 
none	 my second attack im going to take at greenbeard and im going to shoot through the  flaming bowstring  matt okay  laura 17 plus 12 probably hits 17 plus 12  matt yeah thats going to hit  laura okay gah 14 on that one  matt 14 okay 14 damage to him greenbeard is currently stuck there in place the arrow sinks  into his robe and you dont even see the impact it absorbs into the cloth and he goes ah and you  hear the escaping air from the impact but he cant actually move 
none	  taliesin hunters mark  laura i hunters marked hes hunters marked already  taliesin okay  matt at this point youd better  taliesin were not panicking no not at all  laura not at all hunters mark i did it i swear  matt all right youre up  liam just to verify because kevdak is still raging am i denied the surprise attack from  inside here  matt correct  liam okay so im going to use sharpshooter and drop five to hit harder im going to throw a  dagger at advantage yeah  matt 
none	 so youre moving up into the doorway  liam yeah to the doorway right so the first  matt who are you attacking  liam kevdak 60 feet  matt 60 feet youd okay yeah you can get right into there and probably still hit him from  there because you have sharpshooter you dont have the second increment range go for it  liam okay so its 25  matt that hits  liam four oh hold on ill save that four 20 okay  travis my hands are fucking shaking  liam counting 31 37  matt 37 
none	 and half of that is going to put it at 18  liam okay id like to use my bonus action to throw the next  matt you had the held a held action is just your action  laura oh yeah you did the clicking the boots of haste already  liam i thought that was a gimme oh thats the bonus action  matt well the idea being that when you hold your action you have an action that you hold until it  triggers the bonus actions a whole different thing that you have to take on 
none	 your turn  liam so taking a hold is an action i dont understand  sam holding your turn loses your bonus action  matt yes essentially you have your action and your bonus action holding your action means you  hold that one bit of it but your turn still continues past it  liam okay which doorway where am i on the map i cant see myself right there could i run to  the corner of the building that the archers are on and scrabble up the side of it  matt over here  liam and 
none	 get to that archer  matt you can certain try it  laughter  matt you rush past one of the peasants fear in their face theyre confused and looking around  and you see theres mud and a little trickle of blood thats dried down their face as you  darting noise by they go gasps you dont pay too much mind to them  liam acrobatics check  matt make an acrobatics check  liam 30  matt 30 you manage to make it up to the top  liam do i have an action left  matt 
none	 no you used your action  liam action action bonus action with the hasted boots  matt technically you wouldnt be able to move at this point even but im letting you do that  usually your move its a little weird  liam okay so im outta gas  matt so yeah  travis this is the most epic map ever by the way  matt trinkets just chilling in the house sad bear noise all righty so that ends your held  action now grog youre up  travis can i walk around to the front of kevdak 
none	 please  matt okay  travis knowing that he pointed up with a hand at scanlans beautiful ass hand still on his  greataxe paralyzed can i try and rip continuing my rage because he hit me last round  can i pull the axe from his hand  matt go ahead and make an athletics check  liam hes going to fail this one  matt with advantage because you are raging  travis 27  matt oof you yank the bloodaxe from his grip  sam yes  travis because im frenzied raging do i have another move 
none	  matt i mean  travis like can i hit him with it  matt lets check on that because i dont know if its an attackactionbased because you didnt  take an attack action last turn you used your action to pull it away  looking at that right now the berserker is here let me see  sam lots of rules tonight guys upperlevel rules  matt yeah its a bonus action so you could if you wanted to the weapon isnt attuned to you so  it would just act as a regular axe possibly  ashley 
none	 make it attuned to you  marisha thats a short rest  travis can i looking at the axe say oh i do hope you have a necromancer in your group because  im looking at a fucking dead man  laughter  travis can i aim right above the gauntlet below the elbow on his left arm swing to his side with  the axe  matt like on his left arm sure youre going to be its going to okay so youre raging  advantage well no reckless attack would be the advantage if you wanted to  
none	 travis well he did it against me so i get it against him  matt well you have advantage against attacks with him anyway because hes paralyzed i will  say itll have okay youll have advantage on the attack but i will say its a general minus  five to the attack just because its a very specific called shot go for it  marisha do it do it  travis oh thats much better 20  matt all right go ahead and roll damage  travis i dont know what the attack bonus is with the axe  
none	 matt its a d12 and add your strength modifier  travis okay where is it jesus  laura thats it thats it that top one that one yeah  matt poor d12  travis this one plus what  matt strength modifier which would be three  travis ah so five  matt five whoosh you hack the blade and it sinks quite a bit into the arm right above the  elbow you can see as you pull it out a bit of bone is exposed from it but the arm is still  intact it wasnt enough damage 
none	 to go through but hes like stifled yell  travis and it hit him right so is it an automatic critical because it hit  matt because you were within five feet so yes so double the dice so whatd you roll on the dice  travis so it was a two  matt so four so instead it would be seven damage still not enough but you do do a  significant amount of damage to his left arm his nowopen hands gripping nothing actually the one  hand was holding the axe and the other one was pointing 
none	 up so hes like strained sound  looking at you right now as the blood begins to seep out of the fresh wound on his left arm  travis do i have any of my movement left can i move around behind him 50  matt you can move three more spaces so yeah  travis ill either flank him or yeah  matt three thats where you can get right there okay that ends your turn surprise back  percy youre up  taliesin thisll be fun well see what happens all right first thing im going to do 
dung	 is cast hex  on kevdak on the asshole im going to hex him  matt laughs cast hex on the asshole  taliesin so he is now enveloped in my dark smoke of death hes also now at disadvantage on all  strength checks  matt okay  taliesin thats a thing  matt thats the thing with hex all right so yeah you watch as grog walks around him grogs  shadow seems to stretch out from his form reach up and wrap itself around almost merging with  the tattoos across his torso the actual bear tattoo 
none	 almost seems to be almost  covered with shadow  travis i love you  taliesin i know im so happy im going to take a little step back to get a slight bit of cover  from those archers for when they start hearing the big bangbangs coming from the house to get  halfcover so i can still  matt which way are you going  taliesin im going from my current vantage point to about seven oclock eight oclock  matt about here  taliesin yeah about there for a little bit of cover from the arrows 
none	 and i can still see kevdak  matt yes you can  taliesin so if i wanted to take my little pistol and start carving a little and ive got a nice  little chunk of bone i can see in his arm can i take a sharpshooter disadvantage to hit that point  matt you could ill move this board a little bit so you guys can see better  taliesin so im going to shoot with sharpshooter specifically for his arm  matt his left arm you do not have a view on it right away  taliesin 
none	 oh  matt i would say from your perspective on the rooftop because he was turned this way and is  facing this way you would have a big ol view of his back and shoulders  taliesin okay im going to take a shot for the elbow  matt on this arm  taliesin im going to try yeah on the visible elbow  matt okay  taliesin im going to sharpshooter through that shit see what happens  matt go for it  taliesin okay and im happy if you want to put any weird disadvantage  matt 
none	 you have advantage on the attack because hes paralyzed  taliesin no i dont because im at distance or do i have advantage be  marisha hes paralyzed  taliesin oh hes paralyzed i have advantage on the attack  matt you have advantage on that and then you have disadvantage because its a called shot plus  minus five  taliesin okay thats fine but i get the bonus ten points still  matt you would if you hit  taliesin okay all right thats fine natural 20  all oh  travis oh my god are you serious 
none	  marisha yeah yeah  taliesin shouldve used the big gun really all right thats okay so thats oh hello baby  youre over here actually im going to use the pink one  matt whats the first range increment for the pistol  taliesin 400 feet  matt yeah okay  taliesin im scary  matt gun go for it  taliesin i know sorry i know i thought about that come on baby no whammies  do i double the dice  matt double the dice and then add the modifier to it  taliesin okay so thats 
none	 16 counting 32 points of damage for the first shot  matt 32 points of damage okay half of that into 16  gunshot you watch as the blast hits into the side of his arm the arm actually hyperextends and  part of the bone shoots out the side and he goes and screams out the arm does not you know it  looks like its in a rough place  taliesin im shooting again same thing  laura oh my god hes going to shoot his arm off  taliesin 17 good enough 17 im rolling good

none	  matt all right so three of these individuals some of which you may have passed in your time  and two of which you see are members that were absorbed into the tribe from what was previously  the rivermaw tribe roar give off these angry roars and go into an immediate rage breaking the  surprise element and charge three of them on you one of them goes darting across the field  right towards you pike with that these pull out this sheet here these herd of the storm  warmongers are going to go apeshit on 
none	 your ass grog thats six attacks on you because of the  flanking rules thats going to put four of them at advantage  sam oh my god  matt first one is going to be an 18 to hit  travis misses  matt misses the first one goes and swings towards you and you duck underneath it and  whoomph misses you by a mile however as thats happening another blade comes the other  direction thats going to be a 25  travis that hits  matt natural 20 third one so one hit second ones going 
none	 to be a 28 so thats two hits and a  critical and then one that doesnt have advantage on you with both strikes is going to be 23 that  hits and a 16 that misses so  sam you do have inspiration  matt four hits and one crit  travis i cant use it on this stuff though only when i attack  matt all righty so the four hits first thats going to be 15 points of slashing damage  travis reduced to seven  matt reduced to seven right ooh 19 points of slashing damage 
none	 reduced to eight  travis okay  matt 13 points of slashing damage reduced to six and another 13 reduced to six now for the crit  taliesin i would like to remind you that potions are a bonus action thank you  matt counting thats going to be 22 points of slashing damage on that reduced to 11  taliesin whew you are a tank  laura unless hes unconscious  matt pike so youre now surrounded on all sides kevdaks there before you but youve now been  completely swarmed in by three of these entities pike this 
none	 one rushes towards you battlecry  this female halfelf you can see a line of drool from her face with the sheer speed she was running  and the froth that was forming at the corner of it she leaps into the air blade in front and is  going to come down on your tiny form counting thats 28 to hit on the first one  ashley yeah  matt and a 28 rolled 18s on both advantage ones  ashley okay okay okay okay  matt right so two hits on you you take 19 points of slashing 
none	 damage from the first strike  ashley thats not halved no its only halved because hes  matt only because hes raging  ashley im a barbarian too  laughter  matt 19 on the first strike the second one is 13 so thats a total of 32 points of slashing  damage to you and thats going to end the barbarians turn everyone else finishes out  surprise round now were back into full initiative everyones in play top of the round  vex youre up  laura okay if i aim an arrow its at disadvantage  matt 
none	 if you aimed specifically for something it would be at disadvantage and a minus five to hit  laura okay im going to cast im going to cast  matt i mean hes paralyzed so it would have advantage so it would cancel out it would be  just a regular attack at minus five  laura okay heres my question  matt yes  laura the siege arrow that percy gave me is that a magical weapon or a technical weapon  matt its a technical weapon its used essentially against structures objects  laura so just structures  
none	 matt its an explosive in an arrow that is used primarily to destroy structures yeah  laura so it wouldnt harm people  matt i mean it would hurt people like a regular arrow and it might do a little bit extra but  laura not anything crazy  matt not that you know of you dont have a full understanding of what the arrows capable of you  did not create it  taliesin i gave you the big debrief with the arrow i gave you the howto  laura i know i know i know i know

none	 okay  taliesin thank you  laura nice percy  matt you can see from the distance the visage of this halforc looks back as you do that and goes  and goes to shakily hand reaching back for another arrow this archers going to go ahead and  leap down onto here oh you do get an attack of opportunity on him  laura he knocks down a tree in the process  marisha what a dick thats a natural 18 so thats a 26  matt pretty sure that hits also rolled a natural 19 on the acrobatics 
none	 check so lands fine but you  do manage to do one attack worth of damage to him as he jumps down  liam airsoft shot to the nuts  marisha i rolled double ones  laura pathetic  marisha plus five so seven  laura thats not bad thats not bad  marisha little damage  liam something to remember you by  ashley maybe he only has like ten hit points  matt cool so your elemental form swings wide manages to slam the bottom of them as they leap  down sending them into a spin but 
none	 they do manage to catch themself because theyre quite acrobatic  in doing so they step up to the very edge here to their friend who is currently on the ground who  is also going to get up there and theyre both going to look at each other pull their arrows  out and theyre going to go ahead and make a series of strikes lets see this one here is  going to go ahead and is going to shoot at pike because pikes on the ground and this ones going  to go ahead and strike at 
none	 grog because it cant see percy over there through the tree so grog  laura natural one natural one  matt that is a 19  travis misses  matt misses you arrow sound one arrow hits the bit of your shoulder armor right here and shatters  off the bone the second one however is a 26  travis yes that hits  matt all right so from that one you take i dont like that cocked nine points of piercing  damage reduced to four the one thats taking two strikes at you pike because youre on the 
none	  ground now  ashley its also probably very hard for him to shoot through the people that are attacking me  matt there is one individual attacking you that is on the other side of your body so youre  pretty visible from that point in time  ashley okay  laura shes really little  matt however the attack because you are prone it has disadvantage on the attack rolls with you  because its not within five feet of you but its going to go ahead and attempt to make it two 17s  in a row 
none	 plus ten thats sorry not plus ten plus eight on the archers yeah plus eight so  thats 25  ashley yeah  matt and natural one on the other disadvantage so that misses you take 13 points of piercing  damage from one of the arrows arrow sound so its going to do there they finish their turns  this one is going to being pushed shoved off come around here  marisha what whos that  laura oh thats the one you pushed off the roof  matt is going to come over this way and hide to 
none	 the side just going to watch whats happening  that finishes the archers turn kevdak grunts unable to do anything is going to attempt to make  a saving throw and that is going to be a total of 18 whats your dc  sam 20  yelling  travis oh scanlan i will make out with that fucking shirt i swear to god  sam i mean my spell dcs 18 but with the hand cone of clarity okay  taliesin dont talk him out of it  sam just making sure  matt oh man all right well

none	 if my aim is true  matt yeah if you get it there you can manage to hit all of them but grog right there  sam okay  ashley go scanlan  matt one two three four five six  sam okay three charges is 10d6  matt all right so go ahead and roll that kevdak automatically fails because hes paralyzed  liam yeah mvp  matt so does greenbeard  sam 34  matt all right so 34 reduced to half because hes raging that brings it to six no 17 all  right and then greenbeard 
none	 takes 34 the other ones there they do not get advantages because  theyre all just fighters thats a failure failure what was the spell dc on the wand  because its different from yours  sam dcs 15 i wrote it down dc 15  matt okay so thats a success success so two of them over there take all right  taliesin itll be fine itll be fine things are working  matt all righty great so explosion giant burst of flame hits it actually sets fire to this  entire structure the wooden barricade is in flames 
none	 well say for the purposes of considering that  sam theres flaming spikes on the field  marisha flaming spikes  matt all right so there we go there is currently  taliesin i was really hoping you were going to come up with a oh wow thats actually never  mind i am not disappointed at all  matt so those are on fire  marisha hah i thought you were going to come out with a f that that yeah that works that  matt all right so  sam im going to try to do the pike

none	 you can shout over the side you have to get into view of her which  means you have to move a little bit closer to the edge but yeah  sam okay ill do that  matt okay so you get about there glance off the side all right go for it  sam ill peek over the side and say singing never going to fuck you up never going to let you  down never going to run around and not heal you  laughter  matt all right so go ahead and roll your heal for pike 
none	 grog youre up next  sam yeah seven points  ashley oh ill take it  matt hey it all helps all right and with that grog youre up  laura oh my god singing natural crit  travis so in my frenzied reckless attacking great weapon master can i bring my axe up high  and swing it for the first attack to his left side where dangly hand is  matt you can go for it your regular straight attack you have advantage and then its  disadvantage for that so that brings it to a regular attack 
none	 minus five  travis disadvantage for the  matt because of the called shot  travis okay  marisha but then advantage because its reckless  travis 23  matt 23 hits with the minus five  travis no 18  matt still hits  cheering  taliesin you asshole  matt so its a d12  travis counting 20 for the first one 30 with great weapon master  laura but you double your dice because its a natural crit because hes five feet away  matt because hes paralyzed and five feet away  travis 60  laura 
none	 no just your dice double your dice  matt this is with your axe right so with the axe its a d12 plus your raging bonus  plus your strength  travis 11 which is seven or eight rage bonus is eight  matt well the rage bonus should be plus the total becomes plus  travis oh sorry the total bonus is eight  matt three plus four isnt it right now so it should be seven  travis thats why thats a seven thats it right  matt yeah youre not using your warhammer youre not attuned to 
none	 this weapon  travis right okay so whatever  matt so whatd you roll on the dice  travis 11  matt 11 technically its a critical hit so i mean its a critical hit so you do your brutal  critical you roll two more d12s so it was an 11 times two thats 22 plus seven thats 29  plus 2d12  travis five so thats 34  matt 34  travis and a nine so thats 43  matt 43 reduced to half thats 21 points of slashing damage  travis and thats the first one called 
none	 shot  matt with that thunk the blade finds its way into his side as you hear cracking on the rock  below him the sound of the left gauntlet cracking hitting the bottom of the square the  fingers twitch in the gauntlet as hes currently standing there with his left arm bisected from the  rest of his body  laura does he shrink  matt no  laura dammit  travis second attack straight across his back  matt okay straight into his back  sam does another smaller doll hand come out to replace it  
none	 laura teeny tiny  travis that is a 22  matt 22 hits  travis yeah 22 okay and thats four so double this 12 right so four times two is eight plus  four is 11 math is a bitch and two more of them because its a critical okay seven and a nine  matt 28 half that is 14  laura math math is fun  matt so youre hacking into him you see the wounds are opened and his body is shaking from the  amount of pain thats wracking him at this time hes still 
none	 holding up against a lot of damage  thats come to him but hes starting to look a little rough  travis so i have my third frenzied attack for a bonus action right with my bonus action i have  one superior healing potion can i take that  matt you can yeah that will heal you a superior lets see superior is 8d4 plus eight  travis 8d4 plus eight  matt your superior thats the expensive one you guys got  liam 8d4 foursided the foursided pyramids  travis fuck me asshole fuck fuck me asshole seven 
none	 nine ele 12 14 16 19 20 20  matt all right so you heal 20 all right that ends your turn grog all righty unless you want  to move  travis can i can i huh  laura you could pick it up  travis i cant pick it up i can only move  matt i mean you have you wouldnt be able to wield your axe  laura but can you put it in the bag of holding  matt next turn if you want to try it  travis no im going to can i 
none	 move if i stay in his flank if i move away from the three guys that  are surrounding me theyre  matt theyre all going to get an attack on you  travis ill stay  matt all right all right so that finishes your turn grog  travis yes thank you  matt next up is greenbeard who is currently frozen in place however rolls an 18 plus five  as far as his wisdom is plus ten so that puts him at 28 so he resists the hold person and is  currently no longer affected by 
none	 that all right that finishes his turn though because thats the  end of his turn percy youre up  taliesin all right this is going to be fun that asshole who just shot me im now aiming at him  and im going to push him off the roof thisll be fun so pushing him off the roof am i going to  do extra damage to him or am i  liam if he hits if he hits the ground  taliesin well i mean im debating whether or not to sharpshooter it to do no i think 
none	 ill  just push him off the roof its funnier  travis i can feel my heartbeat in my face  laura i know i cant tell if its actually really warm in here or if were all just really hot  matt probably a little bit of column a a little bit of column b what was it  taliesin 28 to hit  matt 28 hits nonsharpshooter  taliesin nonsharpshooter  sam dullshooter  taliesin but im doing a torso shot so he gets no save theres no save for the torso shot hes  going to take 
none	 his damage and move ten feet away from me  matt okay  taliesin so thats 14 points of damage of piercing damage  matt 14 points of piercing damage and he gets shoved off the back of the roof hes going to  make an acrobatics check which he succeeds so he lands down there and he only takes one point of  damage from the fall but there you go  taliesin fine im going to reload and now what am i going to do lets see  sam jump down the chimney deliver presents  taliesin surveying 
none	 the field trying to make some decisions  sam help pike  taliesin i cant well  marisha can you hit greenbeard  taliesin i can hit greenbeard im going to hit greenbeard hes got the magicky creepy thing right  laura yeah hes gross hes got mold on his neck  matt fungal moss on his whole neck and chest area  taliesin all right well well see how things go lets do a sharpshooter shot at him right now  lets see what a little bit of damage does to him so sharpshooter with retort dont miss and

none	  laura because he can roll acrobatics just like we can  matt because theyre yeah you guys can do it they can do it too and theyre pretty strong so  he basically runs up puts the sword on his back jumps up onto the roof pulls the weapon he  doesnt manage to get an attack on you because it took all of his movement to get up there but he  gets up there  marisha no one wants to fuck with the elemental really no one  matt right now youre not a huge threat to 
none	 them at the moment and theyre both going to focus  actually on you scanlan when it gets around to their turn though this guys going to go ahead  and pull both of these innocent folk in front of them as a shield this guys going to get freaked  out rush around the building and try to escape there okay so bringing us into the combat  portion of the round grog you have two more attacking you this is the bladestorms  travis bladestorms  matt with advantage thats going to be a 14  travis thatll 
none	 miss i havent said that much tonight  matt 18  travis that misses  matt so first one both attacks swinging across you youre feeling it on your back but its  catching most of your armor and part of your flesh that is nice and calloused and does not really do  any damage the second one rolls a 20 second one and second attack on the second one is a 21  travis that hits yeah  matt yeah okay so you get a critical and hit on this one so this is the bladestorm critical is 
none	  going to be 16 eight points of slashing damage on that one and the next ones going to be four  points of slashing damage this is already halved just so you know so thats that round there  against pike only one of them could get to you and still attack this round so pike thats 19  ashley misses  matt and thats going to be a 15  ashley misses  matt so one strikes against you hits the back of the armor and streaks off so you spin around as  the second blade comes 
none	 around and you deflect it with the shield angrily  marisha yes  ashley this is so fucking stressful  matt that brings us back to the top of the initiative order vex youre up  sam what they just approached me they didnt attack me  matt oh there was the one guy that got up there with movement thank you for the reminder so  before that happens actually reminder this one did have enough movement to get up there and still  get attacks off on you  laura okay hes attacking percy  sam no hes

dung	 person they can go in  matt yeah so grog are you willing  travis well yes  matt and with that as you reach down and touch grog with it you see grogs form shimmer for a  second into dark shadow and then vanish inside  laura and i want to fly on past and go up to the next roof  matt okay so grog is currently off the table as hes locked inside the gauntlet  laura where should i go where should i go  matt where are you going as you rush away you

none	 you streak off as all these blades hammer into your side cutting the bottom of your feet  one of them hits you in the back of the neck and curves across your lower back and as you pull  away clutching it you look at your hand with the blood pooling in the middle of your palm and you  look at the gem with a faint glimmer of a form of a human inside the gem thats currently mingling  with all the blood thats smeared across your body as all of a sudden you coast around through 
none	  the air the wind whirling past you and you spin around towards the top of the margraves estate  and you can hear the blood in your body heartbeat sounds in your ears as you start  getting a little dizzy and realizing just how rough you are at the moment from that exchange  laura okay  marisha wow  matt technically youd probably be higher than this up there if you wanted to fly around okay  so that ends your turn  laura that yeah  matt vax youre up  liam im going to use 
none	 my bonus action to dash and hasted i get 24 squares of movement  on this board  matt yes  liam im going to drop off the roof staying along the wall i should be able to take a  diagonal at that corner and totally avoid greenbeard  matt oh you mean dodge off  liam i want to go no i want to go straight this way towards the tree and drop  matt towards the tree drop off here  liam all right yep i want to go along the wall i can swoop around it 
none	 and avoid greenbeard im  going to run past this barbarian shell probably take an attack but im wearing that cloak so shes  at disadvantage im going to run up to kevdak and im going to stab him twice i should get sneak  attack damage and a crit because hes frozen  matt you do  liam then im going to run the fuck out thats what id like to do  matt okay  laughter  matt you rush up you manage to avoid greenbeard there is one of these guys there who was holding  his 
dung	 place seeing what things were going on he had no target at the moment was staying nearby  with disadvantage that is 21  liam misses 22  matt 22  liam daggers out hasted raven queen armor fuck yall  matt as you dart past this blur of dark motion swings towards you and where it is about to catch  some of the armor theres a burst of black feathers that lift behind where the blade struck  through as you dart up right into the face of kevdak whos like strained sound trying  desperately to resist 
none	 the effect of this go for it advantage on the attacks  liam okay advantage on all these right right right  laura oh my god ermagerd  liam ermagerd 22 for the first which hits ah yeah they both hit and 26 for the second first  one three plus oh my god three plus eight ten 16 22 23 29 32 which is doubled to 64  plus six  matt well 32 plus six because he takes halfdamage  liam right well lets get it up to the top and then halve it so 32 to 64 
none	 plus six is 72 halved  matt right 72 halved puts you at 36  liam thats the first and then the second one does two plus six is eight no two and  dabababa  laura four right  liam thats just the dice is doubled so four its ten  matt all right  liam and id like to use the rest of well go ahead  matt so yeah so as you rush up you slam your dagger square into the side of his body and as  you push it inside you can see his eyes 
dung	 glancing back down towards you held in place his arm  broken still dangling from the little elements of ligaments that keep it shifting there with the  impact of the slam it swings from the sheer force of the blow as you push the blade to the hilt and  even further in you feel your hands actually push into the wound itself about an inch your fingers  getting dark and wet with the crimson gore of the interior of his body as you push up inside you  pull back pulling the blade around in your pommel 
none	 and jam it over the top of the shoulder  into the side of his body the muscle flexes from the tension of the hold person spell managing to  reduce a portion of the damage but it left a pretty serious wound  liam any movement i have left i want to use to run up to the other side of the wall that keyleth  is on if i have enough ill climb up if not ill go behind that barrel but if i before i go  quietly i say to kevdak your fate is sealed here 
none	 today my friend  matt okay he does not get an attack of opportunity on you because he is paralyzed and  the guy already took one against you so he already used his reaction you rush past him you do not  have enough movement to get to the top but you do get to the corner right where the barrel is okay  liam yeah  matt that ends your turn its now the archers turn  laura oh god  sam oh god so much bloodshed  travis can we do some recreational drugs or something take 
none	 the edge off  laura were going to were all going to die  sam all we got to do is get kevdak and theyre fucking lost  taliesin ive got a scrooge mcducksized pit of xanax at my house im just going to dive into  laura once we kill him his gauntlets are going to be there we have to go in and  get his gauntlets  sam yeah thats a point thats a point made you know who could get them whos fast and  strong trinket  matt this guy here is going to go 
none	 ahead hes out of range of you marisha shoving this barrel off  the side to try and get away from you  taliesin attack of opportunity  matt marisha you do get an attack of opportunity it does fall and hit the barrel next  to you i mean next to vax it doesnt hit you but it spooks you momentarily as it slams onto the  barrel next to your side and rolls off  marisha rolling terribly  matt whatd you get keyleth  marisha ten total  matt ten total misses  marisha oh no oh 
none	 i had to roll to hit im sorry i was rolling damage  matt whatd you roll  marisha i didnt roll to hit to hit that is plus 16 to hit  matt 16 versus the archer 17 just misses  sam you really blew it  taliesin to be fair shes a bit winded  sam oh shes winded thats nice thats nice  matt theyre both having now made out the connection between the mooning and kevdak holding  himself in place theyre both trying to take you out one of them has disadvantage because youre  
none	 in its spot and it couldnt get away from you it had nowhere to go really so ones taking two  attacks at you scanlan that is going to be heh a 12  sam miss  matt and a 26  sam hit  matt the other ones going to have two attacks with disadvantage against you thats even with  disadvantage thats a 21  sam hit  matt and the other one with disadvantage is a 15  sam hit  laura what 15 hits you  sam i am not wearing some things  matt yeah

none	 so go ahead and make the attempt  taliesin thats 14 points  matt 14 points yeah  taliesin dexterity modifier 11 so i can reduce it to three points of damage i still got hit so  matt so go ahead and mark that okay and this guy over here at the very top moves over as well  and is going to go ahead and take two more shots at scanlan since theres currently not a whole  lot he can see in the area thats a threat to him near this gleaming beacon of pink and purple 
none	 up on  the rooftop another friend of his is currently whaling on so two attacks against you thats  going to be a 19  sam hit  matt and 23  sam hit  matt all right you take another six points of piercing damage go ahead and make your  sam yeah 20  matt what was it 20 okay second one is 14 points of piercing damage  taliesin oh jesus  sam six  matt and with that the hold person fades concentration lost from the barrage of arrows from  the nearby herd archers 
none	 you hear a roar across the battlefield roars currently with one  busted arm no arm on the other side kevdak is screaming in terrible pain and anger  liam but hes great at riverdance  laughter  matt all right archers finish their turn it comes to kevdaks turn hes going to go ahead and  use his bonus action to go ahead and use second wind heals 17 hit points on that rolled a ten  he is then going to lets see huh  marisha no ones around him  matt yeah he has no axe he

none	  laura what why  matt in order for her to move further you might move out of combat with the other guys that are there  liam but theyre all attacking each other  matt the command move means on their next turn they attack each other doesnt mean that theyre  charmed or dominated  ashley but how many feet did i move how many feet am i able to move anyway  matt that wouldve been ten feet you can move 15 more  ashley okay i can move 15 more anyway  matt yeah but you 
none	 will take two attacks of opportunity if you move out of range of these two  ashley but wouldnt that be included in the attacks that i just took if i can move 15 total  matt you can move 25 total because of your tiny feet you moved ten you have 15 more feet you can move  marisha your tiny feet  ashley should i stay ill just stay  matt okay  sam you need to heal yourself dude  ashley i know i know i know  matt barbarians are going now this one picks up

none	 like  marisha just focus on the mission  ashley focus on the mission at hand  matt ends up that guy there then also takes 22 points of damage on them okay they start hacking  into each other with their blades suddenly trying to figure out whats happening and technically  another barbarian strikes so the third one who actually missed you that wouldve been an attack  against its own guy because that was the one that didnt hit so he wouldve been once again  against this guy so he deals an additional 13 points of 
none	 damage against one of the other ones  okay got you so that finishes their turn there so these guys here are going to move around the  fire this guys going to move up here  liam everyones at disadvantage with me just a reminder  matt yeah this guy here is going to go ahead and move one two three and then using greenbeard  who reaches out and grabs him with his elemental arm and alleyoops him up onto the roof with the  acrobatics roll rolls a one  ashley he dies  matt this guy 
none	 gets slammed into the side and falls back to the ground missing his turn  laura falls right back down like some other loser that i know of  matt yeah laughs greenbeard miscalculates and actually slams him against the wall and then the  goliath sort of slides down takes four points of bludgeoning damage from that  laughter  matt all righty and that guy there is going to go ahead and strike at the child  laura no  matt a three and 14  marisha shifty kid cmon  sam hes a little weasel hes a

none	 right there  marisha nice  matt as the hand is clutching grog strongjaw lifting him up into the air youre conscious now  as the hands holding you on its back and you get up from one knee grog its your turn  liam pinkies up  sam pinkies up teatime  travis my herd hear me fallen is your mighty leader kevdak the very goliath swine who would  have domesticated you like a common household cat who would have made you bend a knee to a mere  dragon i show you this and i reach into 
none	 the bag of holding and i pull out one of the dragons  teeth that is still in there and i toss it into the middle of the square  matt clatters to the ground at the feet of one of the nearby bladestorms it stops at his foot he  looks at it picks it up  travis i would tell you that under the correct rule and a return of power to this herd  dragons would bend a knee to the herd of the storm where is zanror  matt they all look at each other and 
none	 greenbeard hobbles out still wounded and hurt into the  center of this area  sam does he have an actual name or is that just his name  matt greenbeards his name  sam oh great  matt steps out into the middle looking up at you strongjaw you stand above us all in a way  laughter  matt claiming dominion over a herd that you fell to and left behind for years though you struck  down kevdak what do you think makes you aligned with the interests of our people  travis oh you mistake me 
none	 seer of the herd i do not mean to lead this herd but rather to empower  you to more powerful game im here to inspire your aspirations never would i ask you to bend  the knee only would i ask you to live and fight and perhaps die in the most beautiful death you  can possibly attain join me and my fellows come to our aid when i call and with that we  will chase down dragons gods and more  matt make a persuasion check with advantage  laura come on come on come on 
none	  matt with advantage on that  travis fuck thats only an 11  ashley can i use war gods blessing or  matt i dont think it works for abilities  marisha can i assist him with a skywrite strongjaw  matt laughs bing strongjaw  marisha i mean a stormcloud above him  ashley inspo inspo inspiration from anywhere  matt its a little late for that its okay at this point greenbeard sizes you up from a  distance everyone else is waiting for a word you can see everyone is hand on the side of their 
none	  weapons looking at each other and theres this extremely tense air greenbeard turns around and  looks to two of the individuals near the front of the building and goes bring out zanror and the  two of them go inside the door and close it behind them they step inside the building and theres  this long silence you wait for 30 seconds  laura can i take a healing potion while theyre inside im up on the thing  matt you can yes  ashley can i heal grog  matt are you going to step up 
none	  ashley i can see him  matt you can see him yeah  ashley so im going to cast heal on him  matt youre going to cast heal  ashley yeah  matt as you begin to go for your holy symbol you can see two of the warriors behind you twitch for  their weapons  travis hold it is not necessary brothers look me in the eye has the taste of food lost its  appeal has the zest for life fallen from your hearts living in this domesticated dwelling i  promise you this hear 
none	 me and i promise you adventures and glory that is worthy of this herd  matt the door slams open from the front of the margraves home you see as the two individuals  come out with chains over their shoulders as they drag out into the center two individuals you see  another halfgiant goliath man one that youve all seen once before on your way to kraghammer  months and months ago well yeah about you see him swollen in the face bruised and in shackles  dragged out and thrown to the ground and the other one 
none	 holds over his shoulder another chain  he pulls out behind him a halfgiant woman with the hair on the sides of her head shaved one  single long mane of hair and it looks like shes with child also in shackles and shes pushed to  the ground with zanror zanror looks up and you can see him closing his eyes like the daylight  itself is very bright and he probably hasnt seen light in a period of time strongjaw  travis cousin  matt well this is a surprise  travis your face seems a little different 
none	  matt its at this moment that he looks over and glances and can see the body of kevdak on the  ground for the first time and then he goes you did this  travis scanlan lower me down  sam i swoop him down do you want to be on the ground or just above it  travis on the ground  sam on the ground but i release him and i make a fist that clenches right next to him just in case  anything goes bad  matt so as youre brought down to the ground 
none	 bigbys hand sets you gently on the cobblestone  travis i take a few steps forward yes this my work a debt fulfilled after many many years  matt sighs i fear the herds lost its edge priorities my father had grown docile in this  place but he wouldnt be if whispers hadnt found his ears and he looks over at greenbeard  greenbeard immediately steps back and goes look at him in shackles this isnt a warrior this is  a slave both of em spits in their direction  travis strange i would ask why is he 
none	 in shackles what did zanror do that would draw this  sort of ire from the herd  matt the one thats holding the chains on zanror pulls them a little tighter and zanrors lifted up  a little bit off of his leaningforward position hes now on his knees and his arms are pulled up  in towards his torso and greenbeard looks back towards you this skyshield here spoke against his  father he was attempting some sort of a mutiny but we quelled that right quick gave him time to  think about it his father was 
none	 deciding what to do with this traitor and his next of kin you  however seemingly stopped his trial so i think its only fitting that you do the honors of  finishing the job and you can see as you were lifted off the ground and everything you did not  have your weapon with you as you were on the ground lifted up greenbeard steps over and takes  the bloodaxe from the ground walks up to you and hands it out and looks over to zanror  travis i am sorry zanror but i will make it 
none	 a glorious death bring me the gauntlets as well  matt let it be and two of the other individuals one of the halforc individuals looks  over hushed and starts backing away from this this is too much for him theres now this tribal  tension this cultural tension that only exists within the initial herd and has been only recently  adopted by the rivermaw that were absorbed by the herd and are still confused by this two of the  goliaths step over and pull and pry out the somewhat soggy leftover arm of kevdak  laura 
none	 kind of like when youre eating lobster to get the claw out yeah  liam shrinks as it leaves  matt they toss it to the ground before you  travis i stand put on the gauntlets  matt kevdak at this point is still being held up by the chains and says  travis zanror  matt sorry zanror thank you it was unbefitting of us all to be living under one of  those beasts under my rule we were going to take back our power as a people  travis quiet yourself ive heard enough and i 
none	 lift the bloodaxe and i say you are a disgrace to  this herd and i will return this herd to power  and i pivot and i drive the bloodaxe into greenbeard  matt oh shit roll an attack  taliesin yeah you do buddy  travis reckless  matt if you want to  laura no  ashley get the fuck out  laura its a fucking natural 20  matt roll damage  sam were going to have to get these dice calibrated later  laura but why does it only happen when its a story element 
none	  travis thats an 11  matt watch as next week critical role implements dice cam  laughter  matt no thats awesome  laura oh let me take a picture ill take a picture  travis so thats 15  matt all right  travis and then two more  matt two more yeah  taliesin watch next week as we fail to open the door to his house for an hour and a half  marisha yeah yes cant roll above a five next week  travis thats 27 37  matt how do you want to do 
none	 this  sam oh you got it  matt laughs he had taken a shitton of damage in the battle and was already moving by  taliesin yeah he was pretty low  matt he had like 12 more hit points left so  travis it seems all the poison came from his head so ill remove that from his body  matt and with that moment swishing with a very slick snapping sound the blade coasts  through and the neck retreats as the head continues forward and tumbles to the feet as  greenbeards body takes an instinctual 
none	 step backward and then falls lifeless in the center  of the marketplace all the rest of the herd moves for a second nervously  travis i spin and i say do you see do you see what staying in one place does this is what  weakness looks like i would return you to the wild i would return you to power but you will  have to do it under this goliaths rule unchain zanror  sam i point bigbys hand like he was too  laughter  matt as bigbys hand points to zanror the two that 
none	 are holding the chains move up and begin to  unchain them both taking the shackles off his hands and the female goliath at his side  eventually he stands up reaches over and puts his arm around her and says i am sorry worra  travis worra  matt worra she stands and goes do not be sorry it seems weve been delivered from our  judgment she looks up towards you you dont recognize her  travis i dont  matt shes not from the original herd  travis zanror she is quite a beauty congratulations  matt 
town	 you saved us narrowly being executed grog and he stands up and gets to the front of  all the rest of the herd there call forth the rest of our people we do not leave this town yet  we claim westruun home for one more night for it is tomorrow at dawn we slam our blades against  the hide of a dragon  travis no this is honor this is pride this is a life worth living  matt will you join us in this glory and pride fair cousin grog you have proven yourself worthy  
none	 of life and respect and the might of the herd of storms  travis how many do you number  matt he looks about and takes in the mental math of all the people that were killed  marisha yeah we didnt kill that many  matt i know you took a few down wed stand between the people that were loyal to me and my  father a good 43 men strong  travis more than we need and i grab my earpiece and i go meekly thoughts  laughter  sam i mean we have a busy day 
none	 tomorrow already i dont know if we should add dragons to it  taliesin were hunting another dragon  sam just say yes we can always leave in the dead of night  travis all right all this bloodshed is giving me a terrible itch in my ear we shall stay with you  and tomorrow we will bathe in the blood of a dragon  matt he steps forward to you now theres a slight limp to his walk but theres too much  pride for him to show it as he tenses and reaches out his hands to 
town	 you and clasps it in his own  beastmasterstyle holding onto it  travis yeah strength and honor  matt for the dragons it shall be  travis it shall be  matt he releases the grasp let them walk amongst us as brethren come we have much  preparation to do and he goes back to worra and limps into her arms and she takes him up and its  her strength now lifting him on his feet and the two begin to make their way across the rest of the  center of town all the rest of 
none	 them take their weapons and they relax and they still keep a very  wary eye of you the words have been said and there is still this tenuous truce but theyre  still coming off the cusp of adrenaline warfare and the slaughtering of their previous leader  however they are going along with the words that were spoken and there is a look of general fear  and respect in their eyes guarded as it may be what do you guys want to do  liam i would like to sever the remaining gristle away from his arm 
none	 thats holding the gauntlet on  matt the gauntlets have been retrieved and given to grog yeah  liam then i would like to loot greenbeards body  travis could you do me a favor could you butcher me a skull of kevdak please  liam yeah  laura yeah yeah im going to land  matt youre going to land all right  laura and im going to call trinket out  matt trinket whos been hiding in the back room there  laura because things happened so fast for him  matt they did happen  laura and

none	  components and praying to sarenrae and speaking the rites which channel through her in celestial  language although she doesnt understand celestial she speaks it through as part of the  spell almost like  taliesin i speak celestial  marisha i also speak no i speak primordial i keep getting that confused  matt yep how are you aiding in this  marisha can place my hand on his chest and place my other hand on the ground and try and use  natural healing to assist  matt sure go ahead and make a straight wisdom roll 
none	  marisha natural one  matt okay  taliesin can i assist  matt how would you like to assist  taliesin i would like to come over and start listening to the chanting that shes doing in  celestial and harmonize and bring a voice to it since i can actually speak celestial  matt roll a performance check  sam performance  laura thats lovely  taliesin 21  matt all right as you finish the ritual both the voices of pike and percy begin to harmonize  across these various refrains in a language that especially when 
none	 spoken in this rhythmic  ritualistic way it seems to almost create a third voice and then you hear clearly there is a  third voice harmonizing with them that you dont know where its coming from  sam its me im off here in the corner sings scat  matt as the beautiful musical tones of the singing come to a close your holy symbol the  glow fades and a moment passes before you hear the soft coughing of the childs throaty  expulsion himself taking in his next breath of air he sits up cradling his head 
none	  what happened  marisha its okay i dump a cure wounds in him now  matt its okay  laughter  marisha not a potion i cast cure wounds  matt okay okay  taliesin take it take it  matt hes like choking sounds  laura i cast grasping vine and lift him up by the neck  liam shot right in the chest  taliesin six years of celestial and when are you ever going to use it it finally pays off  ashley thanks for helping percy  taliesin that was lovely thank you  matt 
none	 all right so the child is brought back to life healed confused dazed but not really  understanding the circumstances around him just happy to  marisha he heals 24 hit points  matt yeah hes good to go his wounds close the dried bloods still there but he seems to be in  perfect health at the moment although a little weak and worse for wear  laura wheres your mother child  matt i dont know  laura was she here in the square with you  matt no everything went by so fast they tried to pull 
none	 them out but they found me and pulled me  out and brought me here thats all there was a fight and a lot of yelling thats all i remember  ashley where do you live  matt up by the temples  laura okay well well help you find your family and maybe while were there we can see if  your grandfathers around  matt he smiles a little bit you can still see the dried blood streaks across his face but you  can see past that to the smile that peeks through beneath his dirty face 
none	  laura i lift him up and put him on trinket so we can start walking  matt okay he laughs and trinket licks him and takes some of that off and he is excited to be  grasping something although he slides a couple times you can see hes weak from the remnants of  the resurrection spell  marisha i give him a boost  matt okay anybody else doing anything for the short rest  travis i would like to not only remove kevdaks head just the upper part no jaw just the skull  and i 
none	 would like to use the bloodaxe to flay the skin around the bear tattoo off  laura is there anything else to loot off of kevdak  matt i mean there is the bloodaxe there is the  laura gauntlets  matt the gauntlets and he has four plusone enchanted javelins that he did not have an  opportunity to use this battle  laura sings bag of holding  liam i already called greenbeard  travis ill take the plusone javelins and id like to put the flayed skin in your refrigerated bag  matt so mark that mark 
none	 down in your refrigerated bag flayed bear tattoo of kevdak  laura flayed bear tattoo got it  matt thats disgusting general leather armor quarterstaff you do find one potion of greater  healing he did not have the opportunity to try  laura nice im putting that down  matt thats all he has on him  liam okay im going to spend the rest of the time that they did that ritual gathering up the  bodies the remains  taliesin im going to fix my gun  matt okay make a tinkering check  taliesin just barely 
none	 by one point did not break  matt good all right  liam im going to start a fire  matt theres already a fire going  liam is it  matt well its slowerburning embers now one of the barricades that had been set fire by the  fireball earlier  liam ill stoke it and then put the bodies on  matt okay so you take the bodies of the dead villagers that had been lost in the battle and the  handful of the other combatants that had fallen and you throw them onto the fire and 
none	 it crackles  and burns over time the smell of burning bodies fills the space around it for a while  taliesin we have a house to procure some items from and a conversation to have with zanror at  some point  sam what time of day is it now  travis are there any other goliaths in the square that are lingering  matt there are three lingering that are keeping an eye  travis can i walk over to one  matt sure  travis tonight we prepare for an incredible battle go release any meager prisoners 
none	 you may  have kept they will do nothing for our fight  matt very well these two stay though no offense but you did just kill one of my friends  naught but an hour ago  travis i did and your claim is fair  taliesin these two  laura whos these two  matt there were three herd members that were keeping an eye  laura oh okay  matt two of them are goliaths one of them is human the human and the other goliath stay  behind the one you talked to walks off and 
none	 seems to be following through on what you told him to do  taliesin is it lord zanror by the way i may request an audience with lord zanror at some  point with your supervision  travis yeah have at it  matt now thunderlord zanror  travis yeah thunderlord i say that in my head  sam we have pikes dad to find weve got a house to loot  marisha weve got a child to deliver home  matt did you want to look over the items you found on kevdak  travis oh fucking shit yes 
none	 may i please  taliesin and a unique opportunity to maybe really fuck up a dragon if we want to be smart  matt theres your bloodaxe and theres your titanstone knuckles  laura laughs bowing down like hes been knighted  taliesin hm we have a dragon whos going to go pick up a giant package of whatever we give him  laura oh shit youre right  taliesin we could make some interesting decisions on whats in that box  marisha that is an interesting point  laura i mean do we have to stay in the square 
town	 or are we allowed to  matt no doesnt seem to be anything holding you there other than the ritual that was done when  the rituals completed youre welcome to go about what youre doing at which point you do see as  time has passed a few people start poking through windows who apparently were either hiding in some  of these buildings and see you guys and check out and then go back into hiding again the town still  has people living throughout it many of them stay hidden whenever things move in their vicinity  
none	 laura okay  matt so  sam whats our thing do we want to achieve anything else tonight or just rest  laura i feel like we should return this little boy to his family and see if we can  find your grandpa  liam in the short term we should be able to walk freely though  matt all right so as you guys gather yourselves partially rested and breathing a sigh  of relief at the not horrible circumstance that nearly transpired there thanks to the luck of the  gods in a lot of cases  
none	 laura i cant believe were not all dead  matt you make your way northward through westruun toward the temple district small child  at your side with the intent  laura on trinket  matt on trinket by your side and possibly to prepare for whatever the herd has in store for  dawn and with that well finish tonights game  marisha now were going to have to have another huge conversation  laura we didnt die i seriously thought we were all going to die when he got healed and  everything was running  travis yup 
none	 yup i was like we might as well make it cool because were dead  liam we had it then it flipped and it was gone and then we snaked it outta the fire  marisha but we had them on the run  matt he by the way on that hold person that cutting wordshold person  like thats exactly what that  travis dude yes give it up for the fucking bard who has an article in dear vox machina  sam oh yeah appearing tomorrow  matt yeah no kevdak hadnt used his action surge yet  
none	 marisha what was that  matt kevdak hadnt used his action surge yet  sam action surge what does that do  matt multi its what he does  taliesin what i do where he can take an extra action  matt he can do four attacks in one round with the bloodaxe  sam did he ever get to attack  matt no couldnt make his save his arms were gone by the time he came around  laura oh my god getting his arms off him brilliant  matt plus he had four more superiority die and the 
none	 riposte ability so he could  travis what is riposte  matt when a creature misses him with a melee attack he can use one of his superiority die to  do a reaction attack as well so he could in theory get five attacks in one round  travis oh holy shit thats that halffighter side right  taliesin thats sexy  matt yeah that hold person really changed the dynamic really fast  liam we had a very heated discussion over the earring in that 30 seconds let me tell you  taliesin well we had that whole 
none	 long walk that was the theory  ashley i think that was the most stressful game ive ever played  laura this was incredibly stressful  sam pike almost died grog died  taliesin i was about to be toast two more hits from that guy and that wouldve been the end of me  travis that was fucking amazing  marisha that was a threehour battle we did nothing but fight  matt and honestly mucking it up with the archers helped too because they were all about to start  focusfiring on whoever was visible  laura yeah 
none	 so im glad we split them up getting grog out  matt getting grog out was key if you hadnt pulled him out and taken all those attacks of  opportunity you would be gone they werent going to stop when you hit zero  travis no no that wouldve been it  matt they were going to cut you up until you were dead  travis yeah yep  liam look at that guy  matt what  travis i know look at the face you saw it too didnt you the shadow of a man that wished he 
none	  could have butchered somebody and didnt quite get to  laughter  travis the shadow of craven edge lives behind those eyes  matt its okay bunch of dudes you guys have dragons to deal with  laura oh god  matt all right well guys thank you very much for watching thanks again for loot crate for  being awesome and being our sponsor  all thank you loot crate  matt if i dunno if hes still around is our guest still around  laura is he  sam no theres no way  travis why dont
