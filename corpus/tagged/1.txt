none	 down  laughter  liam party  matt so picking up where we left off last time the group of intrepid adventurers known as vox  machina have been making their way through their quest to take down the chroma conclave a group of  chromatic dragons who have been terrorizing the countryside in taldorei under the rule of thordak  the cinder king a great powerful and seemingly elementally charged ancient red dragon who sits in  the center of the city of emon after gathering the rest of the artifacts you guys have been  seeking called the 
none	 vestiges of divergence the last one being found in the city of brass upon the  fire elemental plane you traveled back to fort daxio a northern fort north of emon where you  were planning a trap of some kind for thordak upon arriving with two charges of yours two  previously enslaved celestialblooded boys that you found in the city of brass you all traveled  across the planes with the help of keyleth back to fort daxio to find the landscape scarred with  recent flame and apparently a battle raging at the outer gate that is 
none	 where we left off so you  guys looking northward you can see the large plumes of black smoke billowing up from the  direction of the fort the outer wall seems to have sustained some damage you can see a number  of flying entities swooping in dozens of them while you can hear the distant sound of combat  shouts and battle you guys as you land and realize this you can see the two slaves who have  now been freed and taken with you both look immediately wide eyed and freaked out and closed  off 
none	 what are you guys doing  travis this is fine  marisha so much safer here kids  laura we need to get them safe  sam who safe the place is on fire theyre not safe  laura i take off on my broom and fly up in the air  sam ah wait you forgot your hat  laura i want to see up and over the wall and see whats going on on the inside  matt okay so you fly up and head up over the front wall  laura i dont want to go in 
none	 i just want to look  matt right so you fly up and get a vantage point to see whats going on over the wall  laura yes  travis youre going to get seen  matt as you crest up in the air you notice that there are a number of soldiers currently battling  possibly a hundred or more lizard men that have swarmed into the fort as well as a number of  and go ahead and make a perception check actually to see if you can make some good detailed elements out  travis first roll 
none	 of the night  laura first roll first roll first roll here we go 27  matt 27 all right these are wyvern riders this is a group of wyvern riders with lizard men that  have swooped in you can see a number of the siege elements that have been built by percy over there  some have been firing off on the inside or at least ones that were installed in the actual fort  base you also see a distant explosion a flash of light on one of the walls on the inside there is  the 
none	 outer wall and there is a courtyard in the actual fortress itself the front gates to the  inner courtyard have already been breached and most of the battle is happening inside the main  courtyard  travis are we outside the courtyard or inside  matt as youre noticing this you watch as two wyverns are now swooping in your direction from  the outside of the outer wall  sam because they saw you  marisha so were on the outside of the wall  matt you guys are far south probably a good quartermile south of the 
none	 fort on the outside of  the wall  taliesin i say we starting making our way and deal with this  laura yeah i draw are they close enough to shoot them  matt you can wait until theyre close enough theyre a little bit out of your range right now  taliesin is it possible theyre out of bad news range or is that even humanly possible  matt you know what as of right now you could probably hit one of them with bad news  taliesin all right i double check speak now or forever hold 
none	 your peace im doing this  matt whats the long range on it  taliesin 1200  matt okay you bear down and you  taliesin 1200 feet 1200 feet  matt yeah go for it and laura you still have to wait at this point youre readying your shot  laura yeah but i hunters mark one of them  matt okay aiming for  laura oh wait its probably a ranged thing too  matt its okay youre currently selecting a wyvern or the rider to fire at  laura the rider  taliesin all right taking a 
none	 shot oh thatll do 30  matt the explosion from the front of the muzzle of bad news fires off the spark and flame and  smoke billowing forth the shot has no impact it looks like from gauging at this distance it was  just outside of the range  laura oh theyre 1200 feet away theyre that far  matt its hard to gauge really at that distance whether or not they were there but apparently the  bullet lost momentum by the time it reached their position  taliesin okay reload  marisha lets move in  
none	 laura can i shout down and yell get the boys safe but i dont know who im shouting it to  just one of you guys  travis more impassioned  laura yelling get the boys safe  sam oh my god we have to get these boys to safety  travis do we  marisha why dont we have them run have them run yeah i grab them and i say run that way  dont die theyre good  laura seriously  taliesin actually ive got a better idea  marisha what  taliesin hand them one of 
none	 the stones  marisha all right yeah sure i hand them a gatestone  taliesin well find you when its safe hide wherever you need to stay away from the castle  we will find you when its safe  marisha hide in the bushes dont go far  sam or go anywhere  matt they nod and they take the stone and they start running off towards the western edge of this  valley which has the two cliffsides that come into the valley here a lot of the nearby brush  appears to have been burned on the 
none	 way  marisha oh fuck i say try and stay unseen  matt they go darting off keeping low and you get the sense that theyre used to fleeing so  they dart off arm in arm rushing off towards the side of the valley wall  sam so theyre gone forever  matt you have time to reload before they get close enough for her to fire so if you want to  take another shot  taliesin sure ill take another shot  laura should i hang out and wait or should we  taliesin actually lets head 
none	 as a group towards this i say we run and we take everything thats  heading towards us ill wait until theyre close enough that i can get a good  marisha we all charge for the gate  matt okay so you guys are all charging towards the outer gate what are you doing vex you watch  the rest of your party darting  marisha i message to vex and i say what do you see how many wyverns are there do you see any  dragons  laura do i see any dragons  matt currently you 
none	 do not see any dragons at the  laura i dont see any dragons but it looks like about a hundred enemies  sam hundred is that true i missed that one  matt yes  travis thats a lot  sam laughing thats more than two  travis is it  liam what do you sense do you sense dragons  laura well thats going to take a minute  liam id work on that  sam all right lets just charge in blindly theres no cover out here right  matt there is no cover  sam lets 
none	 take out those fucking riders  marisha we have an avengers moment were running like guardians of the galaxy  travis thats like chariots of fire youre doing the wrong music  marisha okay you know what any movie where they run in slow motion toward something which happens  a lot  matt there you go as you guys are charging towards the blownopen gates to the outer  courtyard of fort daxio with vex swooping down on her broom with the bow out you watch as these  wyvern riders come swooping down in your direction their claws 
none	 extended their tails and  stingers out forward they come swooping down go ahead and take a shot you can take a shot as well  taliesin im taking my first shot im also making it a wing shot  laura so i hunters marked them as soon as they were close enough  matt yes hunters mark theres two and a third one has joined a little behind now theyre  coming upon you which one do you hunters mark  laura the one thats biggest  matt hard to gauge at this distance  laura the one thats 
none	 closest  matt okay there you go  taliesin wing shot first one  laura and i am a third level rogue now  taliesin 30  laura so i get advantage on my attack if they havent attacked me yet right if they havent  taken a turn  matt i believe looking at the specifics there  laura as an assassin at your third level you get advantage if you get the drop if they havent  taken a turn yet  matt technically  laura theyre moving  matt they know youre around this is less like 
none	 they havent acted yet theyve been acting every  round theyve been dashing toward you so you do not have the drop on them as theyve been making  a beeline since the beginning apologies  laura well all right i guess ill just have a 32 attack then  matt okay i want you and percy to both roll damage on those attacks as these are both guided  at the same individual  taliesin okay  laura 21 and then that is awesome  taliesin 26 points of damage and he has to make a strength save against 
none	 becoming prone  laura do i get sneak attack on this  matt no you would not unfortunately  laura okay so its just 21 damage with four of lightning  matt okay so as you hear the explosion at the front of the muzzle of bad news take off the  arrow whizzing through the air both impacting into each side of the wyvern you watch as one of  its wings tears open it tumbles forward the rider thrown off its back and clutching onto its  reins flipping over the side as it corkscrews and slams into 
none	 the ground about 150 200 feet behind  you skidding across the dirt  laura oh i didnt do hunters mark damage  matt go for it  laura an additional three  matt okay effectively slammed and left behind in the dust right now its going to have to get up  and rush to try and catch up to you guys the other two are swooping down now and have managed  to get up  laura do i get my second attack  matt you do get your second attack yes you could as well for your 
none	 round  laura 21  matt hits  taliesin same thing with a drop  sam can i extend my arm with my wand of fireballs ready to shoot  matt yeah actually  laura 18 damage  sam how far are they  matt at this point theyre maybe 150 feet from you  taliesin i dont crit on a 19 yet do i  matt no  marisha do you ever get that  matt at a higher level  laura trinket crits on a 19  matt trinkets cool like that  marisha why cant you be 
none	 trinket we love the bear more than you percy  taliesin oh i know 32 to hit  matt and the save whats the dc again  taliesin i believe its  matt you have to write down your dc man  taliesin i used to oh 19 its there i just couldnt see  matt there you go this one now as you guys both you pull back and release your second  arrow and you take bad news reload it and then fire again you watch as this time one of the  wings breaks at the hinge 
none	 it folds under itself the rider this time as opposed to holding on is  thrown and plummets the rest of the distance hitting the ground with a very heavy splat  against the stonework his head scattering the wyvern ends up slamming into the ground and  skidding off into a big cloud of dust behind you as well as you guys continue pushing forward  however that does complete your round the last one does swoop down and is going to youre  making the loudest noise and got the most attention so its going to swoop in 
none	 your  direction percival its going to come on down its going to make two attacks on you and then  harry and lift up thats with its bite thats going to be a miss it goes to snatch at you with  its bite and you duck out of the way however the stinger comes up from behind that is a 19 to hit  taliesin that just barely hits  matt just barely hits okay as the stinger slams into your shoulder that is ten points of piercing  damage i need you to make a constitution saving 
none	 throw  taliesin one of those again okay ten points of damage and a constitution saving throw  travis singing roll high you bluehaired motherfucker  sam its like blue and purple  taliesin im going to do a resolve  matt okay to take that saving throw again go for it  taliesin thats even worse do i have to take the worse one for the resolve  matt its whatever you rolled the second time i think  taliesin can i burn another resolve just to fuck it because this is annoying me  liam if its like 
none	 luck its a no  matt let me double check just a moment  laura does it petrify you  taliesin ill find out  matt all right so this is your indomitable not resolve your indomitable you must use the new roll  taliesin okay thats a 12  matt a 12 no all right so as the poison courses through your body the stinger itself  pulling forth you see a bit of blackgreenish liquid spill out as it pulls itself out of the  wound you suffer 24 points of poison damage as it then lifts back 
none	 up out of range and is going to  circle around you guys all still running you see percy get hit  sam can i take my fireball shot  matt you can now because it was coming very close before you had the opportunity to hit it  swings up past and you can now reaching behind get a fireball wand shot if you want  sam i will take my fireball wand shot  liam how high in the air is it  matt at this point now as it swooped past its about 40 45 feet away 
none	 a safe enough distance for  the fireball to not blow up his own party  sam its got a dc of 15 that wand  matt that is a no it rolled a three so go ahead and roll damage  sam can i fire more than one charge or should i have said that already  matt you should have said that at the beginning its a basic  sam never mind so its 8d6 right  matt 8d6 you got it and what are you doing vax  liam if i can attack im throwing daggers  
none	 matt yeah you can do that as it sweeps past after getting the rapid stinger into the chest  liam first gets 26 second is a 19  matt okay both hit  liam okay dagger dagger dagger  sam 33  liam 14 for the first and the second is eight thats it its within 40 feet you said  matt yeah as it swoops past  liam i am going to channel divinity and use a vow of oh i cant can i ditch the second attack  matt nah youve already confirmed it  sam also matthew 
none	 i dont know if this affects anything i am exhausted does that change  anything  matt correct you have one point of exhaustion which means that your ability checks are at  disadvantage keyleth grog do you guys want to do anything while it passes overhead  marisha you go first  travis no please ladies first no i insist  marisha okay i run to percy and i grab and pick him up and keep running and i say let me know if  youre poisoned  taliesin do i feel  matt it was a burning pain 
none	 through your body but it subsided after the original poison coursed  through your body so you fought it off sufficiently afterward  marisha okay i help him up and i say come on and we keep running  matt okay you guys keep running grog  travis the one that vax shot that hit the ground  laura im vex  travis yeah whatever  matt yeah thats 200 feet behind you  travis oh its 200 feet  matt you guys have been running this whole time as it went overhead and crashed into the ground  behind 
none	 you  travis oh im good  matt okay you guys just keep running okay so as you guys continue to run forward it swings  around after the fireball detonates and you see it wobble in the air for a second 33 points the  rider has turned to ash blown off the top of it the wyvern however has still found its target  and turns around and on its own is swooping back towards the group of you guys youre now about  halfway towards the front gate of the keep of fort daxio you guys both 
none	 percy and vex with ranged  weapons you can take your shot now as its turning around and returning to you guys still  charging forward  laura hunters mark  matt all right so you move your hunters mark over to that guy go for it  laura 25  matt that hits  laura 23  matt all right 23 damage nice all righty  laura on the first arrow  matt yes second one  laura that is what 23 yeah 23  travis and laura 22  matt right so theres five plus three for this 
none	 and its plus eight damage oh to hit okay  both hit i was like thats really high damage for arrows my apologies  travis two ones in a row  laura shut up ugh 13  matt 13 damage  laura three ones in a row  travis i guess youve got to throw those dice away only 900 left  matt so running forward you turn around behind over your shoulder you switch your actual direction  of arrows you normally fire with and turn the other way both arrows sink into it and you see it  
none	 wobble in the air percy  taliesin im going to take on the falldown i put bad news away and i pull animus out because  its closer now so i can take easier pot shots at it 31  matt hits  taliesin how many shots can i take a full round of shots or  matt you can if you want to  taliesin ill take a full round 31 26  matt 26 hits  taliesin and 33  matt all three hit go ahead and roll damage  taliesin where are my d10s at thats not 
dung	 a d10 there we go thats three shots its 17  sam so much math  taliesin im making sure i do this right because 24 points 34 points 41 points of  damage plus  matt not on one hit thats all of his attacks  taliesin three its three yeah 41 points of damage plus ten points of psychic damage  matt nice  taliesin that was three shots  matt all righty so all three shots pelt it in the chest you can see giant sections of its meaty  chest blown open and its streaking dark 
none	 wyvern blood behind it however its still flying the  fervor on its face as its near death is causing it to get more intense as it swoops down toward  you streaking out the tail ends up curling beneath its going to take a shot toward you  percy as you were the one that most recently hit it and did the most damage with the bite that is  a 24 to hit  taliesin oh that hits  matt and the stinger is at only a 13 to hit  taliesin that does not hit  matt 
none	 so the stinger seeing it coming this way you duck out of the way however its giant wyvern  jaws clamp down and streak across your shoulder as the momentum pulls it past dragging it across the  back for that you suffer ten points of piercing damage  marisha thats not too bad  matt as it comes down at that point its back in range for any of you melee folk that want to take  a swing at it grog  travis can i rage and can i take a swing at falcor please  matt yes 
none	 you can  travis okay lovely  liam we have no initiative so i dont know whos where am i close enough to go after grog  matt yes im keeping tabs because this is more of a flyby as you guys are running  travis could i make it a reckless attack please  matt sure yeah a lot of these are happening simultaneously  travis 25  matt that hits go ahead and roll damage  travis nine 22 plus two points of necrotic 24  matt okay as it swoops down and bites into percys arm as 
none	 it drags up in the air you watch  as a very fastrunning grog whos been ahead of the group at this point his speed is higher than  anybody spins around axe in the air and carves right through the front of its chest to its back  it screeching and slides into two pieces that then scatter into the ground smearing black  darkness across the dry desert floor you guys continue to run forward currently all your  harrying wyverns are way too far behind and damaged or not paying attention before you guys  are just 
none	 now reaching the outside of the busted fort daxio outer wall where the front gates are  collapsed inward and slightly burned  travis didnt seem like that big of a problem that was not so tough  laura theres a hundred more guys inside grog  travis i know you keep saying that number like i know what it means so lets get it on  marisha grog grog 100 needs three hands to make  travis how many hands  marisha it needs  travis how many  laura keep running  marisha okay keep running keep running 
none	  taliesin its not helpful  matt you guys all go into the front gates  laura im on the broom so im up and over the wall  matt okay you come up over the top of the wall as you get up over the top immediately you see  they have two large ballistae the number of ballistae installed throughout the walls here two  of them have already been torn apart and whoever was manning them is lying on the ground torn open  and dead but you do also see other dead lizardmen it looks like 
none	 a fight has been  going on for a short time here and has been a back and forth as you guys come into the main courtyard  you find the ground is charred with small flames that are still burning on bushes and elements of  piles of broken wood and things that were part of the encampment that just caught fire you can see  groups of lizardmen battling various soldiers some of them still screaming and the sound of  lizardlike battle cries as they charge in slamming weapon against weapon shield against  face this is 
none	 an actual smallscale war happening inside here its hard to tell which side is  winning a lot of the soldiers are bettertrained but occasionally you watch as a wyvern swoops down  and picks up a soldier and throws them off the side and slams into the ground no longer  moving  marisha do we see anyone we know  sam wheres elle  marisha do we see allura  matt perception check  marisha come on opal dice thats not bad 26  sam oh disadvantage  matt disadvantage for you buddy  sam oh okay 14 
none	  matt okay so the two of you as soon as you dart inside and glance over you can see nobody that  catches your familiar eye everyone who is in armor is in full armor theyre all in the actual  fort daxio defense regalia and they are covered in blood theyre covered in soot and they are not  paying attention to you because they are fighting for their lives right now you can see there are  a number of tents to the side dried trees that have burnt out entirely you can see a number of 
none	 the  trebuchets that you have repaired earlier that have already torn down or at least have suffered  partial damage from fire or other elements bludgeoning  marisha but there doesnt seem to be any tabards from emon or any tabards from syngorn or anything  like that  matt no it looks like when this began currently only daxios army was here and is here  currently  marisha i mean that still sucks but okay  matt yeah you do watch and see as currently there is no tension toward you because the battles  happening right 
none	 now are still happening you see multiple soldiers gathering around wyverns that  have been dragged to the ground with chain or have nets thrown over them and soldiers are gashing running  up and slashing and stabbing as they can while the lizardman carves its way through and takes its  spear and starts piercing out with its shield as you look around nothing but insanity going  around what are you guys doing  laura are there any clusters that look like not a lot of our soldiers around just lizardmen or is  it all mixed in

dung	 needs to happen its the impact so  you do take four points of piercing damage as you try and catch it from the front of the blade in  your hand and the speed at which its thrown is you feel the impact  laura and then i brace the broom to catch him  matt at which point the blade all of a sudden swirls with dark shadow energy and your brother  appears at your side  liam and i would like to use my bonus action to cast lay on hands and give her four hit 
none	 points  laura aww buddy laughs thats so great  liam thats it just four i get to choose how many  laura thanks i catch him on the broom and hand him the  liam and ill use my movement to scooch my uncomfortable crotch onto this stick you ride all  over the place groans  matt all righty your movement is now on the broom reduced to 20 feet with two people on it  liam cool  laura what are you going to do  matt at which point you see the wyverns and the riders 
none	 start thrashing about some of them have  spears thatre jamming out from the middle of the net you watch as this guy spins around and takes  out three out of the guards that all just collapse to the ground one takes a stinger to the face  another one gets bitten and has its head broken in the process while a third one gets a spear to the  front of the chest  marisha this wyvern asshole did that  matt over here yeah hes hurt but hes been taking out a lot of the guards along 
none	 the way the  rest of these lizard guards do a full double dash this way past that guard there whos giving  chase these guys all rush up to try and make their way to the front door again they cant  really do anything yet to the door but they can get there at this point in time  sam oh boy  matt vex vax  laura yeah  matt from your vantage point up at the top on the broom you hear this distant echoing horn  sound this low horn noise  laura shit  
none	 matt its echoing through the valley you glance over your shoulder and you see a bead of burning  red light making its way in your direction wings flapping its closer than you think and as it  comes closer and closer towards you  laura thordak comes and kills us all right  marisha yeah this is happy 2016  matt you feel the blood rush from your face as your immediate instinct is oh god the cinder  king is here while there are flames involved the size is not as immense as you would expect  from 
dung	 thordak instead what you see is a large red winged bird with flames trailing off the  edges of its wings flapping in your direction coming over the wall on the outside of the  fortress on its back you see a humanoid but much larger than anyone of your size armored with dark  black and grayishsilvertrimmed iron armor a giant maul in one hand itself reddish flamelike  hair this is a fire giant similar to the ones you encountered in the city of brass riding on  the back of this emberroctype creature as it comes cruising 
none	 over the top you hear it holding  a horn in its other hand start shouting out the cinder king calls for swift execution i deliver  his hate with absolute strength and it swoops into a dive toward the front side of the gate at  a full speed at this point it coasts right beneath both of you swinging the hammer in the  air i need both of you guys to make dexterity saving throws  liam would evasion work for this  matt no well evasion is against any spell  liam spell thats what i 
none	 thought i just wanted to check  laura do we get advantage for anything  matt let me check quick laughs you do not get advantage for anything  laura laughs why though  matt but i admire you checking for any given possibility  laura 16 for me  liam im going to use my last luck  sam you have inspiration  liam oh i do and i can add it to that save right  sam sure  liam good oh then im 29 i rolled 11 off of that thanks for the limerick  matt whatd 
none	 you roll  laura 16  matt 16 okay so you manage to lift up onto the broom almost doing a complete handstand to get  out of the way however the bottom of it catches your sister in the side of her leg causes the  broom to lurch and begin to lose control of it you both manage to hold on to the broom  laura thats good  matt but you from the impact of the hammer do suffer 16 points of bludgeoning damage as the  bird now in a full dive slams in a giant 
none	 fiery crash into the front two gates of the keep  liam how close was it to us if it hit us  matt it swooped right underneath you  liam can i do an attack of opportunity  matt no because you were trying to get out of the way  liam all right  matt to do that you would have been fully off the broom and you would fall  liam understand understand  matt as it swoosh into this full dive slams into the two front gates which explode into a  cloud of dust broken 
none	 rock masonry and iron you watch as the dust settles briefly now the giant  is stepping off of the back of this giant flaming bird and looks around clutching its hammer in its hand  laura fuck  yelling  sam thats large thats like from a different set of action figures  travis i think the scale is wrong matt i think you accidentally put things that are bigger than  us on the map  laura this is like when i made my barbies date my gi joes  laughter  marisha why is gi joe so 
none	 much shorter than barbie damn it  taliesin did the lizard man take damage by the way  matt actually yeah as the dust clears the lizard men that were at the gate were all  destroyed in the impact crushed their bones broken and you can see one arm twitching out of  the center of the rubble the doors are currently blown open and off the hinges there  laura fuck  matt all righty and then  sam we need some sort of miracle here what we need is some sort of miracle  matt fresh off 
none	 the airplane  ashley hello everybody  liam divine intervention  sam singing we need a hero  matt that is awesome  ashley ive lost my voice a little bit but you know what fuck it dernder  matt i want a shirt that says that fuck it dernder  travis theyll get that in the store as soon as possible  matt indeed all righty so bringing us to the top as they both stand there the flames still  emanating out from the impact the lizardmen scattered and broken at the gate the battle still  waging 
none	 on in the vicinity you see as two other battles over here the wyvern rider on this wyvern  is stabbed in the head and is killed the wyvern is still around but it takes another guard out  behind it over here this guy continues to fight and takes out two of the guards but there is  still one behind that is holding strong top of the round vex what do you want to do as you  just barely gather control over the broom again  laura is that within range of you to throw something at

none	 heat of the bird behind you the giant emberroc you would take eight points of fire  damage but its reduced to four because of your armors fire resistance so thats four points of  fire damage  ashley so i have a quick question  matt yes  ashley so the thing that percy was trying to do with the trebuchet did it not work because it  wasnt  taliesin because im weak  ashley youre weak okay i want to try and give it a go  matt okay by the way your sword should have attacked 
none	 last round when you summoned it so go  ahead and make a spell attack with it just because i totally forgot about that  ashley ugh what do i roll  matt just roll a d20 and add your spell attack modifier youre up next grog  ashley ooh 28  matt that hits go ahead and roll the damage for your spiritual weapon  ashley 2d6  matt that is 1d8 plus five  ashley eight  matt all right so thats an additional eight points of damage to the giant okay so  continuing your turn

none	 it right at the fire bird  matt okay as you pull the winch around and theres a little trigger underneath as you get it  in place thats kind of holding it  ashley bink  matt as pike bink the trebuchet the sudden momentum of the direct inertia to momentum the  device spins over top and lobs this large boulder within this giant sling over and slamming right  towards the face of the emberroc thats an 18 go ahead and roll 4d12 damage  sam heavy duty d12s  matt its a siege weapon man  
none	 laura thats 4d12 right there  matt its meant to destroy walls  sam wow  ashley 27  matt 27 points of bludgeoning damage to the emberrocs face as it slams in the rock breaks  across its skull and its head rears back from the impact and it stumbles back a bit shaking its  head you can see part of its beak is cracked now from the impact blinking its eyes and shrieking  marisha oh buddy  matt no its trying to kill your friends  ashley wait arent we attacking him  matt you can 
none	 still move if youd like and you have your bonus action to move your sword over if  youd like  ashley okay bonus action is there only one charge on that thing can i keep doing it or no  matt every round it lasts for a minute  ashley okay i guess for my bonus action im going to cast shield of faith on percy  matt okay for the spiritual weapon just so you know  laura ill bet thats concentration  matt well no its not concentration but you can choose to use your bonus action 
none	 to have the sword  attack or cast a spell and the sword just does nothing  ashley i guess its not going to help you im going to use the spiritual weapon  matt okay so the bonus action is the sword toward the giant or the bird  ashley toward the giant  matt the sword swings out of the way arcs through the air roll another spell attack  ashley 16  matt 16 does not hit  ashley im going to use guided strike to add ten  matt okay  ashley oh but no i 
none	 dont want to is it too late to retract that  matt if you want to  ashley i wanted to use that for something bigger  travis something bigger than the fire giant  laura something bigger than the spiritual weapon  ashley its not going to do that much damage  taliesin yeah something that does more damage than the spiritual weapon  matt yeah i mean you dont have to its up to you  ashley no its okay ill wait for something bigger  matt okay so the blade arcs over and slams into the armor 
none	 of the giant and the giant kind of  shrugs it off no damage you just couldnt quite impact against the creatures flesh you still can  move if you want to  ashley im going to stay  matt youre going to stay there  ashley yeah  matt okay the trebuchet is expended by the way it would have to be loaded and to load that  thing it takes quite a few people just so youre aware its probably not going to be useful again  in this battle  there are other weapons in the field 
none	  liam everybody to the trebuchet  marisha all hands on deck  matt heave ho all right pike that ends your turn  ashley well ill move out a little bit then i didnt know it would take so much towards the  giant  matt okay  ashley i dont know why  matt thats about as far as you can get there  ashley all right  matt staying in melee range of the creature or do you want to leave its melee range it will get a  strike at you if you do actually it 
none	 will not because it already stuck at percy so you can go  there youre fine all right that ends your turn grog youre up  travis i see the giant eyeing scanlan and im like i thought you said i was your charge you  are not cheating on me this early in our relationship and i take both of my attacks at  general hot fire giants face reckless great weapon master  matt go for it  travis 30 minus five is 25  matt hits  travis 26 minus five is 21  matt hits  
none	 travis awesome  34 for the first one with six points of necrotic 41  matt 41 points of damage on that one  travis i rolled a d12 plus 13  matt oh a straight 12 on that one oh thats nasty all right you still have your bonus  action  travis i do i would like to hit him again  matt okay  travis not that great 21  matt that hits  travis 26 with five points of necrotic  matt 26 points of damage  ashley jeez  marisha lets take this bird down 
dung	  matt you did over 100 points of damage in one round of combat  all what  ashley thats so much grog  travis look i am a onefiregiant kind of guy i get very upset about these things  matt so with bigbys hand floating on one side and a glowing sword on the other the giant  focusing on scanlan you get angry and just release this torrent of strikes pulling back  from the blade you can see dark blood begin to pour from the plates and the giant is wounded but  its grinning and 
none	 its attention swings back to you  travis i told you i was worth a date  matt all right that ends your turn grog  travis yeah thats it  matt all right the bird who has watched pike run past after being slammed in the face by the  trebuchet angrily steps forward here first lets see if it regenerates that it does recover its  inferno ability however it is going to unleash a bite and two claw attacks on you that is a  natural 20 on the bite  travis no pike  matt that 
none	 is a 19 to hit on the first claw attack  ashley no  matt and that is a 23 to hit so a bite and a claw attack the bite is a critical  unfortunately so as that one comes to strike you that is 19 plus 2d8 fire damage so you take 30  points of slashing damage  ashley okay  matt plus ten points of fire damage reduced to half so five actually it would have been 20 so  thats ten points of fire damage  ashley i have resistance to fire  matt right 
none	 it would have been 20  travis okay  laura but then because he did a melee attack on you  ashley yeah he did a melee attack so the attacker suffers 2d6  matt is that fire damage  ashley yeah  matt you watch as theres a burst of flame but it seems to have no affect on the creature  ashley okay  matt this creature is fire by nature  travis naughty by nature  matt possibly all right and its going to begin flanking around you  laura damn it  matt after it does 
none	 its strikes it stomps that brings us to the top of the round now this  guy is going to spend his turn loading up and then taking another shot at the bird there that one  unfortunately goes wide it fires and slams into the ground and a big cloud of dust and rock gets  thrown into the air as the large bolt jettisons into the floor wasted shot there this wyvern  over here is going to fly up  laura and attack me  matt no hes going to go after keyleth the air elemental form

none	 as she pulls backwards exposes further up and you just drive the blade upward as  you do you catch some sort of heavy vein as blood begins to just gout out of the wound and you keep  pushing upward it wont go much past the thigh at this point but she turns around and starts going  unconscious from the rapid blood loss based on the wounds shes already sustained she takes her  hammer up to deliver a death blow down upon you and as she goes to reach for you her fingers lack  the strength 
none	 to hold the blade and she tumbles forward you pass to the side sidestepping as her  form slams into the dirt knocking up dust around her on the ground  air horn  laughter  matt vex i need you to go ahead and roll a wisdom saving throw  liam because i stabbed you  laura roll low roll low oh i mean roll high roll high wisdom saving throw 15  matt 15 does not make it however technically and this was my fault before you do have  advantage because it is a person who is 
none	 not your ally or theyre fighting your allies  laura thats even worse  matt yep so youre still dominated sorry  liam but at least you lost some hit points  laura yay  liam seven  laura i saw  matt all right so that ends vaxs turn keyleth youre up  marisha okay so i have the wyvern in my face  matt you do yes and the wyvern rider  marisha and the wyvern rider im going to do two slam attacks  matt to the wyvern or the rider  marisha what looks worse

none	 take  matt theyve got a fair amount of hit points for their size but their armor class isnt huge  marisha okay cool so the first one is good 13 plus five so 18 for the first hit  matt okay  marisha and four plus three is seven plus five is 12 12 for the second  matt gotcha all right  marisha and then im going to use a bonus action i have never done this before im going to use a  bonus action as a circle of the moon druid to use one spell slot 
none	 to heal 1d8 hit points  matt okay go for it  marisha ooh seven thats good  matt all righty so as you slam the wyvern twice whack whack you can see its being  buffeted the wings are trying to keep up from the sheer amount of wind thats swirling around it the  blows are almost knocking the rider off and hes spent most of his round trying to hold on to it  its looking pretty rough its barely keeping itself up in the air but its still standing in  front of you  marisha 
town	 awesome  matt all right that ends your turn keyleth all right  marisha im going to keep him locked down  matt okay it is not the generals turn because the general is currently dead percival  taliesin im going to peek out the tent just one step i can see that the wyvern i take a look at  the field and i see that  marisha sorry sorry sorry jesus  taliesin okay so thats happening but i can see that we have a problem with scanlan so im going  to take some shots at the 
none	 creatures that are attacking scanlan im going to attack the wyvern  not the rider  matt okay  taliesin first shot actually you know what i havent tried this yet and this could be fun im  going to try a piercing shot and see if i can hit the rider and the wyvern  matt i will say that yes you can because they occupy the same space  taliesin so starting with the wyvern and then all right come on dont be an asshole eh  thats not terrible 19  matt 19 hits so roll also 
none	 for the  taliesin oh for the rider thats 25  matt also hits so with a single shot it shoots through the neck and actually pierces the shoulder  of the rider at the same time  laura thats sick  matt roll damage once and itll go for both of them  taleisin so thats okay thats 11 points of damage and three points of psychic damage  matt okay so they both take a total of 14 points of damage it hits them both the rider is looking  really messed up from the impact it looks 
none	 like it hit something on the neck and is now bleeding onto  its chest it looks a little dazed from the impact the wyvern is hurt wounded and the other  guards are still stabbing at it with their weapons so its not quite at deaths door but  its looking pretty  taliesin im going to take another double shot at the two of them thats a 26 to hit  matt hits all right  taliesin and then the second one which jumped is 30 to hit  matt okay so roll damage and then they both 
none	 take the next hit  taliesin better 15 points of normal damage three points of psychic damage  matt so 18 total this time as the wyvern rears up from the damage from the first impact the pain  causing it to put its wings out and puff up it goes through the wing and takes out the temple of  the rider the rider is immediately killed and falls off the back  taliesin which means i still have one shot left  matt the wyvern is now in the process of trying to get its wings up its 
none	 realized how badly its  hurt and is going to attempt to flee  taliesin thats fine im going to take one more shot im going to do a sharpshooter shot at the  wyvern im also going to just to be an asshole im going to do a push shot at him im going to  do a torso push so thats doublechecking okay thats fucking terrible god damn it again  matt again hes going to aim and the same mechanism youre having a reverse percy day  wow there is balance  taliesin and another ten points 
town	 of psychic damage  liam this is just balancing for the thordak fight its all right  taliesin and ive lost that grit point because i burned that grit point on the bird so ow run  back in the tent god damn it  matt all right that finishes percys turn  taliesin and deep into the tent like halfway into the tent  matt scanlan youre up  sam im up  matt just curled up and shaking  sam okay my bigbys hand is still working right  matt yeah you didnt break concentration  sam i 
none	 can move it how far  matt you can move it  sam move it up to 60 feet is that going to get back to me in time  matt to you yeah you can get it to anything in the battlefield  sam i want it to do a 60foot punch on the wyvern in front of me  matt go ahead and roll  travis hadouken  sam okay  travis tiger  taliesin i did well and then i jammed again ive done like 30 points of damage to myself  sam oh wait i have 
none	 to do a spell attack first  laura ive done more than that to everybody else  sam no 15  matt 15 hits armor class is low on the wyverns  sam so then oh its a lot its already up to 26 oh 42  matt okay the wyvern begins lifting up in the air trying to escape now its sitting here  whipping out the guards are backing up afraid to get too close you see scanlan concentrating as  the wyvern gets about 15 feet off the ground bigbys hand swoops up grabs it and then 
none	 plants  it right onto the jagged rock behind it piercing it  travis you made wyvern juice  matt it weakly goes limp against the bladed rock  laura sick  matt that was your bonus action you still have your action and your movement if you like the  two guards next to you are like were at your aid sir  sam i might need it flank me were going into battle  travis flank me i dont think that means what you think it means  sam so ill i still have an action right  
none	 matt action and movement yeah  sam i should probably heal myself right nah ill run toward the fight oh wait theres a  wyvern right there isnt there ooh i dont want them to kill me  marisha theres also a wyvern on my ass  sam all right ill attack the wyvern next to marishas ass i mean keyleths ass with another  lightning bolt  matt okay  sam i have one more level three spell  matt all righty so the wyvern makes a not with a two it doesnt and for the rider the rider 
none	  does get a natural 20 so it does take half damage  sam okay so 8d6 i got it  liam whats it like looking at this shirtmare all night  matt im trying not to  liam hey my eyes are up here  matt its a great exercise in focus  sam 23  matt i hate you so much with that the rider takes the impact of the lightning bolt and whips  its head back around angrily however the wyvern beneath it gets blasted by the bolt of lightning  and throws it back the 
none	 rider gets just enough back and the wyvern falls to the ground  unconscious and slowly dying  marisha you got that wyvern on my ass thanks man  sam and then i use my movement to grab both of the guards and cower behind them close them like  a door in front of me  matt okay so you move behind them guarding you right there you now have two bodyguards flanking  you at that moment all right it is xanthas turn now  laura groaning i mean hes so cool but i mean he sucks a 
none	 little bit  marisha hes not that cool  laura no i mean hes really cool you guys hes the coolest  matt he sees the giant fall but the firebird is still in combat theres other wyverns floating  around some being taken down in the distance from other guards it looks like the tide of battle is  shifting now at this point you guys in helping out the guys around you both gave a morale boost  and shifted the tide you can see the other wyverns the lizardmen have been for the most  part dispatched 
none	 within the courtyard around you however xanthas looking down and seeing the  circumstance kind of uh um argh releases his hand this is going to be against you vax  this is going to be a chain lighting  liam i will use evasion of course  laura thats good thats good  matt thats a good call on that one all right chain lightings a little bit of a bitch here  let me pull it up there we go sixth level all right so i need vax grog and pike to all make  dexterity saving throws 
none	  laura roll so high  travis danger sense  sam ashley johnson  laura ashley jenkins  ashley 15  liam i didnt do too well i only got 14  travis 17  matt okay both of you fail what did you get  liam 14  matt all three of you fail  liam half damage for me  travis whatd you have to roll to succeed  ashley i was just going to take my turn  matt i know well that is 50 points  travis five zero  matt five zero 50 points of

none	 take fire damage  matt or take fire damage yeah it doesnt affect the creature you guys watch as the lightning  streaks out from the top of the wall slams into the back of vax who you arc up your whole body  seizing at the sudden burst of electrical energy which then bursts outward into grog and pike  grog it hits you and your muscles tense and you drop the axe for a second you reach down and push  through the pain and pick it back up pike it slams into you and you watch as 
none	 the light shines  up around you the smoke emanating from underneath the plate armor you fall to the ground theres a  brief moment of silence and then suddenly this bright reddishorange energy bursts out from  beneath the armor through the neck through the sides of the plate and you lift up about three or  four feet off the ground before landing back on the ground restored with a little bit of health  this burst of flame arcs out around you  travis jean grey thats amazing  ashely i growl  matt xanthas then goes 
none	 okay and darts back inside  laura i hate him  ashley hes the worst  matt all right that brings us to pike  ashley okay i sound so puny with this voice im going to try my tried and true pal guiding bolt  im going to guiding bolt at fifth level right in the belly of the beast  matt so youre going to turn around to this giant angry emberroc and guiding bolt it into  the stomach all righty lets get over here for that assault at fifth level you said all  righty that 
none	 would be 8d6 radiant damage if you hit you make a ranged spell attack it is right  up against you in a ranged format so youre probably going to have to step back because it is  ranged or its disadvantage to hit up to you  laura dont take a step back hell hit you  ashley maybe hell fail  marisha would he get a strike of opportunity on her  matt he might its your call or take disadvantage on the strike because it is a ranged  attack  marisha wait wait is it the 
none	 big bird he might have reach it might not be out of his range  matt if youre still within melee with him youll have to step out of melee to not get the  disadvantage in doing that he might get an attack of opportunity on you its not just within  five feet its getting out of the creatures ability  ashley ill do the disadvantage  matt okay go ahead and roll twice adding your spell attack  marisha big money no whammies  ashley adding my spell attack okay so 14  matt okay roll again 
none	  laura no that was with disadvantage  ashley i rolled two at the same time  matt oh with disadvantage that does hit actually  ashley it does  matt just barely it doesnt have a high armor  ashley ooh okay so 8d6 okay so how many of these counting oh these were bad rolls well  thats a counting  sam no break tonight guys  matt nope sorry weve been off for two weeks  ashley do i add anything its just those 22  matt 22 points of radiant damage against it as you blast 
none	 it this giant flash of divine energy  bursts around it causing this glittering beacon the next attack against it has advantage period  you can see the creature itself its flames are starting to flicker it looks angry and it looks  wounded that end your turn pike are you going to move oh you can bonus action with the sword  toward it and attack it if you want so go ahead and make another spell attack  ashley okay guh  laura that hit because you needed a 14  ashley oh yeah  matt so 1d8 
none	 plus five if its higher than what you last rolled  ashley 1d8 plus five  matt grog youre up next  travis yep  ashley 11  matt 11 to hit  ashley no 11 damage  matt oh damage sorry 11 damage to the creature so as the blade arcs past striking  again you can see another flash of divine energy technically that wouldve had advantage i just  realized because thats the next attack against it so roll again  ashley roll that again  matt roll the d20 again  laura oh because if you 
none	 get a critical  ashley ooh yeah that hits  matt okay so its fine i was seeing if it was going to critical or not  ashley so another oh oh sorry  matt yeah because the guiding bolt gave advantage on the next attack and the next attack  was the sword so the beacon fades it is now grogs turn  travis stupid big bird i run over and i would like to hit the giant flaming piece of shit  reckless great weapon master all the lasagna 31 minus five is 27  matt that hits

dung	 in the battle  ashley oh im using my mace of disruption  matt so as the mace comes through it slams into the side of the skull of the ember roc your hands  go numb from the impact as the vibration shivers through your body you watch as the beak and the  side of the skull crack and cave inward with a little squeak sound it just falls over on the  ground  ahsley yeah grog it felt like i did it  travis you did do it monstah give me a growl  ashley arrr

none	 guy on the ground right under my face  sam you two go kill that guy ill go somewhere else  matt okay they both using their full  liam just killed a pit fiend  matt they get all the way up to it they dont have a chance to attack but theyre surrounding  it with their weapons drawn theyre going to probably brutalize it pretty badly next round all  right for the purposes of this round too you hear a sound from up in the hallway where xanthas  was pained shout you watch as xanthas 
none	 goes flying out a few feet and lands on his back you  watch as a small brown bit of hair races across a giant gleaming holy avenger goes across the air  travis yes platinum greatsword  laura who was it its kima  matt its kima  yelling  matt she says bahamut strike you down you knifeeared son of a bitch the blade coming down  sam defenestrated  laughter  matt here we go that is a 15 to hit that hits against his armor class and a natural 20  marisha get it girl

none	 first hit the second one does not  laura yes  matt its half damage he rolled a ten he needed to roll 13 or higher  marisha that was on the critical right  matt yeah it was on the critical so the concentration spell ends you have control of your  mind again  laura tell me its my turn  matt after that and kima unloading on him yes it is  ashley yeah get him  travis how many points of damage did he take  matt from that total round with the divine smite from 
none	 her strike he took 62 points of damage from her  laura im gonna fly right above him and shoot directly down onto his face  matt okay  laughter  matt you coast over looking down at him on the ground he is prone currently so you have  disadvantage on the attacks  laura triumphant laughter and kimas standing next to him  matt yeah  matt disadvantage  laura oh hes prone  matt hes prone  laura why do i get disadvantage because hes prone  matt its ranged attack so when things are on the 
none	 ground theyre a little harder  liam if kimas next to him as a rogue does it cancel out and she gets advantage from her ally  matt you dont get advantage from an ally being adjacent you get to sneak attack them if theyre  adjacent  liam thanks  matt no worries  sam you got this  laura psh six no 18  matt hits his armor class isnt very high hes a little mage dude  laura 18 and the other one definitely hits 20  matt yeah both still hit with disadvantage  travis nice

none	 this  cheering  marisha he was always an asshole always  laura thats right im gonna say i always thought you were a dick back in emon dont fuck  with me then i shoot him straight through the face  matt as hes on the ground  taliesin his heart breaks before the arrow hits  laughter  marisha he always had a crush on you  laughter  matt he puts his finger up as you nock the first arrow and he goes wait i and the first arrow  hits him in the shoulder hes like 
dung	 no nervous laughter we can and he gets that far into the  second sentence before the arrow impact through his face whimpers trails off and the finger  goes limp as his eyes go a little dead in the face  liam slightly sad  laura i turn back round and i go sorry grog  matt kima looks up and you and goes frustrated noise he was mine  laura no kima he was mine  laughter  matt she takes the blade and impact stabs him anyway  laughter  matt you see some of the wyverns 
none	 the few surviving now are starting to scatter and head  back towards emon it looks like the ranks have broken and the tide has definitely turned at this  point as you all begin to gather yourselves the last lizard man on the ground over there is just  being repeatedly stabbed by the guards until its no longer moving and bludgeoned by the air  elemental thats lording over it you begin to gather yourselves to consider the next course of  action were going to take a quick bathroom break  laura at ten oclock a bathroom 
none	 break  marisha quick bathroom break  sam we need a pause  matt theres a little more in store here well be back here in a minute guys well see you in a sec  break  matt hello everyone and welcome back we have returned from our break real fast we had two  winners we had one winner from last week since we had no episode so we did two this time in the  chat the winners are super gimpo man who won a flamebox elder hero vault from wyrmwood and we  have a second 
none	 winner is southern dragon 22 won a purple heart dice box  sam thats the one that i have  matt its that color right there for one of the deckboxes so super gimpo man and southern dragon  22 congratulations well done  marisha it does grant you cock lightning thats true its like a 5thlevel spell  matt all right guys so the dust of the battle settling the plumes of smoke slowly beginning to  dissipate as the fires burn out from the previous struggle the remaining living soldiers begin to  gather their dead and wounded 
none	 and you guys begin to reconvene as allies towards the broken front  doors to the outside of fort daxio  laura i search xanthas body  matt you search his body  laura yeah  matt all righty  sam ill search the giant  marisha can i scavenge from the emberroc  matt sure if you want to  travis could i ask pike to heal me a little bit please  ashley oh yeah where are you at  travis oh you know like a twodigit number  liam what  matt how many points do you 
none	 have grog  travis 25  matt 25 hitpoints on grog  sam i got nine  laura oh no he asked does that mean that somethings going to happen right now  matt i dont know  laura we need to sleep lets all sleep lets go to sleep right now  matt right now it doesnt work that way all right so as you guys are looting the giant has  giant black iron plate mail on which is very heavy it is its going to take a few hands to  pull off  travis not if 
none	 we tagteam  matt as well as her great maul which is also very large  liam gauche  matt and about 812 gold pieces  liam ill take those  travis like so big that i couldnt even wield it  matt you could hold it but you couldnt wield it yes sizewise its maybe about three feet  taller than you from head to pommel and the weight of it is unwieldy for your size  travis 30 points  ashley i heal him 30 points with my last  matt okay you find on xanthas you find 
none	 1098 gold pieces  sam ill take that  matt you find a potion of superior healing that he didnt have a chance to use and there appears  to be a wand that is shattered  marisha take it  laura im taking it of course im taking it  matt it looks like it has broken and theres a little bit of a burn mark on the wood the wand was  crafted from  laura okay i inspect it it doesnt do anything when i inspect it  matt okay make an arcana check  laura okay 
none	  liam take a look hermione  laura but im doing it because grog told me to and hes brilliant  travis i know  laura 11  liam check out the brain on vex  matt definitely busted and it was once a wand  laura cool cool cool  travis are you sure its not a twig  matt i hate you so much sam nothing continue  travis he never saw the bottom of it until now  matt no not until now  sam oh is that true  matt yeah ive been focused on other 
none	 things  sam i printed some extras for you matt like sign them for fans its high derp  matt i blame you internet youre partially responsible for this oh boy some things never die  liam thats a legacy  matt it is a legacy its true its pretty great one of the downsides of having hundreds of  hours of video of you on the internet is those are everywhere  liam weve all made awful faces and said stupid things  matt its wonderful im glad you guys have come to enjoy it  marisha theyve all 
none	 seen us pick our noses  matt probably yeah somebody do a supercut please  taliesin dont  matt too late guys  taliesin youre a horrible person i have two guns to fix at some point  matt okay go ahead and make some repair checks while youre working on that  taliesin okay do i get a bonus if im not in the middle of combat or is that still the same  tinkering check  matt same tinkering check  taliesin so number one yes that goes well thats a 17 that was on animus and then 
none	 bad  news which is slightly easier to fix does not fix  sam bad news  taliesin bad news is broken  matt yeah bad news youre going to need supplies to fix  taliesin yeah im going to need to sit there with some money and spend some time with it  matt okay  marisha hey mom i cleaned the dishes  ashley did we loot the giant  matt yes the giant was looted youre trying to carve something out of the emberroc  marisha yes i am nature check  matt go ahead and make 
none	 a nature check with advantage  marisha gil dont fuck me gil gil god damn it gil  laughter  marisha but with advantage it is a 25  matt okay its hard to pull a lot from the body because the nature of the emberroc as it passes  away parts of it begin to turn to ash but you do manage to pull from a portion of its torso whats  called emberroc oil it is a flammable liquid that burns like a napalm  marisha like napalm  matt you get about roughly a gallon of it 
none	 to extract because the rest of its ruined for it  its worth about 750 gold if you were to try and sell it its very volatile depending on how you  store it just so youre aware  sam cool man  liam oh man drop some mentos in there  marisha percy do you have any vials left  taliesin in theory i should have some vials left  sam can it hold a gallon  taliesin not a gallons worth  marisha not a gallon but i just want a couple and i hand a couple to 
none	 vex and vax just a couple  vials of the  matt so you guys have a vial of emberroc oil  marisha yep nitroglycerin  matt kind of in a way  marisha you can either make a really great molotov cocktail or maybe some flaming arrows  matt youre not certain the book that you have that details some of these creatures the thing  that you had found earlier in the campaign it doesnt tell you details of how the actual liquid  is triggered it just says that it is fiery and burns very hot  
none	 travis its like the goo from ghostbusters 2 talk angry  laura talk sweet  matt sure as you guys are taking this moment to figure this out eventually you hear what sounds  like the crumbling of stone and a few rocks tumble out of the broken open entrance to the  fortress and you watch as a couple of guards begin to come out their eyes wide they look like  they were in armor and ready to make the final stand among them you see general elle gorgofon  the female head of this particular regiment of 
none	 fort daxio and kima  marisha but what about allura  matt you see them all emerge from it elle looks out to them so youve done well little late  but thank you for the assist well begin to gather our dead she walks forward and gives you  all a nod as she puts her helmet back on puts her blade aside and begins helping their soldiers  begin to gather the dead in a pile kima steps up you can see her teeth are clenched and theres  still a shaking of rage in her fists and 
none	 what looks to be streaks of dried tears across her  cheek xanthas betrayed us all he arrived alone bloodied asked for aid and protection since  allura recognized him we let him in stayed here for a short time saying how bad things had become  in emon and spoke with allura alone something sensitive we found her ten minutes later come  with me  travis are you serious  matt she steps over the stone and leads you inside of the fortress she turns the corner  stops staring into the room as you guys approach motions 
none	 for you to follow her you walk  up to one of the small meeting chambers the one that you met elle with when you first arrived  here and as you begin to approach kima turns back and says its okay friends are here and  you walk in and you see allura sitting really scared in a corner in her robes sitting in a  chair with her knees pulled to her chest her eyes widen as she sees you all and she gets up from  her chair and runs over and the person whos probably the 
none	 first to walk in there would probably be  keyleth at this point and just wraps her arms around you and just holds you for a second and  shakes  marisha are you okay what happened we thought you were dead for a second  matt she backs away distressed sounds  marisha oh fuck oh fuck whats your name whats your name shes been feebleminded i turn  to kima was it feeblemind  matt i i dont know what that is i dont can you help her  marisha yes its a restoration spell  ashley yeah 
none	 im going to cast a greater restoration on her i have it can i well i  dont have any 5thlevel left yet wow i dont have any 5thlevel left but i have a seventh can i  cast it at a seventh  matt you do have a seventh  ashley yeah can i cast it at that  matt oh you can definitely cast it at a higher level it doesnt affect it but you can  sam no no it doesnt affect the power of the spell it doesnt make it a more powerful spell  ashley 
none	 this is so stressful  matt its all good so as you approach kima as you begin to walk forward your hands begin to  glow as you reach out your holy symbol beginning to burn with a bright whitishorange color that  mingles with the red and gold of the armor across your chest as the glow sparks in your fingers  she goes gasps  ashley its okay its okay im going to help you  marisha i try and calm her as best as i can to help pike any assistance i can provide  matt she 
none	 reaches forward slowly touches and grabs your hand and as it does you watch as the  light transfers from your hands and gauntlets into her arms and upper sleeves she winces from it  but you keep holding her tight and as it passes up through reaches her mind her face the glow  passes through and lifts off her like this gentle steam that lifts off her eyes roll back for a  second and close  you are a godsend my dear  ashley oh i grab her and hug her  matt she pulls you in 
none	 for a big hug and lifts you up off the ground for a second before youre  heavy now puts you back down  ashley i just have so much armor on  matt that you do that you do as she pulls back she looks at you all and immediately grog  and vex you feel yourselves pushed apart as kima rushes up and just grabs her around the side and  says dont do that again holds her for a second allura just rubs her head and says im  sorry i should have been careful we needed 
none	 allies i didnt know and kima says you shut  up and she reaches up and gives her a kiss she takes her and holds her to her chest allura holds  her and you hear kima quietly sobbing for a moment and she goes i well it seems that  things have moved a bit quicker in your absence i think its time to find what we have at our  disposal and do what we can to finish this before it comes on us  laura did you receive any word back from the armies  matt theyre 
none	 about a day south of emon syngorn has returned mikael is leading them northward i  havent checked in im sorry i wanted i should have let you know i couldnt i didnt  marisha allura im sorry we should have been those allies here by your side and we werent  and im sorry  matt it seems you found what you went for lets hope it makes the difference  marisha yes it seems it already has  laura thats true  taliesin we have something else wheres the body  sam what body  taliesin we can 
none	 interrogate him  laura xanthas  travis oh yeah we can  marisha i believe hes still on the wall  laura get that fucker  taliesin just because hes dead doesnt mean he doesnt have to talk to us now  travis ill go get him ill go get him i go up and find the corpse of shitbag and bring it back  matt at which point kima pushes away from allura her head still down she sniffles back  tears looks up punches her in the shoulder allura bumps back and rubs her shoulder i know  
none	 you know kima turns around and walks out of the room in a little bit of a huff her lower lip  quivering allura now smiles for the first time since you came in all right if you can do your thing  ashley okay  travis should i put him on the ground or just hold him ill hold him up  matt so you bring back dragging this bloody body leaving this trail through the fort theres  bits of rock and rubble around and youre like oops drag him over them as you go  travis whoops 
none	 sorry ooh thats pouring out  matt all right so that is a 3rdlevel spell  ashley because of the necklace i have one 3rdlevel spell left because ive used three  matt okay so this would be the one if you had it prepared it has to be prepared all righty  great  sam what are we asking this guy  travis how many questions do we get  laura we get three questions  sam what are we asking  matt can ask the corpse up to five questions  laura why are you such a dick 
none	  marisha you were always mean to us why  travis youve been working with thordak what are his weaknesses  marisha what did he want  taliesin the defenses of the city  matt just be aware of the rule too the corpse is under no compulsion to offer a truthful answer  if you are hostile to it and it recognizes you as an enemy  ashley so maybe just face it towards me  laura yeah cause youre nice  matt you can also discern lies if you get a high enough insight this is still this 
none	 isnt free  answers this is still an interrogation  travis what if we put a bag over his head  laura i dont know  sam who would he trust  liam lizardskinned man  laura oh yeah could you make yourself look like a lizardman  sam yeah sure or i could make someone who we know talk  liam but youre so good with words  sam no but i mean im saying who would he trust i can make that person and i can make that  person talk  matt well technically its pike asking 
none	 the questions since it is her spell so whatever  questions you ask have to go through her  marisha we have the hat of disguise can you give her the hat of disguise  travis what if you made yourself one of the lizardpeople and then you had her down and you  were using her to get info for thordak  taliesin i think hell know that hes dead  marisha you think he wont care  matt yeah  taliesin so the trickery i think it may be i would say its probably either an appeal or 
none	 a  threat  laura lets try the appeal  sam lets build a game show set hell think hes on a japanese game show  laughter  marisha wipeout  laura lets try to make him like us  ashley lets try to make him like us like we were a friend were sad that he died  laura yeah well all back out of view especially me  ashley god okay  sam do we know anything about his family because we could always play bad cop too and threaten  his family  matt you guys have 
none	 not engaged him beyond a brief fuckyoutype conversation in and out  taliesin i can threaten him i can threaten him i will threaten him if necessary but we can try  the carrot before the stick  sam all right so what are we asking what are his weaknesses has thordak had a visit from  greenie raishan  taliesin how did they find out where we were  travis are there secret entrances into emon  laura yeah thats a good one  taliesin what are the strengths of their army what are their weaknesses  marisha what 
none	 does thordak ultimately want  laura who does thordak trust the most  taliesin who in the city especially  laura yeah who in the city does thordak trust  liam do we want to ask him what he knows about the clasps activity  sam were up to 20 questions now  laura four weve got four  taliesin also other questions may lead to other questions  laura okay so thats good lets start with this and then well see where it goes  matt all right what are you doing casting the spell  ashley yeah  
none	 matt all right so as grog throws it on the ground skids for a second you begin casting the  spell as youre casting it kima walks up and kicks it one more time and then walks away you  finish it takes you its a very quick action but as you finish you watch as the air itself  seems to form this mist around the corpse and the mist absorbs into the body all of a sudden the  jaw opens air fills its chest and the head leans up the eyes still staring off into the distance 
none	  but it seems to be addressing you pike  ashley okay so im going to walk over to him and im going to put my hand on his face and im  going to say my friend i am so sorry that youve fallen in battle but i had to bring you back to  ask you some questions i just got so nervous  laughter  liam wheres the beef  ashley so we know that youve been working with thordak and i have some questions has thordak had  a visit from raishan  matt make a 
none	 persuasion check  sam quietly persuasion check  ashley 22  matt the head creaks a little bit as it tilts upward you can hear the unnatural puppeteering of  the body trying to speak not the spirit but the bodys memory hes had no visits he speaks  through his crystals  marisha okay we knew that  taliesin quietly how did they find out where we were how did he find fort daxio  marisha well he speaks to his crystals  taliesin but we dont know like  marisha well some dickhead ratted us out  taliesin 
none	 who  ashley i just have a couple or four more questions for you  laughter  ashley and then i will let you go in peace how did you know that we were at fort daxio  matt naught but two days before maybe less a scouting party left emon saw activity at the  fort and when they checked they saw you and you were marked  travis can you insight check a dead person  laura yeah can we insight check him  matt sure  marisha vox machina im assuming considering you left our  matt 
none	 you get the sense that might be what hes referring to and you get the sense that long ago  when you guys were high up on the broom looking out towards emon you missed seeing something that  was possibly  laura i remember that we didnt roll high enough on perception i rolled a 24 on insight  matt okay so far none of the questions seem to be probing too deeply and he seems to be on the  level with pike  ashley do you know of any secret entrances into emon  matt secrets just 
none	 the traverse junction  sam traverse junction weve heard of that before  marisha yeah we have  matt thats where he used to work thats the  travis the teleportation circle  matt or the tunnels beneath but those are where the clasp reign dominion  travis two more  taliesin who within the city still fights who within the city still fights against the dragon  who will be our allies who can we trust  laura thats a whole lot who within the city fights against thordak  ashley are we looking for allies like who doesnt 
none	  sam well we want to know who thordak trusts and we want to know who thordak doesnt  laura weve only got two questions left  taliesin thordak doesnt trust anybody  marisha well the clasp is clearly working for him now  laura what  laura and taliesin no  marisha well he said the tunnels the clasp reigns dominion so  taliesin thats where they thats theirs  liam but they might still be resisting i mean the question asking this shithead who still  resists within the city will answer a lot of questions  laura 
none	 yeah yeah yeah yeah ask that  ashley who still in the city resists i have one job i feel so  laughter  liam can you understand a word coming out of my mouth  ashley computer who still in the city resists thordak  matt there are a few groups but beneath the city the resistance builds weve tried to smoke  them out but they keep moving  laura whispers so the clasp is still resisting  liam could be  laura can i insight check him  matt sure  laura 18  matt kind of 
none	 hard to read for a dead body but seems to be legit  laura on the up and up  ashley we have one more question but is there anything else  sam anything else allies  laura like who does thordak trust the most  taliesin or what does thordak fear  travis yeah yeah i like that one  liam probably probably what about greyskull keep because there was a tunnel from greyskull  keep into the city  taliesin and ashley he might not know about that  ashley is there anything or anyone that thordak fears 
none	 the most  matt thordak has no fear thordak rules all  liam and travis insight check  travis one  laughter  liam two  laura wait wait wait  matt you cant all make insight checks to cover for the last person failing  taliesin four  laura no but ive been insight checking the whole damn time  matt i know i know  liam but i get plus two so its actually four matt so spill his secrets  laura 25  matt 25 seems to be telling the truth from what he knows you get 
none	 the sense that in a strange way  while he was an intelligent fellow he was also kind of a sniveling patsy and the way that kimas  talked off the cuff since this began to happen since you began to prepare for the corpse she  seems to have a history or at least her and allura both have a history with him in the city  and he was basically a spineless coward  marisha well i mean it makes sense to a certain point when you have a big enough ego you  dont have any more 
none	 fears i guess  liam are we done with him  laura thats it  sam i dont think hes going to talk anymore we should kill him  matt the spell at this point has subsided and the last bit of energy and mist that had entered the  body slowly drifts out of the open mouth and nose gasps and the corpse goes cold  liam you guys can fill me in in a bit and i grab his collar and drag him outside with the rest  of the bodies and start overseeing the burning of the 
none	 bodies  matt okay and there are large pyres for a lot of the lizardmen corpses and wyvern pieces theyve  all been thrown all the rest of the dead soldiers have been rounded up and have blankets and cloth  whatevers nearby to haul them over the wall and begin to recount who fell among them  laura gasps can i fly up in the air and see if i can spot the boys  taliesin we have the stone you can find the boys with the stone if you would like to use the stone  to pick 
none	 up the boys  marisha here i give the stone to vex  matt okay you concentrate on the stone for a minute your form begins to shift your  physicality begins to almost liquefy and then swirls and vanishes from view you open your eyes  and youre in shadow youre in shade youre in this little nook at the side of the rock crevasse  and you hear two voices go surprised gasp and you look immediately to your left and you see  hunin and kyor are both there one of them has dropped the crystal on 
none	 the ground  laura dont drop it  matt sorry sorry  laura no no thats okay  matt it started glowing and i got scared  laura i put it in my pocket im just so glad youre safe  matt im glad youre safe too is everything okay  laura everything is wonderful do you want to come back to the fort all the bad guys are dead  matt they both look at each other okay and hunin takes kyor by the hand and they both walk  after you as you make your way back towards 
none	 fort daxio  laura okay  matt the rest of you  laura i bamf trinket out and let them ride on trinket  matt okay they both climb up after an awkward five minutes of trying to convince them that its  okay trinket nudges them a little bit and they get up on top  laura hes got a taste for the celestial blood  matt theyre both riding on top of him and hes proudly walking bear grunts  laura yeah  travis babysitter trinket  taliesin i say we sleep here for the evening we also 
none	 can go through whatever materials the  invading army left behind cannibalize them for our own i suppose we can eat  marisha i talk to allura i guess  matt okay  marisha is she there  matt yeah shes nearby she was helping gather the dead and she was talking with general elle  and getting the ideas of what the next course of action is and as you approach her she turns to you  and as she recognizes your approach and goes looking to probably make a jaunt to whitestone  shortly and see what weve 
none	 gathered on that end i can bring everyone with me if youd like you can  stay here if you like but  sam we should not leave them again  marisha i would feel terrible leaving everyone again after we gathered everyone who cast that  spell on you feeblemind thats very high level magic  matt it is and it was beyond the capability of that man but he pulled out a small wooden  trinket in front of me which shattered and sent me into my stupor  marisha it was xanthas  matt yes  sam 
none	 and laura he had that wand that shattered  marisha ah  sam did anyone escape the fight to go report back to home  laura there were a couple wyverns that got away thats why i dont know if it whatever  sam so does the plan stay the same  travis i mean we can come back and stage here but we cant leave anybody here  laura say that again  travis we can stage here but we cant leave anybody here  taliesin no we cant leave anybody here but its interesting if were lucky hes 
none	 going to  send more troops to attack and we can be long gone by then  marisha be long gone what happened to using this as our base  laura they know about it  travis we can stage here we can rally here we cant leave anybody here now  taliesin we cant leave anybody here we either abandon or we rally at this point and now that we  know there are forces underneath emon that is good news that is very good news  marisha was it only the wyverns and the lizardmen that attacked  
none	 matt initially it seemed to be some sort of a shock force apparently that fire giant was their  reinforcements or a general i know not from what youve told me at the very least there werent  any powerful entities here at the get go either i dont think it was sent as a fullscale assault  more than it was at this stage just enough to harry and see what was here  marisha who was in contact with xanthras xanthras xanthas xanthas who was in contact  with xanthas  travis oh my lord  sam zenith 
none	  marisha zenith who was in contact with xena the warrior princess  matt xanthas none of us were in contact with him i hadnt seen him probably in the better  part of a year  marisha then how did he know  taliesin they saw us  sam they said the scouts spotted us  laura yeah they spotted us with scouts  travis you had your hood up its okay  liam what of the elves did i hear correctly that syngorn has sent forces  matt as far as i know and the information i have 
none	 received from syngorn theyve taken the rest of  the troops under general mikael daxio as well as the forces of syngorn and theyre marching towards  emon one day out  liam one day out  laura groans oh my god  taliesin we could meet them at emon  sam wait what  taliesin theyre marching towards emon  sam no wait what  laura yeah so theyre a day away  sam is that true  matt theyre making their way northward towards daxio  sam yeah to us  marisha oh to daxio  matt theyre 
none	 a day out from emon but they have to its in the pathway  sam thats fine  taliesin we want them here  marisha thats not okay  sam well where else are we gonna meet  marisha well if they have to go through the battleground  sam they dont have to go through they can go around it theyre not idiots  matt they will and in doing so its about a fourday journey on foot for those troops to make  it here to fort daxio  laura okay so we have four days  taliesin 
none	 we dont have four days  travis i would volunteer that we should head south and meet them where they are  sam on the outskirts of emon  travis yep better than being here cause we let people get away  marisha were sitting ducks here  sam so were gonna march all the troops out of here  laura all the troops which is like 20 people left  travis you gotta reposition once you give your position away  matt as you as that elle pulls forward her helmet under her arm last count looks like we 
none	  have 55 strong surviving  travis yeah were gonna march all 55  marisha out of 200 that were here  sam remember that the original plan was for thordak to know where we were and  send raishan to kill us  marisha where the fuck is raishan where is raishan  laura well we sent raishan back to whitestone with asum and then we left so for all we know  raishans there  marisha allura you were talking about going to whitestone  matt that was my plan yes  marisha and what were all of 
none	 your goals again  sam all of your goals  marisha all of alluras goals  marisha what did you want to do in whitestone  matt thats a very broad question  sam we need to meet up with raishan we need to find a rally point  ashley open a magic cafe  taliesin 55 men in a broken citadel is not a plan it was a plan before its not a plan now  these things have to change  liam weve an army close to emon we do have to talk to raishan though i think 
none	 we should go to  whitestone immediately talk to her and figure out if theres any news with her  sam she was coming back there right  travis yeah is that where she is  laura potentially  liam but be ready to move to the army from syngorn quickly it might be our best shot our  only shot  sam should we march these 55 blokes to the south while we go to whitestone ill stay and march the  troops while you guys go back to whitestone  laura no we need to rest  marisha 
none	 okay hang on hang on what time of day is it  matt at this point its probably a little later afternoon youre maybe an hour hour and a half  from sunset  marisha all right we can gather our most elite  laura it started really strong  marisha i can get a decent amount of people through if we teleport via plants very quickly  but not all of them  laura no  sam i think the 55 will be okay if we send them off into the wilderness  marisha heres the thing 55 people 
none	 walking near emon is not very covert and its clear that there  are scouts everywhere fort daxio was off the map until we showed up no one was watching it until  we showed up  liam but we are out of time  marisha but we are what thordak is watching  taliesin so we have to be very careful of where we go and what we do  marisha we put everyone at risk no matter where we are  sam no matter what theres not gonna be another attack on daxio in the next 24 hours 
none	 so we can go  back to whitestone we can spend the night here and then go back or go back now and spend a night  and then bamf right back before theres any attack  taliesin or we can send half the troops as many as we can tonight stay here and in the morning  send the rest and we can go with them  marisha to where syngorns army is  laura but were gonna have to bring those guys back out here right i mean were gonna have to  march with the 55 guys 
none	 so why send them through to whitestone why not sleep tonight deep within  the fort wake up in the morning  liam they rest up we go  sam to whitestone get info come back tomorrow if we need to  laura yeah but we need to rest now  travis you cant get 55 guys in the mansion right  sam the mansion sure  liam but the mansion cant travel  sam unless we spend the night here first before going to whitestone bright and early in the morning  laura well maybe we should do that 
none	  sam we need to rest anyway im at nine hit points  laura can you use the mansion tonight  sam no i cant  laura so we sleep within the fort deep within the fort  sam yeah  marisha whats left of the fort whats undestroyed  matt the forts actually holding pretty well other than the front doors which need to be  repaired and right now there isnt anything beyond just putting things in the way because of  the impact of the giant the outer walls taken quite a bit of damage but the 
none	 fortress itself  for the most part is standing  sam well be okay for eight hours of sleep and then we can go to whitestone ask around come  back if we need to lets go to sleep  marisha maybe we should have someone on watch  taliesin well it is a fort  laura well put the guards on watch  taliesin they have a system  matt general elle says i can do that dont worry and dont make fun of my horns  laura im not im not im just saying thats the sound theyll 
none	 make if they come  matt its a very specific sound my soldiers are trained to hear  ashley of course if you need us you do blow that horn  matt of course  ashley cause we will hear it  matt yes you will  taliesin i need to sleep  laura lets find a bedroom and lay the fuck down  marisha are we sleeping in the fort  ashley is there a room with a big fireplace in it and we can all just have a sleepover  matt if you want to there is a 
none	 hearth in one of the commonroom areas  laura is there somewhere to clean up  matt they do there are a few bathrooms that can be  ashley are there hides and things like fluffies we can lay on  matt theres nothing terribly comfortable but there are blankets it does get cold this far  north its not in the winter months anymore but just south of the cliffkeep mountains in this  area it does get kinda chilly so there are blankets there are hides there are things to  keep warm in  liam i mean 
none	 you just got used as a weapon you might want a shower  ashley ah i like the dirt  laura im gonna go soak  marisha im gonna crash as soon as i find something fluffy to fall on  matt okay all right the rest of you guys find yourselves to rest for the evening okay those  who care to you clean up and find rest as well the food is meager but serviceable and you all  find yourselves an evenings rest unperturbed a good nine ten hours pass of intense sleep as you  all 
none	 are sore you are all exhausted although you do recover your point of exhaustion scanlan  thats gone as do you from your frenzied rage you all come to consciousness shortly after  daybreak id say you got to bed probably right around sunset or a little bit past sunset so  its just starting to get the sun over the mountains the day is yours  liam well we said what we were gonna do were gonna go to whitestone  laura then lets fucking go to whitestone yep thats what we said we were gonna do  liam 
none	 kiki set us up  marisha sure  sam we have any trees here  marisha yeah  matt allura raises her hand i can still take us there  laura fuck yeah thats right  matt that was the plan but i mean its up to you we could find a tree i suppose  laura okay but i have two extra guys with us right now  matt oh i cannot do that unfortunately  marisha okay you know what i can get us there and allura can get us back on the same day  laura okay 
none	 yeah  marisha what are we getting at whitestone  liam were gonna talk to raishan  laura see if raishans there  marisha is raishan there  laura potentially  matt i havent seen raishan weve been at the fort this entire time waiting for your return  marisha and she was getting asum you know what yeah lets go all right  matt all right you find your way out to one of the slightly charred trees in the main courtyard  area you open the portal whoosh as it opens your two celestialblooded children guide you  
none	 through as well as kima and allura into whitestone you emerge from the sun tree in the  morning hours there as well the city is quiet you can see that a lot of the guard has been  gathering arms and armor just in case they were ever called to be part of this fray and the city  just seems to be on high alert but everything is intact whitestone appears to be fine and the  castle looms northward from your current position you guys make your way towards whitestone castle  the guards greet you and 
none	 lead you inside within minutes cassandra has been summoned down and  says percival thank god youve returned  taliesin thank god all right why whats happened  matt youre alive thats  taliesin oh yes  matt look the last time you left you did not come back in the best of places im just  beginning to think  taliesin i just assume that everything is going to be bad news for the next just assume that im  going to assume everything is terrible every time i see you for the next two months yes were alive 
none	  matt speaking of asum  taliesin oh no  matt come  laura oh cassandra are there rooms for these new guests  matt who are these  laura theyre the sweetest this is um keurig and human  laughter  matt youre the best foster mom ever  laura i have them written down somewhere but i cant find it in my notes  liam we met them at booty theyre totally celestial  marisha theyre totally great man  sam pumpkin latte  marisha they can just crash on our couch for a few months  matt 
none	 you watch their noses scrunch a little as you entirely butcher their names  liam they have like angel blood  laughter  laura what are their names again i cant find it  matt hunin and kyor  laura hunin and kyor  matt yes kyor  liam do you see all of this  laura got it angel babies writing it down  matt yes we can find them a room thats fine not to worry  taliesin well put them to work they will be useful  matt fine  sam i mean not right away theyve 
none	 been slaves why dont we give them a day off  ashley how old are they  matt theyre in their late teens mid to late teens  sam why dont we just give them some schooling  laura i guess theyre about the same age as cassandra then huh  matt cassandras a little bit older though she doesnt act it she acts like fifteen years her  senior and always has  taliesin yes all right asum  matt all right you guys head upstairs with her she leads you oh no she does not lead you  
none	 upstairs she leads you downstairs through the tunnels towards the ziggurat and as shes  walking along she says well weve managed to relocate the meeting room and it required a bit  of careful discussion as to our current allies as well the transport was a bit awkward for asum and  his companion and the dragon cannot maintain her usual form around the ziggurat so just be ready  taliesin i assumed  matt as you guys make your way into the ziggurat chamber you can see already theres the platform  on the outside of the central 
none	 area where the new situation is set and you see theres a table and  you can already hear discussion off that way and there are a few servants that are bringing food  and drinks up there as part of the morning breakfast for those who are in their meeting and  you see there right on the outskirts of the table wrapped and curled up a gargantuan green  dragon with its head resting on its claws that is listening in on part of the conversation  laura oh damn  liam hey little guy  taliesin well 
none	 things have not been going well on our end how about yours  matt to cassandra  taliesin well to the room  matt to the room okay so as you head up to the platform everyone pauses and looks over asum  stands up you can see now this being the real asum acidscarred across the face just as  raishans form arriving was and sitting on the opposite end of raishan and you can see theres  this very much kind of especially as a master of spies and information understands the importance  of you know strange 
none	 bedfellows given the circumstances in war but is still not at ease and  doesnt seem to keep always has one eye on the dragon at all times but gives a nod its good  to see that youre all alive and we have much to discuss please come sit youve met brom  before and you look over and you can see brom goldhand the same squarejawed shorter black  unkempt hair the cleric of ioun that was and is part of the council however the skin is covered  in burn scars like the face some of the 
none	 features are kind of missing all the exposed  elements beyond the armor are just burned but he stands and bows to everyone it is good to see  you all alive he sits down at the table cassandra takes a seat raishan has said nothing  is just watching you all as you sit down gives a nod allura flanks behind you kima has been asked  not to attend chuckles allura sits down on theres a few stools whatever chairs were  available were brought in here so its a ramshackle meeting room given how many butts have 
none	  to sit around this area  laura ill stand  matt but you are all here so ive been told that you were at daxio and gathering other allies  about please let us know what the circumstance is from your end of things things are not as well  from ours  travis that sucks to hear  taliesin daxio was discovered and attacked prematurely  matt wonderful  taliesin a group has already a small strike group came and attacked the fort did damage i  wouldnt necessarily call it significant damage  laura but wiped out 
none	 a large percentage of the force there  taliesin decimated it  travis 75 percent  liam grog  travis i mean whatever those words mean  laughter  taliesin broken clock thats a very good guess grog ive completely lost my train of thought  travis approximately  marisha the problem is that weve summoned many of our allies to fort daxio and they are currently  in transit to that current location  matt but daxios been attacked  marisha correct  matt then i would not recommend taking folks to fort daxio especially if its sustained damage 
none	  well weve been busy in emon the eyes glance over at raishan and well needless to say  things have gone a bit strange weve been working with spireling shenn and the clasp and weve been  able to smuggle thousands of denizens of emon beneath the city those that were not directly  enslaved or gave fealty to the cinder king out of fear and other interests weve been able to keep  safe and weve moved through the tunnels as often as possible there are still many many many  wyvern riders that patrol the city the 
town	 townfolk have run out of offerings and are now being sent  out in slave groups to pull goods from nearby cities to bring at the feet of the dragon we also  have a rising volcanic mass rising up beneath the city that has consumed a number of the underground  clasp tunnels and has been slowly pinching off our mobility beneath the town so our intent to  hopefully find some sort of retort or vengeance and eventually take down the dragon that clock  is definitely ticking now weve been keeping as best an eye on thordak 
none	 as we can brom bless him  and his sacrifices has been our front man for this and we know the creature has been shedding  scales in places where jets of everburning flame now spark and burn the city itself wherever each  one of these scales falls it seems to be a beacon or source of its own whitehot fire so the city  is now a pitfall of its own right the creature itself the dragon it has these jets that now  burst from underneath its armor fire that licks beyond it it has a crest 
none	 of red crystals now that  begin to twist behind its horns and head its eyes are like whitehot stars from the sky its  its still dragonlike but something more primal and elemental sighs im not entirely certain  what were dealing with here but brom youve made some headway and brom clears his throat  ahem myself and a few devout have been doing our best to prepare surviving warriors and guards  and mages who were ousted from the lyceum we have a few strike teams that have been effective in  harrying the outside of his 
none	 defenses learning information we can knocking down the guardians  since the fire giants have arrived its been a little more difficult so weve been reduced to  stealth missions quick in and out we dont have the muscle to assault headon up until recently  his eyes pass over to you you say there are armies making their way to the city and we have  you all the strength that youve gained and the stories ive heard from people here at whitestone  if were going to do something we need to do it soon now the lyceum 
town	 has fallen to those that  have sworn fealty to the cinder king so we dont have use of those artifacts anymore weve been  trying to break through to the inner sanctum of the cloudtop what the dragon now calls its home  its lair its burrowed this deep underground basin where it resides now it only emerges when  summoned or called to or when it decides to make a proclamation drawing what little bit of  children or families that it sees as a fun bit of play to watch them bow and quiver in the street 
none	  before asking for someone to prove their strength and their worship of himself and strike them where  they stand some days hes angry some days hes laughing this dragon is completely insane we  cant really gauge red dragons are known for pride and you could count on that use it against  them but sometimes his jaws quiver as he cries and shakes and yells out laughing into the sky a  terrible laughter one that can induce the worst of nightmares i dont know what were dealing  with anymore however we did have one team 
none	 a very brave team that provoked the dragon to leave  its lair and held it long enough for us to move past it and pierce the inside of its sanctum now  we passed the wards and the pools of fire the beast returned before we could get too far and i  lost most of my men myself barely surviving with my life and the scars to tell of it but the  beast is building something in that lair something it is guarding fiercely and something  that it will not leave something that i think it 
none	 has come to hold more dear than the city it now  presides over if there is a key to piercing its pride or if there is a reason to take it down i  begin to fear what its holding below the city now by the might of the wounded mistress of  knowledge ioun in the channels in which we speak that is all the information i have i hope  its helped in some way and he sits down in his chair and clutches his holy symbol  laura oh my god  taliesin this changes much 
none	  marisha yes it does  liam dragon youre awfully quiet we need to act what do you advise  matt raishans head slowly turns towards you and the nostrils kind of snort not in an  aggressive way but in acknowledgement the bright yellowish eyes you can see the blackened veins  that curl up past the scales some of the scales actually splitting and pulling open what you can  see would be some sort of a contagionbased wound that while not infected does not look positive  raishans lips curl up and the voice billows forth a 
none	 low curling growl well if the madness  continues to spread and our recent conversations confirm this youve gathered your allies  distraction attack confusion chaos striking towards the center of the city is the best chance  we have if we have a way in to break the cloudtop we can battle it there draw it from its  lair force it to possibly rescind within and have our final battle there or if luck is with  us finish it on the streets itself and discover whatever it is its keeping while it lies dead and  burning 
town	 in the street  liam you say we  laura youll fight alongside us  matt what have i to gain by watching you do this yourself  marisha i imagine whatever hes building what is he building do you know  matt i have no idea he lets nothing within his sanctum  marisha insight check  matt make an insight check  travis come on high insight  marisha what was that thats okay 23  matt 23  sam gasps whispers the promo link is lootcratecomcriticalrole promo code  criticalrole for ten percent off your first month 
none	 and remember youre doing this to support the  show and to support my kids preschool class and the memory of dennis  laura and coachella  liam coachella needs capoeira classes  laughter  taliesin we should also probably tell them about xanthas that we did have  sam tell who about xanthas  taliesin the room  sam oh well there was a guy named xanthas we killed him he was a dick whats there to tell  taliesin there is worth telling is that he had already turned and was working  for the cinder king  
none	 sam keyleth  taliesin and he is now no longer with us  laura brom do you know osysa the sphinx  matt thinks for a minute i do not know of this sphinx i am sorry  laura theres a temple to ioun in vasselheim  matt there is a temple to ioun in vasselheim  laura there is  matt that is good many temples have fallen and hidden through the years since our  mistress was wounded  laura you would have no way of contacting it  matt i can beseech my mistress for information but 
none	 short of travelling to vasselheim which i have  not been to i cannot help you i apologise since the calamity during the struggle with tharizdun  my mistress was grievously wounded in the struggle and since then has been diminished and  in this time many of those that seek to lessen her hold on the world and the spread of the  information and knowledge that we wish to share have then hunted and persecuted those of us that  follow in her wake so the temples have been buried or kept in distributed information through  anonymous 
none	 channels only a few of us in positions of protection can speak out so strongly this  surprisingly he turns back towards the ziggurat this was one such temple  marisha what  laura yeah thats right this was a temple to ioun we knew that  marisha right right okay so wait tharizdun  matt tharizdun the chained oblivion  marisha is that another god  matt yes a very evil one sealed chained away nothing you need to worry about not in  the midst of this  taliesin were going to have to go to emon  
none	 laura well yeah  sam sure well rally all the troops outside and maybe go in through the tunnels i guess when we  rally the troops we can form a more specific plan  taliesin there will be several armies we will have allies there will be troops to create  distractions there will be troops that go into the tunnels there will probably be a group of  troops that go in to try and pierce the lair we will create chaos  sam ooh did the airship ever show up  matt cassandra says yes the airship 
none	 has been told to make its way towards fort daxio  sam oh thats good oh wait well you know  taliesin it could actually pick up the people there  sam sure yeah  travis do we want to do a last trip to vasselheim to talk to osysa or since we got all the vestiges  sam to do what its not all the vestiges in the world  laura no all the ones she told us about  travis she was like if you get these then  i will help you  sam oh really she 
none	 said that  laura did she say that  travis did she say that  marisha did she say that  laura do we remember her saying anything like that  matt well you didnt learn about the vestiges until it was  laura it was from her hubby her boyfriend  matt yeah kamaljiori it was yeah  travis yeah that name  laura the one that said a name is earned  matt yes  laura do we need to go to him  travis its a sphinx  laura was there anybody that said they would help 
none	 us once we got all the vestiges i feel like they  said that once we got all the vestiges wed be like extra awesome  sam we are extra awesome  laura well yeah yeah yeah  marisha i mean theres some i feel like theres not some sort of voltron thing considering  there are more vestiges in the world  travis you lack imagination  sam quick lets try to fit all of our vestiges together right now  laura okay lets do it  sam i just stab at pike  laura ow ow ow ow 
none	  ashley i dont feel anything  travis does anything happen when theyre all touching  laughter  matt you take all the vestiges and and smush them into a pile on the central table and all the rest  of the council kind of  laura oh its not magic down here  matt look curiously and they all gather around as you begin to place them all into the central  area kind of overlapping in almost the shape of a person who is built of vestiges you put them each  one down their kind of magical 
none	 essence clinging with the surface of the stone table  laura theres no magic down here  liam i just lie down across the entire table  matt all right the sound of them impacting they all sit there on the table  liam they dont stick to my armor somehow  matt no  travis you gotta say a word  matt everyones kind of standing there watching quietly as nothing happens and then asum goes  all right then um  sam maybe you should put your armor back on pike  ashley i mean i have underclothes 
none	  sam okay  matt yeah we had that discussion you need things beneath the armor or itll cut you to shit  ashley just like bareback armor  matt thatd be a bad idea youd get pinched in all the wrong places  taliesin we do have well we do have our own tunnel into the city that we can show is anybody  using our tunnels into the city  sam the clasp oh you mean our specifically last time i scryed there there was someone in the keep  laura can you scry there now  sam 
none	 no  marisha wait werent they  laura oh yeah keyleth can you scry not down here we have to leave the ziggurat  marisha ive got the scrying eye  taliesin if the keep is clear that does give us access possibly clear access  laura we could bamf into the keep  sam yeah that just gets us inside the wall that doesnt thats it  liam thats not nothing  sam the sewers is where we need to be  liam it connects thatll get us under the wall what about what about cashew what about shaun 
none	  what about zahra  marisha cashews kinda mad at us  liam yeah im sure he is but this the end of times  matt cassandra kind of raises her hand and goes kashaw and zahra they are ready to go whenever  you are ready  laura sweet  liam shaun  matt shaun weve  were trying to decide if it is best to keep someone here to maintain the  barrier or if we are going all in on this if we just send everyone out there  and leave the city defenseless  sam i 
none	 think its best to leave him here especially since that was his plan all along  because he is a dominator of all worlds and a god among men  matt allura raises her hand and goes either i or shaun can run the barrier you can decide i  dont mind staying back or going to the forefront its your choice which one of us to take  travis can gilmore transport people like you can  matt i believe he can yes  travis i like gilmore  liam for what for keeping him alive or taking him 
none	  travis no bringing him with dude he turned that guy into a little pretzel dough ball just because  he fucked with him  marisha but allura can teleport us back and forth  travis yeah so can he  marisha can he  travis thats what he just said  taliesin allura signed up for this fight  liam yeah allura what do you want to do  matt its interesting i have a lot of personal history with thordak i feel a deep sense of  responsibility for all of this that still eats away at me 
dung	 and because of that a part of me  really longs to be there with all of you putting this dark and fiery chapter to rest on the other  hand having already faced him and having an inkling of what he is now every part of me wants  to run away screaming  liam but you have faced him  matt i have  liam and thats invaluable  matt i lost many good people in doing so  taliesin and were going to lose many more  matt most likely so the choice is yours vox machina 
none	  travis gilmore  laughing  travis no offense youre lovely and very strong  matt you watch her audibly sighs  laura is that relief that was relief  matt its both its a lot of things its an emotionally conflicted exhale but it is a relief  of tension regardless  liam i disagree you fought this fucking thing before you know him that is invaluable you have  more experience than we do youre wiser than us  marisha scanlan what do you think  sam i think we should decide this the way we always do 
none	  liam coin toss  sam talk about it for a long long time  laughter  matt thats dd man  sam lets put it to a vote  liam experience experience  sam a voice vote all in favor of gilmore say hell yeah all in favor of allura say ah  sure sure right  sam gilmore  sam ashley travis hell yeah  sam oh just us allura  sam taliesin liam marisha ah sure  laughter  travis but that was three and three whatd you vote  ashley i voted gilmore  travis thats 
none	 four  liam i dont know what would happen so gilmore gilmore  travis four and three  taliesin gilmore doesnt want to go either  ashley neither of them want to go but shes so scared now  marisha allura hang on wait im talking to her im not voting im talking to her  laughter  sam allura i vote for gilmore  laughter  taliesin unless gilmore feels like volunteering  marisha allura i have had destiny pushed upon me since birth what do you feel is right because  im not sure what to believe anymore 
none	  laura make this decision for us  marisha make this decision for us  sam hey lets leave it to the dice  matt allura turns to you kind of takes the side of your head in her hands and says and in  becoming a leader youve been put in a position to make very difficult choices as you grow as a  leader youll have to make many more this is not my choice to make  marisha but in many ways youve been our leader  laughter  sam we already voted people and gilmore won 
none	  taliesin no actually allura won  matt who do you choose  travis yeah its four to three  liam well then its covered then its done  matt keyleth  taliesin all right  liam unless you do what laura and marisha did and do the exact opposite after the vote right come  on allura  marisha wait are you trying to use this as an allegory  liam no thats just a throwback to what episode  matt at this point raishan picks up and goes  marisha oh clarota  matt oh god at the

none	 cassandra  stands up holds her collar and its interesting in moments like these that such a young girl still  carries the weight of a room like this of such giants by comparison to her and still can command  attention so quickly with a subtle physicality and then she adjusts her collar a bit and raises  her chin and so it is vox machina we gather our forces put your minds together decide on  your plan of action your means of attack soon we begin the assault on emon  and thats where well end our
