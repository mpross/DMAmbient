none	 to whitestone get on getting on  marisha im coming boo  matt as you focus and touch the outside of the tree you watch as this small familiar portal  begins to tear its way through the outer bark of the nearby trunk from there as you reach through  the magic creating this portal between you and whitestone you hear the voice echo in the  distance i hear you and thus the temporary doorway between here and whitestone is open the  rest of you guys rush through with kima and pike in tow you make your 
town	 way into whitestone itself  at this point in time it looks like its fairly late in the afternoon its still day here thats  a day eight hours there actually no it would be pretty early morning by here at this point you  step out and the sky is starting to come to light you see the blue slowly transitioning into a light  orange to a yellow as the sunrise is making its way over the mountain range that surrounds the  outside of whitestone youre met with a few wandering guards that wander through the town 
town	 that  acknowledge your presence but it is your call as to what you wish to do now  sam does the town look like its safe and intact  matt it seems like it hasnt suffered any sort of incursion or attack yeah  sam okay yeah thats good  marisha weve only been gone for what 24 hours  laura no like two days because we slept there  taliesin about two days  marisha im going to go check and see if i can find kash  taliesin also going to head towards the castle and we 
none	 should drop off some of our spoils  laura our loot  travis where where do we drop them off at  laura the castle  taliesin i would imagine the treasury room is where it can be  matt there is a treasury vault in the whitestone castle  travis oh cool yeah totally knew about that place  matt all right pike says shes going to go and check in with the temple and make sure everything  there is taken care of and situated kima leaves with you guys towards the whitestone castle as  you make 
none	 your way up you get to the very outside of the castle at the time the sunrise finally  breaks the mountain range and you see the sun coming in what little bit of mist begins to  slowly burn off of the surrounding forested area the cold brisk morning air is immediately met  with that warm ray of sun hitting you and its welcoming both to be returning to a place of  comfort but also the transition into day itself is a very warm and welcoming experience as you step  towards the front there are four 
none	 guards at the front gate they step aside to let you in as you  step into the main foyer of the area you already see a familiar sight you see there waiting arms  crossed leaning against the wall seeker asum  laura scars still on the face  matt yeah still acidpocked scar across the right side ruining the tattooed face the rest of  the castle seems relatively quiet at this time as it is very early  marisha shes the only one hes the only one there  matt within the actual foyer of the castle 
none	 yes the main entrance area as you guys begin to step  inside seeker asum steps in your direction steps in your direction and kima is already taking a  brisk walk in that direction and goes pointing outward toward seeker asum now  marisha i grab kima by the wrist not right now maybe  matt now you told me youd already met with a creature this is the at which point seeker  asums hands rest on to kimas shoulder kimas head whips around to face asum and asum says  you need not worry  sam hes 
none	 going to try a thing on her  laura she hates that  sam she doesnt like it  marisha oh no  taliesin hes going to the sheets  matt kimas eyes blink for a moment and she  marisha no no no no no no i still have my hands on kima right  matt yeah  marisha i counter with a 6thlevel dispel magic can i do that  matt you can certainly try  marisha fuck  matt all right so as you begin to  laura oh no were going to start a fight thats 
none	 going to start a fight  marisha i dont want her to fucking cast any shit on kima  travis what if it was just a chill out spell  marisha its probably a charm spell or a memory spell no i dont want to fucking wait  matt its not a counterspell but you can try to cast it on her to see if it has any effect  marisha okay  matt all righty so the dc of the spell okay so as you pull back and begin chanting to  yourself clutching kima and pulling her away 
dung	 from asum asums grip leaves kimas shoulder and kimas  still shaking her head groggily you finish the dispel magic and you feel the strange warm pulse  of energy radiate briefly out from kimas body kima turns to look at you and goes what why  would im sorry i went groggy there for a second weve had a long day good to see you  asum and asum nods and says well the pleasure is mine glad to see you all made it back safe and sound  sam yes we did thank you asum  matt we

none	 deep breath as the sun rays hit and looks over his shoulder smiles and  continues to walk down the path in towards whitestone itself  sam we can kill him right here right now  marisha groans  travis no no coughs  matt kima takes a couple steps and says wow im more tired than i expected after that fight  then again we did kill a dragon and that is fantastic  travis we did yeah and you got a brilliant new sword  matt which she pulls out and swish you can see the arc of 
none	 light streak across the blade as she  flings it in the air with incredible strength for a halfling of her size shes still marveled by  it you know what im not going to sleep im going to go practice and she goes and runs off  down one of the hallways towards one of the castles training rooms  travis wait kima kima you dont hear anything when you use that do you like voices or someone  talking to you or  matt she holds the blade up to her ear no  travis no good good 
none	 its a beginner problem but youre quite advanced not worried about it  enjoy  matt thanks grog slaps you on the shoulder with an awkward glance and continues the  excited steps forward into vanishing somewhere into the castle  travis the sword is clean  laura good job  travis yeah dodged a bullet on that one  laura we should put that hide in the treasury  travis hide  laura the 140 pounds of dragonhide youre carrying right now  travis oh right im dragging it behind me  laura yeah  travis yeah right

none	 moment  travis singing be prepared  taliesin dont think about it dont plan dont have any thoughts in your head  laura improvise were good at that  taliesin you cant lie about anything do not lie to her about anything and one of the ways we can  lie best is by truthfully saying we have no plans against her right now because we have no plans  against her right now the more we talk the more she will be able to perceive our deceptions if we  have any be very careful this is going to 
none	 be very dangerous theres going to be a lot of  improvisation  laura i hate knowing that shes going to be able to hear all of our plans  marisha sighs  taliesin honestly we should have assumed that they could hear all of our plans from the  beginning  laura yes  taliesin sighs my fault really well we are very good at being spied on  sam yes well we like to talk  taliesin and even if we do even if we were to get rid of her theres no sense in believing that

none	 the door and you can see shes getting herself prepared for the  meeting as you enter the room the door partially ajar you see her still down currently thumbing  through notes her hair is still in disarray and pulled back haphazardly and shes wearing her  morning gown and without even looking up goes percival glad youve arrived and still in one piece  taliesin yes and down one dragon  matt i have to tell you im very impressed  taliesin thank you two more to go its going to get a little heavier at this point 
none	  matt indeed thats what our meeting is about  iphone what was that again  taliesin what was that again  matt sorry i need to go fire some of my guards theyre making a nuisance continue please  taliesin two more to go i fear that its possible that whitestone itself may eventually be  a target of an attack i feel it may be inevitable  matt that is actually what our meeting is about prevent that from happening  taliesin quickly to check i would know what languages cassandra spoke correct  matt what languages do 
dung	 you know  taliesin elven celestial common  matt she knows elven and common she does not know celestial  taliesin okay  matt that was more your hobby  taliesin i figured that was my guess i wanted to confirm  matt yeah  taliesin i hand her a small slip of paper that i have written in elven be prepared for anything  today keep silent  matt she gives you a very keen look and you can see cassandra as much as she is the healthiest  youve seen her physically her eyes have dark circles over 
none	 them it looks like shes been very  harried by the events of these past few weeks understandably so but she takes and looks over  the sheet and goes well very well should be an interesting meeting then  taliesin i think so  i do think so its good to see you taking command  matt its good to see you and i look forward to  you sharing some of the burden soon  taliesin yes  matt right  taliesin quite possibly  matt right  taliesin we will discuss whence the  dragons are taken 
none	 care of  matt good  taliesin we will discuss at the very least relieving you of some of this  burden  matt good  taliesin i know it is not fair  matt whatever is fair in this life the wonders of lordship and ladydom  sam im going to run off and try to find jarett  matt okay do you wish to come anything  else you want to bring to this conversation  taliesin no im fine with that my last thing is im going to quickly run and have a quick conversation  privately 
none	 with i assume we have some sort of royal jeweler of some kind or somebody who does some of  the ornamental work  matt no one who lives on site per se but there are two individuals that your family  generally used for various forms of jewel craft  taliesin im going to write and send a letter off for that  matt okay no worries scanlan what are you  going to do looking for jarett  sam looking for jarett  matt okay you head outside of the main  castle down to where the  
none	 training barracks are for whitestone and you can see jaretts already out there with a small  metallic platter on his lap scarfing up some food real fast hes gotten his day started relatively  early and as soon as you approach mouths already full mmm scanlan its good to see you  sam good to see you too whatre you enjoying there  matt laughs the usual gruel that you find in this city  sam oh i thought it might be something  meatbased that you could have popped  up a bit with your spice  matt 
none	 oh well trust me ive used it on  the eggs and it makes it  bearable whitestone is not well known for its cuisine from what i can tell everythings gray  and lacks flavor  sam ill invite you over to my house some  time give you a proper chicken dinner  matt all right i will happily take you up on that offer thank you  sam wanted to check in on lowers voice the task we talked about  matt the task  sam you know the mission we discussed  matt remind me again 
none	  sam i dont want to talk about it out in the open but you know there was some illicit  matt oh  sam items of medicine  matt yes i sent a request through someone i know  sam sent a request youre using other people i trust you i dont trust other people  matt im not going to leave the city right now to go find look i have two  people i know that might be able to get what you need but its going to take time  sam sighs i dont have time 
none	 sighs  matt when did you pick up this habit im worried about you now scanlan  sam i havent picked it up im trying to pick it up damn it its the most difficult  habit to pick up listen can i confide in you man to man one on one here  matt certainly  sam youre a fighter youre a strapping young battle man arent you  matt chuckles i have been told this once or twice yes  sam i havent felt myself recently you know we have these fights and some of them are  
none	 pretty epic and theres monsters involved and im usually on my game but lately im feeling a  little off how do you cope with that  matt well largely by not using illicit substances  sam dont judge dont judge  matt im not judging im worried about you like if you dont even have a habit why  would you look for this the scanlan i knew the one that hired me  he knew how to deal with this issue  he got laid  sam i dont really do that much anymore  matt maybe thats 
none	 why youre not feeling up to the task laughs  sam that is a very fair point jarett  matt im just saying look and i do not  mean to talk out of turn he  sets his meal aside but you are a man who walks driven by his pelvis am i wrong  sam youre not wrong  matt then what happens if the pelvis goes unused grows bashful  travis preach  sam like a fine instrument it can go untuned if you leave a fine violin without  playing it for many years it could 
none	 wither and rot until you need to replace some of the parts in a  way the same is true for my member but the problem here jarett is that im distracted im  distracted by things that havent ever distracted me before ive made a promise to someone to stay  alive ive never valued my own life before and when we get into the shit im secondguessing  things im making stupid decisions that i wouldnt have otherwise made  matt because suddenly you have purpose because you have a reason to come back  sam yes  
none	 matt thats not a bad thing then  sam i dont know how to harness that kind of stress  matt do you have a keepsake of this reason to return this person you made a promise to  sam do i have a keepsake i dont think so  matt then you need to get yourself a keepsake  sam well shes not around right now to get a keepsake from  matt then something else that reminds you of her something that you can look at in that  moment when youre not so sure  sam how 
tavern	 did you get so wise jarett  matt drink a lot listen to people talk there are none wiser than barkeeps my friend and i  have been friends with many a barkeep  sam these are all good suggestions but im a man of instinct and my instincts said i need to  supplement my body with some extra liquid courage so if you can please continue to look for me  matt i will continue searching and providing what you require  sam ive heard that it can help people in moments of panic and stress  matt 
none	 and ive watched it ruin lives near ktawl swamp  sam i can handle a lot of things  matt you are a strange gnome  sam takes one to know one  matt does not work in this circumstance but i applaud your attempt it was good ill do what i  can but dont forget you have more than one reason to stick around  sam i know thats what worries me ill think about what you said maybe ill go have a toss  see if that helps too  matt here tell you what come here 
none	  sam yes  matt and he suckerpunches you in the face you unexpectedly fall back you feel the pulsing of  the blood run to your cheek your eyesight goes white for a second he goes see now you have to  live to return the favor  sam you that was clever i will definitely get you back  matt good i look forward to it  sam watch your back  matt i always do  sam get me some drugs  matt awesome grog  travis its daytime right  matt yeah its early morning  
none	 travis is there a way i can find a courtyard or an openair area  matt there are a couple of courtyards within the perimeter walls of the castle they have some  small garden elements  travis if i get there are there a lot of guards keeping an eye  matt not within the courtyard no occasionally therell be one patrolling  travis can i pee in the courtyard  matt by all means  travis i feel like i need to mark my territory this is home for us and i peed all over greyskull  keep 
none	 i left little puddles that yall didnt know about its real important in case other goliaths  come around and are like sniff nope the wolfs here i got to go elsewhere  taliesin i assumed it was shoddy masonry and everything was leaking  travis no stealth roll motherfucker can i take a leak on a wall in the courtyard  matt yeah and there are a number of walls to choose from varying heights different levels of  masonry you have the veritable pick of the litter  travis can i find the highest wall with the most 
none	 ornate decoration on it and go slightly off left  the way me member goes and make a little box right there a little waterfall on the whitestone  matt certainly you find the portion where the exterior wall has one little parapetjoining  portion with the exterior of the castle itself there you can see the masonry is fine the stones  themselves are cleancut and joined properly there isnt a whole lot in the way of ornate  craftsmanship on the exterior of the castle or the walls but you feel as far as your interest  grog 
none	 this is a good wall  travis very nice  matt you mark your territory expertly  travis in a wide arcing pattern not like the one shot like a nice upsidedown crown  matt there you go like a cylon eyebeam yeah totally you do so with gusto congratulations  travis thank you home  matt thats how grog spells home  marisha stellar rp  travis how else do you spell home  matt unless theres anything else that needs to be done  liam im not done with my errands can i go find kynan  matt

none	 finishes his meal scarfs up the last bit of egg  on the side of the plate hey  liam jarett  matt yes  liam hey i dont want to interrupt kynan the new guy is he around  matt probably inside sleeping or waking  liam okay if i go in  matt sure this way  liam just be a minute  matt sure go for it he sits back down you head inside the doors not locked you open it  you see ten different individuals that are all in the process of waking up you 
none	 can smell coffee  very basic breakfast meats being cooked some of them are around tables talking hunched forward  and laughing as soon as you walk in a few of them turn and look at you some dont recognize  you some do you see in the far corner sitting alone at one of the tables is kynan who is  prisonstyle guarding his food and eating by himself  liam right towards him hey  matt hello  liam how are you fitting in  matt all right everyone heres been fine  liam you hanging back

none	 now see a few other  guys in the room and the rooms got a little bit quieter theyre all watching whats happening  whats going on he notices the attention and ill take good care of him  liam i believe you  matt i mean no offense its a lot of attention right now  liam i give a slap on his cheek remember everything i said all right  matt yeah i will  liam youre a good kid whack  matt soft chuckle same temple  liam ill see you later all right  matt yeah 
none	 definitely and you head out okay at this point in time a number of pages have been  sent throughout the city to gather those whove been wandering about whitestone as you are being  called to the meeting in the second floor war room held within the castle itself  marisha second floor  matt same one where you met with  marisha asum thatll do all right  taliesin be ready for anything  travis lets go krogering the best of everything  marisha before we walk in i grab grog how do you do it  travis 
none	 do what  marisha youre able to utilize your rage when necessary how do you keep it suppressed when its  not needed  travis ah well good question  marisha please enlighten me professor grog  travis right it all comes down to one word really clears throat family right before i  was a part of this group i had no family pike took me in i met all of you and i had a purpose  so before that i would be down to fuck anything up anytime no problem i still kind of am but i 
none	  realized that if i fly off the handle too soon it screws over my family thats no good because i  care about you most of you  laughter  travis youre going to get yours its coming and im going to help you and im going to high  five you when its done but until then you keep that shit tucked inside let it build and then  when the time is right you let her have it and ill throw you into the fray when the time is right  marisha promise  travis yeah i 
none	 promise  marisha deal  travis deal  cracking noise  laughter  marisha ow ow grog grog  travis oh shit sorry im so sorry  marisha no its fine i appreciate it its good  travis oh yeah bruises right  liam she should really take one hit point of damage  laughter  matt sure you take a hit point of damage  marisha oh man people are going to ask questions about that later  travis no its cool you make up a really good story  marisha sure yeah  travis but listen if at 
none	 any time it gets to be too much you just go weve got you  marisha okay i dont want to let you guys down  travis you wont  marisha thanks grog okay clears throat lets do this  matt all right you guys enter the war room same as it was previously left however you are  brought the image of the table in early morning allura gilmore surprisingly drake thunderbrand  cassandra as well as asum whos standing behind most of them back to the window they all middle  of conversation turn and smile as you 
none	 begin to walk in you see gilmore nods to everybody gives  an extra smile to you vax cassandras waiting for the pleasantries to end allura comes up and  takes your hand and she goes its wonderful to see that youve returned safely ive had many  terrible thoughts that perhaps this meeting would not be as positive and im very glad to know that  i was wrong and that you brought kima back to us as well pike is safe as well so congratulations  i guess are in order come sit these circumstances do press our 
none	 timeline a bit and  you see there are a number of other chairs already brought into the room prepared for you guys to  sit around together  marisha is there anyone sitting next to raishan  matt no actually  marisha i sit next to raishan  matt raishan is not sitting raishan is standing with her arms crossed leaning against the  window  laura i want to stay standing as well  marisha yeah i move closer to raishan  matt okay as you approach you see asums eyes watch you small grin on the face 
none	 and a little nod  marisha i give a nod back  taliesin i pull a chair out for asum and im going to offer him the chair and sit and pull one  out extra for myself  matt at which point cassandra gathers all of your attention in the midst of this chaos the  excursion to wildemount went well as far as i understand you are now one more dragonslaying  into this chaotic endeavor well done tell me how did this happen  taliesin a deal was made with the locals we brought the dragon to 
none	 an appointed kill spot  outside of the city we summoned a creature  laura with the gate scroll that we showed you actually  taliesin there was a battle and we felled it that was more or less how it went down it was a  simple trap it was elegant and we barely survived  marisha i pull out the spire of conflux and hand it to her we retrieved this in our spoils you  may recognize it as one of the vestiges that we spoke of earlier  matt cassandra takes it and says it looks 
none	 quite important allura  marisha yes i thought i was handing it to allura  laughter  marisha sorry it was meant for allura  matt i can see how this would be confusing  marisha yes  sam you look just like allura right now  laura allura is everything okay have you been through some shit allura  matt its been a rough week  laughter  matt i almost did allura too next halloween  liam vax is leaning against the door to this chamber by the way  matt all right allura takes it inspects it 
none	 this is a magnificent artifact well found  perhaps well take a look at it after the meeting together  marisha sure  matt cassandra gets everyones attention once more motions to the guards the door that youre  leaning by gets closed as the guards step out so its only you guys having this conversation so  with another of the conclave fallen retaliation is imminent and with thordak already infuriated  at the death of umbrasyl and we only caught but a glance of that anger thankfully through the means  of which allura and gilmore and others 
none	 were able to cloak the city i do not feel that will last  the entirety of the time we would need to take a leisurely stroll through our next series of plans  i fear that less protected cities may be in the path of retaliation before it finds its way to  us allura speaks up at this point and goes thordak is a creature of infinite pride and a  slight such as this against the conclave will most likely trigger the destruction of even more  innocents both to satiate his anger and im certain to 
none	 also draw us out he is an intelligent  one as is the company he keeps ive also reached out to other members of the arcana pansophical  and hope that they would come to our aid but given the recent death of vorugal i do not know  if theyll arrive in time to be of any assistance so we have to begin to gather our strengths our  allies and honestly i think we need to strike first  travis you do  matt well otherwise we wait for the fight to be on thordaks turf  travis 
none	 thats unexpected  laura just pop on over to emon then  matt well we need a plan first we need to gather those weve called to arms we need to  assess what strengths we have and utilizing all of these things at our disposal come up with an  idea of how were actually going to do this gilmore steps in and goes if we are to strike i  agree it should also be very soon weve pushed the boundaries of being on his peripheral even  this long and you say that he knows your faces 
none	 correct  taliesin yes  matt his gaze will now surely fall upon the seven of you at the very least  taliesin it was inevitable  matt asum steps forward at this point from the wall and begins to walk in front of you keyleth  and between percy the longer he remains as well the more the landscape of emon and the surrounding  bladeshimmer shoreline begins to churn begins to boil with flame and toxic fume he is scarring the  surrounding land with his claws his teeth his flames his roar and those that follow in 
none	 his  shadow his fearmongering has risen a number under him a creature of such pride is eager to show that if  you fall in such fear and do as he says there are rewards im sure youve come across many  weakwilled individuals in your travels that would be eager to jump at the chance of working beneath  such a powerful and dangerous creature  allura steps in at this point now and says now i believe it is partially his essence but the  expedited rate of this elemental transition around him is based on the 
none	 soul anchor that we embedded  within him to keep him in the fire elemental plane this stone that resides in the center of  his chest and belly i believe this stone is somehow drawing elements of the essence of the  fire elemental plane itself into emon i mean its not unusual for the presence of a red dragon  over hundreds of years to begin to convert the scenery around but this speed i can only see a  connection between the enchantment that we hoped would hold thordak at bay and the changes were  seeing 
none	 at the center of emon and beyond now it was never intended for him to leave that place  and i feel deeply responsible for many elements of the danger we now see in this world i only know  that i will do whatever it takes on my end to see that this comes to an end whatever sacrifice  whatever is necessary im at your disposal but the responsibility of the destruction is also our  own the longer we take the more chance he will tear through kymal he will tear through westruun  he will tear 
none	 through daxio he will begin to burn everything that taldorei is until we show our faces  liam i am curious what the master of secrets thinks asum  matt asum is still walking a circle around the table  liam what do you propose we do  matt hmph well before we get to that let us discuss things we have at our disposal the  information we have and from that we can garnish a plan i am the master of secrets i am not a master  of warmongering and attack  taliesin i get up i 
none	 walk to the window and i look out the window were not going to be safe  here for much longer that much is certain we will need to move quickly  matt drake speaks up for the first time and goes aye not to mention that slippery green drake is  still out there somewhere and we have no idea where it is two members of the conclave are  remaining  travis well ow right yeah two  taliesin do you think perhaps its best to skip one and hope for the element of surprise maybe he  
none	 thinks were going to finish off his generals before we come to him it may be a brief moment  of surprise if anything maybe hes expecting us to kill one more not go for the main prize  liam cut off the head of the king  taliesin maybe  sam thordak from what i understand is extremely powerful and influential that raishan dragon is a  mere pittance in comparison a small exponential ant a pawn if you will on the battlefield  matt i certainly hope so and if thats the case then i think youre right 
none	 go for the king  first but we must do so with eyes all about us because the last thing we need is to be flanked by  that beast in the center of our attack  marisha exactly we dont want to deal with two ancient dragons  taliesin can we lure it somewhere else perhaps  matt if we knew where it fucking was allura speaks up at this point and goes look i know  that thordaks hate for me still burns hence the reason why they went directly for my tower when  they first arrived 
none	 in emon the one trump card we do have in this is me  laura do you want to offer yourself as bait  matt if need be im not saying thats the right plan but im saying it is one thing we can  perhaps utilize in our plan in our strategy  travis is his hate for you  taliesin i think there was a ship in draconia a northern ship of some kind i  still feel there may be some sort of weapon inside it that may prove useful it was a ship that had been 
none	  dragged there by the white dragon its been bothering me and then of course we have whatever  it is we have downstairs im not saying we should use it but it is powerful  laura i dont know how we would use it  travis we cant move it can we  laura we cant touch it  matt gilmore pops up again and says exactly we were poring over that thing for a number of  weeks until we had to build this barrier and to be perfectly honest i am sick of it  liam youve 
none	 got nothing  matt well we understand its a siphon its bringing the energy of the nexus somewhere we  dont know where the other end of it is or if its even functioning properly  marisha allura do you still feel a connection with the soul stone thats inside of thordak  matt well i have no personal connection to it i know that i was the architect of its enchantment  and the ruse of which sealed it within thordak  marisha you built it you must know of some way to disable it  travis or a 
none	 weakness  marisha yeah  matt we designed it to have no weakness the intent was to keep him there indefinitely perhaps  if we could  marisha what  matt asum you said you have friends back in emon still that have been gathering intel asum  turns yes actually and i was hoping that as part of our plan today we could even go and  retrieve some of this information perhaps that could teach us more about this soul anchor you  continuously talk about  sam how can we retrieve this information without going to emon 
none	  matt oh we would have to go to emon  sam that sounds crazy is there any way to not do that  matt perhaps ill go alone  marisha the soul stone has been broken and abused before i have a feeling theres someone who might  have an idea on how to disable it  travis i really dont i have no idea  marisha well raishan was the one who busted out thordak in the first place out of the fire plane  so i would assume that raishan has some idea on how to  
none	 travis oh  laura you think i feel like raishan would only know how to open up a portal  marisha well i have a lot of feelings about raishan  matt cassandra speaks up and says well youve been abroad youve been gaining arms and allies  from what youve told me from across exandria let us consolidate our options our strengths and  plop it down in front of the conclave best we can  sam im no master strategist but we do have allies that we can call upon and weapons and men  and arms and 
none	 troops however taking the fight to thordak in emon seems foolhardy at best i suppose  this is where the intelligence could come into play is there some other place where we could go  and try to take back from thordak to lure him away from emon  matt asum steps into the conversation and goes the thing with that plan is thordak has amassed  thousands of lizardfolk in emon at this point that follow his whim in the nearby mountain ranges  many from the stormcrest that worshipped him the entire time that he was gone wyvern 
none	 riders  originally aided in taking the city that you met as did i but since other allies have found their  way to the cinder kings sway last that i checked it seemed that there were a number of  allies that he brought over from his time in the fire plane as well  laura what  matt fire giants in the service of the dragon now walk the streets  sam so if we go into emon were facing fire giants lizard people and thats before we get to  thordak the cinder king  laura how 
town	 the fuck are we going to fight him  matt thats what were discussing today  sam does thordak covet any other territory or city or town vasselheim here anywhere that we  can lure him to  travis anything he has nostalgic feelings about glintshore  liam anything that would piss him off  matt you were lucky to draw a creature of such infinitesimal experience and intelligence as a  white dragon away from its home roost i would be greatly surprised if you had pulled a great  powerful intelligent ancient red dragon from its home turf 
none	 advantage  liam so your prediction is that we have to slog our way through the outskirts of emon to fight him  on his home turf is that about the size of it  matt thats one way  sam whats another  matt distract his allies and go straight for the heart you have allies like allura just said all  throughout the world  travis this is true we have the herd we can go get the werewolves  sam the ravenites would help  marisha everyone who we ask everyone who we send in there were 
town	 sending in to their death  taliesin this is war  travis yeah but its either death now or death a little later  laura were sending ourselves as well  liam so are we talking about sending everyone we know and everything we have to the outskirts of town  sam for a full frontal attack while we bamf into the dragons lair  liam yeah we create a massive fucking clusterfuck on the edge of his periphery and we go  for the center  laura how long did it take you allura to create that heart  
none	 matt well the design and the development and enchantment of it are powerful enough to anchor  itself to the soul of a dragon of thordaks strength better part of six months  liam and laura six months  liam weve probably got a week or two  matt and that was with a dozen other hands helping me most of the arcana pansophical was at  my side for that and we dont have that kind of time  liam well we take a day or two and we amass every heavy fucking hitter we have and we do 
none	 this what  other choice do we have  marisha i keep thinking back to emon where we watched half of our friends die in a second  liam a lot of us are going to die  matt cassandra sits up a little bit in her seat and goes if we are smart about this we can  minimize the casualties far more now than they would be a week two weeks a month a year from now  travis i agree  taliesin what of whitestone we put the city at great risk how much risk are we 
none	 willing to take  liam percy everywhere is at great risk right now  marisha its true  travis we should leave whitestone  sam but even getting to emon arent we exposing ourselves to detection and attack  travis we are if we wait  sam were going to march several armies across the entire continent to get there itll take days  laura how do we get armies there  liam were going to take a day or two were going to figure out how to get who we have to  where we need were not doing 
town	 this tomorrow in a couple of days three days four days at the most  its not ideal but its what we have to do  sam we can at least move people to you know wheres that town that was established  travis outside of westruun  matt theres westruun kymal were the two that you moved  sam westruun is closeish right to emon  matt westruuns a little bit further than kymal is kymal is where you sent a lot of the westruun  refugees  travis right  laura but theyre just townsfolk  sam but 
none	 we can at least assemble there from all the different territories and then meet up form  a plan and then march from there  laura march on emon if we gather our forces thordak will notice  travis yeah weve got to do a lot of recon before then but i think hes got a good point  right weve got to have like a staging point  matt cassandra turns looks over to asum and goes recon actually anything else asum you  may have in regards to what we can expect there asum is still slowly walking 
none	 around the peripheral  of the meeting table i can tell you that most of the citys wealth and resources as well as  caches sealed arcane relics and weaponry long held by the lyceum or the arms of emon have been  stolen and thrown atop the victory hoard of thordak most who are part of this rebellion  within the city are doing so with scraps that is why the clasp has been so instrumental in the  removal of many of the oppressed folk within the city also the fire that marks thordaks presence  that have 
none	 drawn fire and molten rock across the city as well as the outskirts of the city walls  scar the landscape and fill the sky with sulfurous clouds and black smoke the good news is that  smoke can be utilized should someone have some control over the elements to be a screen  however where the cloudtop district once stood there is now but a heated cauldron of glowing  stone and flame hundreds of gifts and statues left in thordaks image litter the outer area  while a massive cavern dives beneath the central region of the district 
none	 now this cavern as weve  watched it we believe it to be the location of thordaks treasure vault as well as the  occasional sleeping place of the massive drake we speak of thordak is also showing rather intense  signs of physical change since being released from his prison and his size still remains enormous by  comparison his eyes now burn with a searing white light burning stars in the sky his jaw ever  dribbles with burning liquid that blackens the ground it touches the gaps between scales appear  to flare bright with each breath 
none	 like a star engine beneath the scales  marisha sneezes sorry  laura bless you  marisha yeah sorry  laura do you think its overtaking him  matt ive no idea allura and allura goes well if the anchor was indeed removed from the  fire elemental plane then thordak would have had his soul torn from his body that is how the  anchor worked  marisha so you dont think he actually even fully separated from the plane he brought the plane  with him  matt or at least maybe a piece i wasnt there i 
none	 dont know the ritual that brought him over  marisha maybe then were looking at this the wrong way maybe we go at this through the fire  plane maybe theres something still there  taliesin a way to sever his connection to the fire plane maybe  marisha yeah  matt allura thinks for a second  marisha weve got an easy door in  matt i could try but the enchantment itself we dont have enough information it wasnt bound  to a specific place in the plane it was bound to the plane itself i dont know 
none	 how youd sever it  from the other side  travis from the other side wed have to go there  sam yeah  travis thats called thinking outside the circle  sam but then once were there what do we do  marisha and we dont even know where to look i mean we could at least talk to the ashari there  they might  taliesin another ally  travis is there like nothing friendly in the fire plane  liam its at least as big as taldorei i mean its another dimension  laura its huge  
none	 marisha its huge but not many people know the whereabouts theres still locations and  destinations within the fire plane its navigable  laura maybe all the evil things in the fire plane are gone right now and theyre with thordak  matt asum steps forward to the table and puts his little halfling hands on the edge and goes  well its a shame that we dont have any information about this ritual that freed him from  the plane  laura that is a shame a real shame  matt ill see if my compatriots can gather information 
none	 but in the meantime well do the best  we can to gather similar information  liam well we know we dont have a lot of time but do we maybe want to table this and think on it  sam at the very least should we send out some letters alerting our allies that  laura shits going down  sam its time to start stocking up and getting ready to move  matt drake steps forward and goes i think thats a fine plan of action reach out to all  those you brought in hopefully we can 
none	 get a few of our friends in this as well  laura did an airship ever arrive  matt they all look at each other a bit confused no  laura an airship did anyone see an airship flying around  matt i didnt see one and cassandra goes no there hasnt been an airship here no are we  expecting one  laura mmhmm  matt good to know  sam the city is invisible  matt yes so they wont see us if they come if we see an airship do you wish us to flag it down 
none	  laura that would be good  matt you trust it  laura yes  liam they are a rarity  matt all right  sam maybe come up with a landing point as well  matt now  sam well soon  taliesin we have one other possible option in front of us show them the medal  sam no thank you  taliesin youre not going to show them the medal not that no no not that please dont whip that  out no one wants to see that  sam no not the cube  taliesin we 
none	 have another ally that we have spoken of  sam its a tenuous ally at best maybe we shouldnt discuss it until were 100 sure about it  liam yeah thats a big maybe thats a big maybe yeah  marisha yeah theyre very busy though  laura yeah its really far away and then as we were leaving the people that we talked to about it  matt its fine i get it reach out to your people on one end  taliesin i slowly walk around the table thinking hard about it  and i stab seeker asum 
none	 three times in the back with my sword  marisha lets fucking do this shit lets do it lets do it  laura but we need to know the ritual  liam its too late he did it  marisha yelling yeah  sam oh percy no  matt go ahead and roll  taliesin thats a surprise attack  matt i know it is  sam oh god why were in crazy costumes  liam check out the brain on brad  laura weve got allura and gilmore and drake  taliesin we have a lot of people in 
none	 the room  sam oh god  matt go ahead and roll roll the first attack with advantage  travis were in a room  laura whitestones about to be destroyed  sam and raishans about to leave  liam oh man hes not making you roll stealth motherfucker  laura why would he he doesnt  liam because i would and hotis did on me  laura thats different  liam no its not  taliesin thats 29  matt okay as you pull the blade out of the hilt to go ahead and begin to strike youre a 
none	 quick  individual youre also in the presence of an entity that does not trust anyone or anything you  take the blade and swing out in the direction of seeker asum and where your blade strikes it  shimmers through the image theres a flash and asum is suddenly four feet away from the position  where asum was standing at which point everyone in the room stands up immediately and is like  whoa whoa cassandra goes over and puts her hand towards you and asum is taking a few steps back  and is like breathes heavily 
none	  taliesin no tricks in here no tricks in here if were really going to do this  matt theres this moment of extreme quiet tension as alluras looking at you looking at  asum looking around and theres like this slow connecting moment of realization throughout the  room as everyones eyes go wide  taliesin if were really going to do this no tricks in here  matt and with that were going to take a break  screaming  marisha amazing  laura taliesin  taliesin dont trust a man who just kissed somebody thats a man 
none	 whos saying fuck it  liam backpedal backpedal backpedal  marisha im into it im really into it  liam yes we know darling we know  matt all righty well well go ahead and take a short break here guys well be back here in a  few minutes and well victor voice see what happens next normal voice all right see you  guys here in a minute  break  matt welcome back everyone to critical role when we last left off clarota over here let us  all marvel at that  cheering  taliesin it 
none	 was me all along  laura oh god are you going to leave that on the whole time  taliesin oh hell no i cant see or hear a thing  marisha it was so shortlived  liam three seconds of costume thats all you get  laughter  sam you cant put just this part on  taliesin no its really uncomfortable  laura just the helmet  liam do the frigging helmet i had my arm behind my back for two hours  taliesin why would you do that  liam commitment  marisha i have so many 
none	 guns in my belt no one can even see them and im still committed  sam i painted my entire body  taliesin what is wrong with you people  laura thats good youre good now  taliesin i cant really claim sanity i just did something mindbendingly stupid  liam you now look like one of your own bullets  laughter  matt you have a very merlin from excalibur thing going on there right now  taliesin a dream to some a nightmare to others  laughter  taliesin oh like lightning yes  matt we need more 
none	 green lights in here to really get the effect  taliesin go see excalibur not right now but tomorrow  matt all right so bringing it back in as your blade swings through and passes through the form  of seeker asum it shimmers and then darts backward into the corner of the room  taliesin i immediately sheath and say no more tricks if were going to do this we need  everybody to know whats on the table  matt at which point everyone who stood up and held off at the chaos you see all the faces 
none	 going  off in realization asum goes from a defensive position and then stands up again crosses the arms  taliesin were either going to win or were not i was hoping you were going to take care of that  matt were working on that plan as we speak but pardon me if i take a few how do you say  careful backups in case one would take a blade and stab at an ally supposedly  taliesin you know damn well that were not allies you know damn well that this is a tenuous  relationship and 
none	 you know that neither of us trust the other  matt at which point allura puts her hand out and goes im sorry what the hell is going on here  taliesin well get there i would hope that you wouldnt trust us and i would hope that you  understand that we dont trust you but we need to make a real plan now  matt as the tension slowly subsides gilmore puts his finger up pardon my momentary ignorance  would you like me to cleanse the room  taliesin im hoping for a conversation to start that 
none	 i promised i wouldnt start myself i am  trying to keep to the letter of my word  sam it might help if gilmore were to make sure everyone is on the upandup in this room  taliesin seeker asum do you have an opinion on how you would like to proceed  matt seeker asum takes a few steps towards you casually looks up to you and goes to pat you on  the shoulder his illusory hand passing through your form goes im quite comfortable where i am  right now let us continue this conversation  
none	 taliesin the floor is yours if you wish to tell everyone what the real plan is  matt very well since my hand has been forced hello seeker asum is still back in emon dealing  with the difficulty of preparing the current circumstance were discussing i am raishan  member of the conclave up until recently tenuous ally with thordak the cinder king who is now  considered a mutual thorn in all of our sides ive made an agreement with your vox machina for  quite some time together using our combined strengths we slew vorugal the frigid 
none	 doom over  in wildemount weve returned to reconvene ive provided nothing but honest upfront and  necessarily vital information to your victory  taliesin i will confirm everything but for quite some time to the room  laura ive just been staring at allura  matt allura you see her fingers are twitching and her arms tense and theres this very faint  air thats blowing her hair ever so slightly where theres no wind in the air shes on edge  right now and is looking to you guys for guidance like are we doing this  cassandra 
none	 stood up immediately for the first time in a long time since whitestone was reclaimed  cassandra now resembles more her age than she ever did she has a look on her face like shes far out  of her depth understanding the circumstance theres legitimate fear in her face and shes  looking at percival with that look of what have you done  taliesin now we can have a real conversation about whats going on we have an ally on the  inside albeit an untrustworthy one youll pardon that but theres every possibility that this is  
none	 an elaborate trap i respect your intelligence far too much to try and pretend otherwise you  understand certainly what i mean having this on the table we now know that theres every  possibility that the red dragon knows everything theres every possibility that were walking into  a trap or theres every possibility that we have an insatiably powerful ally it is a terrible risk  marisha or an insatiably powerful enemy  taliesin also a terrible risk  laura either way we can now ask about the ritual  marisha why dont you inform the room on 
none	 how you utilized an entire race of people to break the ritual  matt everyones still standing at this point looking cassandra slowly sits down but is still  looking between raishan and percival you watch as asums form steps towards the center of the room  the flash of green flaring in the eyes with a smile the anchor that you speak of was indeed  removed from the fire elemental plane we discovered that it was indestructible good on  you allura well created we tried many different ways rending it crushing it sending it  elsewhere without 
none	 the enchantment tearing thordak with it to no avail in trying to find a way to  bring thordak through we needed to bring the soul anchor and the fire elemental plane with it the  one place where such research could be gathered promptly fully was pyrah now mind you it was  not my intent for such destruction to rain upon them i spent many years with them i got to know  them theyre a fine people in that time i learned the ways of temporal travel between  dimensions the details that allowed me to see 
none	 the fabric of the fire plane to where we could encase  a bit of it within the soul anchor itself once we had managed to crack that essence i was able to  from a distance using the allies at the other end thordak had found friendship with some of the  ousted fire giants they found comfort outside of the ordning under the shadow of the fire dragon  in using their deep richblooded past and forging and making they were able to convert the soul  anchor into something that housed the essence of the fire plane 
none	 however we didnt have a means of  creating a hole large enough to bring both through without destroying both in the process and as  such we waited for the right time the winters crest  marisha you bitch  matt to some maybe but we called this the ember seed the ember seed resides in the center  of this heartstone that is what is causing thordak to swell that is whats driving him mad  that is what is drawing the very land around emon to fiery eruption it is also what keeps his soul  on 
none	 this plane  travis what keeps his soul on this plane  matt it keeps the soul intact with his body  travis destroy the stone  taliesin it cant be destroyed  matt in theory but weve tried believe me weve tried  marisha and you kept the soul and the stone inside of him  matt to remove it would destroy him as well as the arcana pansophical saw fit so yes both came  through waited for the winters crest had enough power and understanding of the ritual to open the  entirety of the tear and 
none	 thordak screamed through flames in his wake and he laid waste  to your people not i  marisha no you used me you used us and my fear that i had originally appears to be true a lot of  this is my fault im willing to accept my onus the fact that you cant shows all the kind of  person that you are my promise still stands im thinking it might come sooner rather than later  matt you do understand that without my aid you will not succeed  marisha i understand that without your aid 
none	 none of this would have fucking happened in the first place  matt yes and there are quite a few in this room that fall in that category she looks to allura  and drake  marisha so it seems all of us can accept our part in this matter except for you  matt i accept my part in this matter as well you dont think i feel duped by this you dont  think i have many things i wish to tear from the very corpse of that entity you think i dont want  to see him 
none	 burn as much as you do this vengeance that burns within me  marisha what would you do if you actually got what you want  matt what all of us want freedom  marisha i pull out the spire of conflux there are always many solutions to many problems you  think thordak is the only solution to yours this staff was birthed from the head of melora the  same goddess who gave you that curse what if you wanted me instead me and this staff maybe i can  help you more than thordak can  matt 
none	 are you saying you understand the way to remove this that you know the secret to burning  this wretched disease from my form  marisha im saying i might be your best chance at salvation im pretty sure this staff is the  closest living relic that we have in existence to the god who granted your curse thordak is no god  that was your first stupid mistake  taliesin i think if i might translate what my friend here is trying to relate is that perhaps  when the dust has settled your salvation may either be 
none	 found in the withering corpse or  cackling smile of a creature that you are subservient to who will take great delight in  your destruction or perhaps in those youve aided who will feel grateful  marisha its up to you raishan  taliesin and i will advise her to take no revenge until all cards are on the table  matt well good  marisha clearly you are the type of person who looks for answers in other people you are clearly  unaware of accepting any fault or any result of your actions why dont you start 
none	 fresh do you  really want thordak to have another sway over you another gift another favor that hes given you  that he is going to hold over you for all of eternity do you really want that youre stronger  than that  matt thats why were working to watch him fall  marisha are we  matt chuckles if you need not my help just let me know  marisha oh no raishan we dont need your help let me say that right now this all depends on  what you want out of the end of 
none	 the deal  matt i wish to be given unfettered unbothered unwatched control over the corpse upon his death  to extract the information i need i will leave your very sphere of existence and understanding  until the end of your days  liam what happens if we say no to that  matt oh then ill find another way  marisha spoiler alert were saying no to that  taliesin unfettered im fine with its unwatched  matt then watch watch for all i care it will be greek to you anyway  marisha shes taken way too 
none	 much she doesnt get to leave  taliesin shes already left  travis yeah i walk over around the table towards asum i try and poke her in the shoulder him  matt it passes through the form  taliesin this is the deal that we are offered this is the deal thats on the table we are in a  tenuous position of power  sam you can stop poking grog  travis shes not here  laura thats crazy  sam give her one more good poke  taliesin how do we get in contact with you when 
none	 we know when we move and how  matt well what is your next step through your journey  taliesin that is the question now that everythings on the table im sorry to shock  everyone i was hoping not to be the cause of it i was hoping that it was time for everything to be  on the table but this is actually what were dealing with this is the complexity this is the  battlefield  travis so we have to rally our forces to us and we have to do some really smart recon do we 
none	 make  her a part of that or no  taliesin no the more distance that we keep the better  sam from her  taliesin yes she will probably be i imagine in our way on occasion  liam but no one make any mistake shes lying to our faces she is not telling us what she wants or  what she wants to do you have a whole plan  matt assume what you will  liam shut the fuck up youve been droning on for an hour shut the fuck up youre not telling us  what 
none	 you want you fucking shit bag fuck you  matt keep great company  liam does anyone really believe that this is all going to be fixed if we work with her  marisha i say we take a recess gather our thoughts raishan my offer still stands if you  want to come and find me i know you know how maybe we can commune with melora together  matt you do not comprehend the magics that you even speak of its cute look i agree distance  is of aid to us at the moment if anything i 
none	 should probably cut off the information of  vorugals fall i should speak with the cinder king and still establish my allegiance from his  perspective  taliesin can you cut off that information i would imagine that would be far too much  matt cut it off no but i can attempt to guide the fury if you will  laura will he know it was us  matt i can guarantee it  travis can you keep him from attacking whitestone  matt for a time maybe  marisha can you guide his fury in a way that 
none	 would be beneficial to the plan  matt if i knew what the plan was yes  marisha you were saying ideally if we could get him away  taliesin i dont think were going to get him away  sam were going to do recon were going to send out word to gather our forces where  taliesin what if he knew where we were  travis we dont know yet  sam lets find out lets pick a place  taliesin what if you knew where we were what if we found a place we pick our battleground 
none	 he  discovers where were hiding  marisha and raishan rats us out  taliesin and raishan discovers this information  marisha would certainly put you in the good graces of the cinder king  matt raishan takes a moment and thinks  taliesin you are searching for us right now are you not  matt i am indeed but thordak has been using us as the attack  liam yeah hes not going to leave his nest  laura so what if we kill you  matt what do you mean  laura how does thordak know youre alive 
none	  matt because i check in every now and then to remind him  laura what if he sends you out and we kill you  marisha and you never come back hed be forced to be the one to have to leave the battlefield  taliesin if he knew where you were headed  marisha youre a clever girl im sure you can make a ruse to make you look convincingly dead  taliesin you wouldnt even have to tell us where you were hiding you could just hide and we could  ready ourselves  matt that is 
dung	 an idea hmm take your recess ill take mine there may be something to this plot  marisha and we can all assume that when we exit this room that our tenuous alliance is still  that correct  matt i would hope that theres no more errant blade pokery  taliesin now that i know your tricks  laura we do it to everyone dont worry  taliesin we actually do now that i think about it  marisha yeah thats kind of true  liam were also not alone here allura how does this sit with you  
none	 matt allura is sitting right now shes listening to everything with her hands crossed shakes her  head and goes to be perfectly honest this bothers me a great deal but the fact that  whitestone still stands does speak volumes at the least  taliesin it does  matt with the cards being in our favor  taliesin its not the first devil ive made a deal with  matt no  laura doesnt always turn out well percival  taliesin doesnt always turn out terribly either  matt regardless i have a lot to think about as do 
none	 we all and allura slowly turns her head and  looks up probably for the first time since she sat down to the illusory raishans asum form  asum lives then indeed he does indeed he does and allura turns her  head back and goes  marisha can i do an insight check  matt go for it  marisha does she know if asum is up to something no good 25 i think better double check that 25  matt 25 okay its hard to read the demeanor of raishan in general its this middle ground of  
none	 neutral expression with a halfcocked grin information flows at this consistent rate of being  generally difficult to read the beat of hesitation is meant for emphasis more than  covering if that makes any sense so it seems to have an honesty to it if you could read any  honesty from raishan  laura raishan now that we know youre you do you have to continue the ruse of being asum or  can you bring him here  matt i can certainly bring him here if youd like however he is doing quite a lot of good 
none	  with the clasp and brom and tofor underneath emon right now and theyve managed to  save many lives and continue to do so  laura maybe you could pop him over then just for a little bit  matt well  laura youre quite powerful  matt what do you have need for asum  laura i want to hear whats going on with the clasp i want to see for myself that hes alive  taliesin were actually going to have to have a conversation with the clasp because were going  to purge the city once 
none	 the dragon is gone  matt why dont you go see him yourself  travis no i like her idea i want to see him here  liam yeah i feel a little better here it would go a long way to earning some trust  matt well make your choice either i intercept and begin to work towards thordaks ruse and set  a space that convinces him perhaps ive fallen into your hands or i go retrieve your friend from  emon im not your errand boy and we have a limited time here which is more important 
none	  travis sure you are you are our errand boy we are your vessel to what it is you want so get  busy and do it quickly after all youre very powerful but that changes day by day doesnt it  matt so emon it is very well back in a day  taliesin we will start figuring out and discussing a place for the final battle we will  find a place that is advantageous your input if you feel the urge to give it is always welcome  at least to me  matt its going to 
none	 be very difficult to pry the cinder king from his nest  taliesin your supposed death will go far for that  matt if anything but i have no guarantees  taliesin as long as everything is on the up and up and as long as we do not catch you in deep  deceit  liam whispers good luck with that  taliesin we will make sure that the plan moves in the direction it is meant to  matt one day then  travis one day  matt and the image disappearing noise  taliesin hes going to 
none	 send asum to us  travis so allura so its clear seeker asum is raishan  taliesin and has been since raishans appearance in whitestone  marisha and we didnt know until 48 hours ago tops  taliesin now can we maybe make sure that everybody in the room is who they say they are  sam go stab everyone percy one at a time  matt as you say that everyone pulls back from the table  laura im a dragon too evil laugh  liam hi larkin  matt there he is  taliesin i apologize i didnt 
none	 know what else to do  laura you thought you were going to stab him  liam yes you did percival  laura that was not a play  travis yeah lets be real about it no tricks in this room  liam yeah you shifted gears very quickly there  laura no tricks  taliesin ive told no lies in this room  liam uhhuh  travis fake cough whiff  taliesin i tell that creature no lies ever that is a green dragon there is no tricking it there  is no deceiving it there is just telling 
none	 as much truth as you can get away with  matt as youre talking you feel a tug on your right arm and you look over and you see  cassandra who has come over to your side and is pulling on your sleeve with a very intense look in  her eye she goes percival i can watch whitestone i can get the people fed i can keep  the people armed i can organize the day to day i cant keep it safe from that  taliesin which is why i would ask everyone to please not antagonize 
none	 it  matt percival percival i dont know what you dragged us into in this but i need you to pull us  out of it i cant do this  taliesin ive moved the battle that is the best that i know how  matt how long have you known  taliesin two days  laura not long cassandra  taliesin two days  sam maybe three  marisha we were forced  taliesin the day before we left to kill the white dragon  sam theres a time difference  laura and if we had told any of 
none	 you your life would have been in danger  taliesin this was the best way i knew to keep her from destroying this city outright this was the  best way that kept her from telling the red dragon where we are and the longer that we can keep her  a tenuous ally the longer whitestone will stand  sam when she does come back with asum this plan that we started in on its a good one  taliesin i think so  sam well we have raishan convince thordak that were amassing forces in kymal or something 
none	  thordak sends raishan to get us we kill raishan  laura mmhmm  sam and then thordak comes to check on our dead bodies  taliesin we send word of a dead dragon  sam how can that plan fail  liam i mean im not the only one who thinks shes more dangerous than he is at this point  laura oh yes i think if we give her access to thordaks body afterwards were asking for a lot  of trouble  taliesin which is why if keyleth can figure out a way to cure her of 
none	 this disease it takes a big  card off the table  liam weve got 24 hours  marisha i have ideas  taliesin we have more than that because its going to take quite a while thats how long we  have to make a plan  laura question what if we do actually just kill her  sam raishan  laura when we fake that were killing her what if we kill her  marisha just actually kill her  taliesin shes going to be expecting that and it will not work  travis and shes super slippery 
none	 she just totally like evaded percys sneak stabbystab  liam is there anyone around right now  matt oh yeah no allura drake  liam 20 natural 20 for perception  matt for perception  liam yeah i said is anyone around and i rolled a 20  matt you guys are still in the war room  liam i know but you know what im talking about you know what im talking about  matt oh  liam there it is its right there invisible fucking larkin dwarf dragon  matt you dont see anybody else around  liam 
none	 all right thats a 20  laura should we continue this conversation downstairs  taliesin first is everybody who they say they are please if you would be so kind  travis oh yeah allura can we light your sage real quick make sure everybodys on the up and up  matt allura sits up and says well i mean it makes sense asum is the one that requested we not  move the war room down to the  taliesin so why dont we move the war room now  matt i think that would be the best yes 
none	 let us all adjourn to the new space at the ziggurat that  should at least keep things honest  travis yeah  matt allura picks her robes up and  sam grog your beard might go away  laura gasps no  travis no its in there  taliesin it just wont grow while hes down there  liam i mean for science right lets go you look really good without a beard grog ive  always thought so  travis you shut up you  laughter  travis we can go down there i dont care  taliesin 
none	 all right  matt okay you guys make your way down to the ziggurat the guards come and start carrying  chairs and other elements of the war room eventually youre all led down through the  tunnels which have been a little more refined and given an actual more comfortable path past the  nowdefunct whitestone refinery that the briarwoods had originally established you enter  the ziggurat room it has more lighting to it than it previously did a number of torches now line  the walls the sconces that are lit as the guards progress upward you 
none	 can see the reflection to the  green glasslike whitestone material that permeates the outside of the ziggurat and not  right by it but partially upward theres a small wooden platform thats been where the main base of  operations for research and study is here you see a number of desks set out its been built  alongside of the large pyramidtype structure and eventually you all adjourn up into that space as  you go up there you all feel a significant drop in enchantment all of your magical items all of  everything gradually fades in 
none	 this space so grog you actually feel your musculature the  titanstone gauntlets themselves the effect begins to completely fade back to your classic  groglike strength  travis i feel totally fine  laura are the walls still like people  matt oh do you want to go to the top of the ziggurat and check  marisha oh  taliesin not yet after the meeting  marisha did they have like a cleanup crew down there  taliesin its a guy on a scaffold with a scrub brush going ew ew  laura theyre really clean naked bodies 
none	 now  liam brush cleaning out the fingernails  matt at this point theyre looking around everyone whos journeyed with you towards this new  meeting place the ziggurat is of the same physicality they were at the meeting room any  illusions that would have been cast aside or dispelled at this point seem to not be present so everyone  is by all intents and purposes who they say they are  sam okay  taliesin and this also means it would probably be impossible to scry in this room  marisha yes  matt allura nods yes 
none	 actually yes  taliesin excellent this is where all talk must happen now  laura where it should have been happening  taliesin so now you know what weve been dealing with for the past 72 hours she did help with the  death of that dragon in fact i doubt we would have survived without her aid she could have very  easily left us there to die  laura its true she actually revealed her entire form during the battle which is quite diseased  taliesin at least it appeared diseased  marisha shes definitely not as strong 
none	 as the others but far more clever  taliesin and she knows where we are and what our plans are and every inch of this place including  this thing  matt well then what do you presume we do  sam we dont really have a choice we have to work with her to some extent we can make it hard  for her and we can be assholes to her and go tell her to get asum for us but other than that  we have to work with her  liam whats the benefit of working with 
none	 her  sam because if we dont she can destroy whitestone whenever she feels like it  liam what if we tell her were going to fake her death and then we kill her for real  sam thats fine if she ever gets close enough for us to kill her  taliesin shes not going to  travis she evaded it really easy  sam why would she need to come face to face with us in that plan ever she could say im going  to go meet them in kymal oh i died  taliesin our best 
none	 bet is maybe hopefully enough of us still have our strength maybe at the end if  she has been ravaged by the red dragon  travis i agree  laura and then we try to defeat her after that  travis i agree our play is the finish line thats it not a moment before  laura but we have to beat her to it if she gets a hold of that stone  marisha its what she wants  laura yes  taliesin our hope is to break the stone  marisha we cant break the stone  
none	 taliesin only because no one has  sam if we draw thordak to us at least we control the battlefield she could still be lying in wait  to pounce on his body the second we kill him  liam if we have to hope that shes actually going to fight with us shes done it once we  dont know that shes going to do it again we dont know  marisha they mentioned moving the stone that shouldnt have been able to have been moved  correct they moved it inside of thordak and then thordak left with 
none	 the stone in him right  taliesin yes which i dont think should have been possible  marisha right so how did they do it because im also looking at another thing that is supposedly  immovable  laura marisha and taliesin supposedly  taliesin oh its possible nothing is impossible  laura are you suggesting we put the vortex of doom inside one of us  marisha kind of yeah thats what i was  matt allura immediately puts her hands up and goes no no no no  marisha theres got to be a way to move it 
none	  sam to do what though  matt this is an absence of magic it is a void of magic it is a maw that devours magic the  enchantment that we put within thordak is pure magic  liam and youve been working on it for months and you are smarter than us  matt well  laura right no way to transport it none at all  marisha it could be the only thing that could break the stone  laura think about it if we could get that stone next to the vortex hed be fucked  
none	 matt right so what we take a few wooden two by fours and push it along look everything i know  everything ive studied everything ive spent my entire life working for is useless near that  laura this is a temple to ioun right  matt it was  laura the goddess of knowledge  sam sure  matt the only person i know of who rightfully worshipped ioun was brom  laura brom  sam of the clasp  matt arbiter brom he was of the council with us  laura and hes in emon potentially  matt 
none	 according to raishan with tofor and  laura broms with asum  matt yes  taliesin what holds it there its a shame we cant open a giant door and push it down here  marisha what did you just say  taliesin we cant do it  marisha what say it again one more time  taliesin its a shame we cant open a giant door and push the dragon in here  sam how on earth could we  taliesin we couldnt do it it wont work because that side of the door wont open by its  
none	 very nature no door can be opened to this room no one can get in or out without someone walking  laura you couldnt have used the gate scroll in here  taliesin im trying to even conceive of a machine that could move this but i dont understand why  its here in the first place  sam i dont think the secret to defeating thordak is moving this thing  taliesin its a shame we couldnt we have a line in the sand of how close we can get to this thing  with magic correct  matt 
none	 this way and she leads you back down the ziggurat out to the entrance where you guys  entered this large chamber and about 20 or so meters back you can see there is a specific  wooden support beam that is structured within this tunnel and on that beam elements of it are  painted black and she goes this is the perimeter in which the siphon devours magic  inward  marisha how big is it how big is it roughly  matt what the  marisha perimeter  matt id say itd take a halfmile  marisha 
none	 damn this place is really big and its encased in stone yeah kind of right were we  encased in whitestone right  taliesin in stone ive got a terrible idea  marisha tell me  taliesin what happens to magical creatures when they enter the circle have we experimented at all  to find out what would happen to a magical creature a creature whose very essence is magic  matt i dont know  taliesin sighs theres no humane way to do this  sam sure there is kiki get a fey creature in here  laura yeah 
none	 thats what i was thinking send him in  marisha oh yeah they die and they go right back to their plane  sam no i think they just die  taliesin and even if they do go back to their plane they may not be able to in there they may  wither and actually die i just wanted to put that on the table  marisha are you trying to make me feel better about any of this  taliesin i dont want to lie to you about this ive been practicing intense levels of honesty if  
none	 not telling the whole truth  travis sidebar do we have all the vestiges that the sphinx told us about  sam no  travis what else is there  sam theres one in the fire plane  liam something for pickle  marisha the dawn martyr dawn martyr  travis i know im not the smartest one in the group but we dont know what the fuck were  talking about with this little sphere why dont we go find that last vestige and see what it turns up  laura i dont know if we have a lot 
none	 of time  taliesin we have time in a day  marisha i mean only if we  taliesin in a day she returns we chose a place we move our forces in there we have days where  she could be looking for us and then when she disappears its going to take a day or two for him  to really find out it will be about three to four days before anything actually happens  sam what are we doing going after this vestige when can any of us even use it  marisha and laura pike 
none	  travis well i can kima might im not much for poetry but it seems sort of poetic that thordak  came from the fire plane and the last vestige were looking for is in the fire plane  marisha also we might be able to find some information on the stone  laura this is true  sam the fire plane isnt just like dallas  taliesin it actually is quite like dallas i think thats a very reasonable comparison  sam its a horrible place where we could all die  travis well so was the feywild and 
none	 we didnt  sam were risking our hides for something that might benefit one of us maybe  laura well thats what weve been doing this entire time  travis thats basically all of our choices at this point  marisha we could go in with the rest of the fire ashari that are there we can meet up with  cerkonos is this whole ziggurat encased in  whitestone  matt the ziggurat itself is built from stone and then the upper exterior of it is covered in this  green glasslike substance that is distilled whitestone residuum  
none	 taliesin i have a plan it will take a little bit of time but its vicious  marisha what  taliesin it probably wouldnt work well lets find out what happens to a creature inside here  before we  travis a regular creature or a feywild creature  marisha okay i actually do have conjure woodland beings  laura thats not a magic creature though its a woodland being  marisha no woodland beings can be like fey creatures  laura really  marisha mmhmm  taliesin something small  travis do it oh my god do it  
none	 laura just a fairy just a teeny little fairy  marisha okay  matt what levels that that is  marisha third level  travis wait if you like conjure it outside and walk in is it going to go poof and disappear  laura potentially well find out  matt a fourth level you mean  marisha sorry fourth level  matt yeah so you can create some fey creatures yeah what are you summoning  marisha what makes sense  travis whats going to squeal  taliesin were on one side of the line send it to the 
none	 other see what happens  marisha ill summon a  sam little pixie  marisha a little stutters a little pixie  laura copying marisha lalittle lilittle li a little pixie  marisha a lillul lillul pixie  sam hi little pixie go in that room  taliesin this may be by the way how we deal with raishan  marisha what  matt okay so you conjure a pixie  marisha sure and i send her in  matt pixie flies in continues to fly in nothing happens  taliesin pixies fine  matt pixie seems fine  sam 
none	 pixies not a magical creature i guess  laura isnt it though  sam has magic maybe isnt a magical being  taliesin can you make the pixie do something try and have the pixie do something magical  marisha yeah i have them cant they cast like confusion or something like that or can they cast  sam polymorph  matt they can cast confusion they can cast polymorph they can cast things like that  marisha hey try and polymorph me  matt pixie turns around and nothing happens  marisha nothing  matt pixie looks confused what 
none	 sorry  taliesin its all right you did very well how do you feel do you feel all right  matt technically this pixie  travis touch it  matt well say for the purposes of this sure there is very basic communication the pixie is  taliesin tinkerbell  matt yeah sylvan is the language that it speaks so it is close enough to elvish that those who  speak elvish can like interpret elements of it  marisha oh i know sylvan i know sylvan hey how do you feel  matt a little queasy thats all  
none	 marisha queasy yeah  matt its weird  marisha hmm hey will you do me a favor and dont hold it against me  taliesin why dont you let it leave  travis just go do it just do it  marisha will you go touch that black orb  taliesin no no no dont do that  travis yeah yeah yeah go touch it she meant what she said  matt i mean shes only listening to her so  liam yeah it doesnt matter what percy says  travis do it fucking do it  sam lets see 
none	 if it goes to the other world  laura you dont know where it goes  taliesin thats right i dont know  liam no you dont know what shes talking about its esperanto  travis you dont speak sylvan  taliesin ive already done my dumb stuff for the day  laura stab stab stab  taliesin it wouldve been so badass  matt all right so yeah you continue to walk as the pixie floats up towards the top of the  ziggurat you get to the top and you notice that no all the bodies have been 
none	 removed its been  cleaned up  laura its just an empty pyramidy thing now  matt yeah its like this empty platform now with the walls encased within a small colosseum and  there it is the general spinning black marble the pixie approaches and like  laura and taliesin whines worriedly  marisha yeah yeah you got this  matt touches it and you watch the pixie go and is gone  marisha hmm so as we expected yeah  travis well hold on wait  laura wait  marisha i dont think shes coming back yeah  
none	 laura hey allura how many things did you throw in the orb  matt you see her in the back leaning against the wall like shes seen this a hundred times oh  many things chairs outfits pieces of stone metals weve put all kinds of things  sam any animals  liam anything alive  matt no nothing living  travis what was the biggest thing you put in there  matt your desk chair cassandra said it would be all right  taliesin sighs yes  laura have you put a box around it just encapsulated it completely 
none	  matt we tried and upon moving it once it contacted it did not move with the box it just  crushed and absorbed the box itself  taliesin so i have an interesting request which may end up being too complicated im not sure  travis probably  taliesin can we build a teleportation sigil directly above it outside of its range  matt given the better part of a year yes  liam so youre saying theres a chance  taliesin can we build one in the hallway leading to this room  matt a temporary one as 
none	 in like a  marisha like a spell  matt like a brief spell yes i can do that now its the permanent installation of one that takes  an exorbitant period of time  taliesin as long as we have some way of knowing what point at which we reenter this room then we  at least have a way of having it chase us into its range  marisha oh man  taliesin or better still if we run one way and it runs the other  marisha have you been in contact have you attempted to scry 
none	 or do a locate object spell on  anything that youve thrown in probably  matt yes but unfortunately theres been no way of connecting anything that goes through it just  vanishes  sam i think thats a fucking terrible idea  travis chanting fire plane  sam what are you talking about we cant lure a dragon into a teleportation circle big enough to  get a dragon through and then somehow assume that the dragons going to keep running into the room  with no magic and then what are we also going to assume that its 
none	 going to jump into the crazy  vecna circle and become a ninth level of hell after that we have no idea thats a terrible  idea im vetoing it  travis i third that  taliesin the cereal shiller has a point  liam that ideas not grrreat  laughter  laura youve been waiting waiting to find a time to say it havent you  liam nope just drunkenly popped in my head  taliesin yes grog you have a point  travis fire plane  taliesin if we are going to do the fire plane if that 
none	 is going to happen then we cannot go until  preparations start getting made for the place at which were going to have this confrontation we  need to pick a point preferably far from here is there a ruined city  sam what for us to lure raishanslashthordak to  laura what about fort daxio  sam fort daxios near emon and so is kymal  matt well its north of emon kymals east of it and the ironsea ridge but kymals filled  with civilians  laura fort daxio has an army gathering there already right  matt 
none	 well fort daxio has a piece of an army most of it went to syngorn and we havent heard since  taliesin fort daxio at least does have soldiers already  laura well syngorn is gathering their forces as well  matt have you reached out to syngorn let them know this was going to happen you mentioned that  they were coming to power  laura we have  matt well we need to reach out to the resources we have and call them in  laura and liam yes  taliesin everyone is fort daxio where this confrontation 
none	 is going to happen  laura we havent been to fort daxio  sam we should probably go check it out but everyone wants to go to the fire plane get some  armor  taliesin we go to fort daxio to start everything up while they prepare we can maybe make a trip  to the fire plane once things are prepared they will not need us to organize the armies and gather  forces  marisha its really frustrating i feel like we have all the pieces here i just cant figure it out  taliesin we have 
none	 all the pieces buried underneath every civilian  marisha im really obsessed on this ziggurat thing have you thrown any whitestone into the  ziggurat  taliesin no dont do that  laura im sure they already have  matt we have  sam its going to be fine keyleth after we kill thordak and raishan becomes superpowerful  raishan will come here and get the vecna orb and unleash all sorts of hells on the world and then  well know what it was  liam i mean thats basically whats going to happen  taliesin thats a very 
none	 good plan  sam yeah i mean we cant really do anything about it  marisha which is why its frustrating because i feel like we can beat her to the fucking punch  liam yeah i think thordaks a fucking meathead and we should take care of raishan ahead of time  marisha you already know how i feel  taliesin i think youre mad to think we can do that i think that youre mad to think were  actually going to see her again before the final confrontation  travis yeah were not going to see her 
none	  taliesin i think shes going to stay far far away  laura no she knows  taliesin i took that shot specifically to see where she was sitting and see where we were  sitting with her  laura you took that shot specifically to stab her three times in the back percy  taliesin it also worked that we found out she wasnt there  liam yes revisionist history  laura i thought you were practicing honesty  travis thats like saying i farted because my stomach hurt and then i found out it stunk as well  
none	 taliesin i was aware it could go horribly wrong which is why i was prepared to say something  liam likely theres a master plan we understand  taliesin im not saying it was the best plan  travis cool fort daxio then check it out  taliesin does anybody else have anything to say to this  marisha we basically dont have a plan were going somewhere until we come up with a plan in  the meantime  taliesin no were preparing all of our forces at fort daxio  matt cassandra says if fort daxio is to 
none	 be the place where this is to go down then that will be  the place well send our allies  marisha jesus lets put all of our eggs in one basket  sam yeah but what else are we saving them for this is it  taliesin this is the omelette where do we want our allies far away from the red dragon  marisha you dont feel like we are stepping into every trap that raishan has laid  sam what else can we do  marisha kill raishan first  sam you cant heal the disease we 
none	 cant control this orb theres nothing else we can do  marisha it doesnt matter we just need her to believe that i can cure her disease  laura lets be honest raishan wants thordak dead thats her endgame as well  liam thats the only thing we can count on  taliesin because right now raishan could have us all dead  travis are you saying you want raishan to go with you oneonone so you can do the melora thing and  then maybe you take her out and you want a shot at it before we try 
none	 anything else because ill  grant you that  marisha i could try thats what i was trying to bait her into  laura shes not going to show up  matt allura brings her hand up ive done plenty of research on these i mean no offense to you  keyleth but you convincing an entity that exists on deception through deception to believe you in  that regard and based on that conversation she already seems to see through that ruse i would  not recommend it  liam allura any chance you know the gate spell  
none	 matt no that is far beyond my capabilities  travis yeah rare spell that  taliesin im not mad in thinking that trusting this creature is the only option available at this  point i say trust walking in this direction is the only direction available at the moment any  attempt to counter her at this point leads to our destruction she has us  travis yeah no we got that so does anybody want to do anything else before we go to daxio  sam the only thing else that we can do before we go to daxio 
none	 is to send word to our allies i think  we should grab kash send him out a quick list of who we need to contact ravenites feywild wolves  laura and liam syngorn  liam zahra kash  laura your people keyleth  liam kima allura  travis wolves are on another plane herd is wandering  laura jmon  sam thats by flute wait what about our brotherhood of what do we belong to not the clasp  liam slayers take  sam the slayers take we can get them too right we have money we can hire 
none	 them we have a  hundred thousand gold  taliesin you want to hire them oh  laura we could take out a contract against the red dragon  sam sure  laura we can hire them to kill a red dragon  liam yeah what are we going to do with that money when were dead nothing  marisha we are sending everyone we know into one centralized location do we really feel like  thats a good idea  sam yes this is what weve built towards  marisha is it  taliesin were building a trap where 
none	 would you put them  marisha we didnt talk about throwing everyone we loved into the frying pan that was not the trap  sam what did you think we were making allegiances for just to hang out with them we need them to  fight and die for us  marisha im down for the cause of the war just not when its a stupid fucking plan  sam were going to be there too  marisha we dont have a plan were just asking everyone to meet in one location  liam well were talking about building an 
none	 army  marisha and then doing what with them  liam to kill the general  marisha and then doing what theyre just going to be sitting there theyre going to be sitting ducks  taliesin theyre not going to be sitting there were going to make tactical decisions about where  to place everyone in and around the fort  marisha ive accepted that people are going to die ive accepted that i do not condone sending  people to their slaughter when we dont have a goddamn plan  taliesin well whats your counter proposal because i feel 
none	 like were making a plan here  marisha i dont think that its smart to put every potential ally we know in one spot can we  not divide it up can we not find places nearby  taliesin they wont all just be in the fort everyone is going to be placed  sam once we get there and survey the area we can come up with a comfortable plan you can make some  caverns for them to hide in  taliesin were going to also create ways of making sure the dragon cant take flight were  
none	 going to make sure that everyone has a purpose and a place it will not be just a giant swath of  people ready to die  sam were just getting them in the right county  taliesin we just need everybody in the city  marisha but we also know that raishan knows everything that were going to do  laura she doesnt know fort daxio she doesnt know any of that  taliesin she doesnt know fort daxio honestly shes going to have to know shes going  to have to send them theres nothing we can do 
none	 about it  laura she doesnt know about jmon sa ord  marisha i dont trust that she doesnt know anything im going to assume that she knows  everything  taliesin thats a good assumption  travis yeah thats fair  taliesin even so theres nothing that shes not going to know because she is what is luring him  out if we fought him here she already knows where we are right now she knows where we are  she knows everybody thats here  sam i go behind keyleth and stab three times  laughter  taliesin 
none	 is this happening are we doing this im so excited yeah  sam no i would so lose  marisha bring it shes on edge all right  taliesin we have to play this the way we have to play it its dangerous but we have to assume  that she will most likely not betray us until the end  sam right now somewhere theres a man on an airship going do you see it yet  laura theyre keeping an eye out at this point all right  taliesin theyre being good we have to assume that she 
none	 has not betrayed where we are yet which  would have been so simple it would have been so simple just to raze this city to the ground  marisha look at what we did with ripley we walked into every trap she set for us blindly we  got cocky we got bold we fell for all of that  laura keyleth we have to fight eventually were not trying to be cocky about it were trying to  set up an army  sam might i point out keyleth that raishan wanted us to go to emon and 
none	 face thordak and we  are already not following that plan  laura this is true  taliesin that is the other option go there  liam we can count on her to be duplicitous we gather forces we take out thordak well figure out  how were going to do it were not saying throw every spaghetti at the wall we figure that out  then we talk about the real enemy  taliesin its a fort we prepare the fort it is what a fort is for  laura if the opportunity arrives to take out raishan then 
none	 we do it beforehand if not  immediately after thordak is dead  marisha we could all be dead  taliesin why are we not dead right now explain to me why we are not dead right now  marisha i honestly dont know  taliesin because this fight is going to happen that is why we are not dead right now its  the only possible explanation that i can conceive of this fight is inevitable once this fight has  happened oh were dead after this fight i have no doubt that we are in grave danger  
none	 laura after this fight there wont be enough people to bring us back anymore  laughter  taliesin but this fight this first fight is going to happen and we need our forces and we  need them prepared and we need them not marching into a city we need them in a city holding siege  preparing to tackle to grapple and to subdue as best we can to be difficult to find to be  surrounding we need all of these things and we cannot do any of these things unless we bring him  to a place
