tavern	 are triumphant  laura as always  travis as always its the wee hours of the morning and we have found our way to a tavern  small maybe off the beaten path right its shambly outside we go in and its deserted  right theres only like one other couple in the whole fucking place we got the run of the lot we  go in its time to drink were raising glasses were cheering were drinking everybodys  boozing right yeah who wants to make a toast  liam this is the game  sam ill make a 
none	 toast ill make a toast yeah clears throat right then my character has a  different accent than scanlan does  travis youre just playing you though  sam well i know but i want to get into it right  laura no i like it  sam right then we did a really good job in the fight today so i think that we should all propose  a toast to the one that fell keyleth im sorry shell never be joining us again to keyleth  liam thats an odd story choice to make  travis cheers yeah 
none	 to keyleth underpowered her whole life really nothing at her disposal  liam the last of us  travis may her memory live forever  laura mmhmm  travis as we are drinking and were on like whats a big number our second cup everybodys  really starting to feel it a little bit especially our little gnome pike pike gets up on  the table right shes like pike flower my friend pike gets up and shes like you guys i  love being your friend  taliesin too real  liam the dimensional distortion there for a second 
none	  travis im really like all of your friend you are good and she turns to you vex yeah and  shes like you know were so close and you know i gulping and you start to see right  that maybe shes had one too many which is really saying something for that little tank she goes  ah nope i got it urp and in that moment you start to see all the color come up to her face i  need you to roll a dexterity check  laura okay  sam what does that mean whats 
tavern	 a dexterity check  travis i dont know i heard a guy at the bar say it  laura im going to roll one of these fancy gems that i have all right oh thats really good oh  wait just a check 11 plus 18 no 29 that means its 29  sam how do you know what to add  laura im really smart im very smart  travis yeah totally right so 29 thats great at the last moment you see what is bound to  be a shoot of vomit in your face and you just 
tavern	 boop duck out of the way she catches it with her  lips and this little stream of bile comes like shooting out and goes over your shoulder  laura i want to grab a glass and try to catch it in a mug so it doesnt get all over the floor  you know  travis you raise the glass right in front of her face as she sees it she sees more alcohol in the  glass and she goes mm and turns away and paints the bar except that other couple that was  in the bar 
none	 with you theyre right in the path of her destruction yeah and she alphabits and  lucky charms all over the place all over the table on this couple you see as this gentleman  this greenishskinned with large lower teeth and a hood and a cloak stands up and starts to turn  toward you hes like what the fuck  laura so sorry about all of the vomit  travis yeah is she with you  laura yes she is  travis well im sure you guys are going to take care of this right i mean its 
none	 in my drink  its on my food its on my and you see with him is also this very lovely lady shes got  slightly bluish skin and she is also like staring in revulsion at all of this mess that  shes wearing right its on her maybe theres a little bit hanging off of her lip she starts to  go wha gulping what  laura oh no i hold the cup under her mouth as well  travis she holds it in but this really infuriates this halforc looking gentleman he  stands up right and 
none	 hes like thats it you and i you you and i were coming to blows i  want answers for this  liam i was just standing here  travis nope ive stood up im making a point that doesnt make any difference and im too  embarrassed to back down now  liam yes but wait one second grog youre very good at this have you been spending time at the  theater and not telling us  travis whats a theater  liam lets fight this fucking guy what do i do do i actually use this or 
none	 what do i do are we  fighting  travis nope imagination weapons yeah you tell me what you want to do  liam i would like to poke him in the eyes  travis with what  liam these  travis oh yeah okay so you yeah take one of those big globular like d20 dices  liam all right im going to use this weird  travis the mansion provides  liam im going to use this weird purple one where you cant read the numbers on it  travis roll to hit  liam i think it 
none	 says 13 and what  travis the servants bring over a sheet that has modifiers for you to use yeah these are things  you add  laura what do you add to it  liam i think im improvising this weapon is that accurate all right so i would add i have no  fucking idea you know what im going to do im going to add my wisdom modifier  laura why wisdom no its strength  liam why would i add anything  travis hes pretty wise  liam how strong are my fingers is that the 
none	 point sure ill add my strength to my fingers  so 15  travis 15 thats all you need you boink right in his eyes and hes like argh in the eyes  liam thats fucking hilarious  travis right the girl stands up at the table and shes like no no please not his eyes  liam i have four of these  travis right and she sees you standing there ready to go and shes like no please please  liam you threaten me all the time  laura yeah but she doesnt have any weapons on her 
none	  liam neither do i  travis actually do you want to see if she has any weapons  laura oh well im very perceptive grog you know that  travis oh you are perceptive right roll a perception check  laura okay  liam this game thinks of everything  laura a 31  travis you dont see anything unfortunately thats just unfortunate  laura grog 31 is higher than 15 31s really high its high  travis right so you see her genealogy going back like four generations  laura do you even know what genealogy is  
none	 travis yeah its like you know a blue denim yeah so you see at her side this spear thats  laying up against the table yeah yeah i dont know how you missed it the first time its a  fucking spear right there she stands up and shes like no no please no more eyepoking  sam grog grog im going to try to turn invisible if thats all right can i just do that  travis i dont know can you just do that or do you roll  sam i normally just do that  travis okay 
none	 go invisible  sam all right im going to go invisible and im going to try to swipe the spear before she gets to it  travis okay roll a stealth check  sam okay seven plus ten so its ten this many  travis ten total okay great so you go invisible right and you walk over behind the  blueskinned lady and right as you get to the spear you grab for it but theres something that  catches your eye and you fumble the spear and it falls to the ground  sam oh shite i dropped 
tavern	 the spear  travis good i love it as she hears the spear fall she turns and she swings her hand wildly  catching you dead in the face boom knocks you back you fly back onto your back five feet you  take two points of damage  liam youre intelligent do you understand what is happening  taliesin not in the least none of this makes any sense these numbers seem completely arbitrary  sam hes so good at this though i feel like we should keep supporting this  laura i feel like were in a tavern 
none	 right now  taliesin i think he might have eaten something in the back this is not normal  sam hes never been good at anything intellectual and now this is it so maybe we should support him  and go with it  travis scanlan the reason that you fumbled for the spear is that you saw this small little bundle  next to her chair in fact it looks like  laura is it a baby  travis it looks like a small baby all swaddled up in cloth no small  taliesin is the baby also covered 
none	 in vomit  laura wait i have a question are we teeny at this moment or are we normal sized  travis no yeah im going to put this out like whats that game where you move the  sam sorry  laura parcheesi checkers chess  travis yeah that one well be like that on a big map  sam really quickly into my earring i say shes got a baby with her  laura oh are we going to fight a baby now  sam i dont know just thought you might like to know  travis well 
none	 youre not that far from her so she goes it is a baby it is please we just want  to leave im sorry if we caused you any trouble  laura does it really look like a baby  travis would you want to go over to it  laura i want to go over and look at the baby  travis yeah walk on over and make a perception check its a baby  liam im sorry i know i keep slowing things down here but in this imagination game can we do  anything that we do 
none	 in life  travis good question yeah  liam can we do things that we cant do in life  travis you can try  liam that sent a shiver down my spine  travis pretty much if you get an idea and you want to try it you ask me well roll a dice  then ill let you know how it goes  liam i would like to cast faerie fire  sam you dont do that  liam yes i do i had the craziest dream last night scanlan  sam that you became part druid  
none	 liam yeah and then i died and then i wasnt here and then i was and then there was like  three weeks where i was a father in this other city washing dishes and i had this car there  were no horses but it was just wind i had these kids i dont know who these kids were  taliesin i feel like we have warned you about eating cheese before bed  travis the moldy cheese the point of this is theres a small baby right and youve got a  couple covered in puke and shes 
none	 asking if maybe they can leave instead of avoid further scrum  laura well i fink we should let them leave i fink im listening to grog too much  liam im going to save that for later im going to put these away  travis you see his demeanor like he totally goes like another eyepoking avoided whoosh  right he says all right people make mistakes try to enjoy the rest of your night he goes over  and gets his blueskinned wife up and she grabs her little bundle and they start to make their  way 
tavern	 out of the tavern  taliesin i grab the spear  travis you do  taliesin yes they didnt take it so i will take it now its my spear  laura thats terrible they do seem suspicious can i read their lips on the way out are they  talking can i read their lips  travis sure  laura what are they saying  travis roll a d20  liam everybody seems to know whats going on  laura am i adding anything to it  travis perception do a perception check  sam just yes and vax 
none	 yes and  laura 24 thats good  travis whoa so you see that shes actually going like that was so embarrassing i want to go home  and take my clothes off and you and i go and well have a great night  laura okay i think they really want to go bone  travis yeah lots of boning in their future  taliesin i wish to examine the spear is it a special spear is it an interesting spear does it  do anything does it require batteries  travis batteries what are batteries you see the 
tavern	 spear is a long wooden pole wrapped with some  cloth where you might hold it with your hands at the tip is a very rusted metal sharp point at the  tip you got yourself a spear so now now you truly have the tavern to yourself its just us  five yeah you see grog sitting there and hes aghast at how rude pike was to puke all over this  couple and that you would go and poke them in the eyes grogs very dignified no thats not true  grog goes over to pike and goes 
tavern	 okay pikeypoo maybe its time to lets put you to sleep  upstairs barkeep and you look behind the tavern and there is a fuck in your mind hes  fucking over there  taliesin its a muscle reaction its inevitable  travis he might be over there in a second stay with me so grog picks up pike and goes over to  the barkeep and hes like do you have any rooms that i can put this little gnome in and hes  like yes i have i do have rooms  sam good voice grog  travis 
none	 wheezing how much money do you have and grogs like i have ten gold and hes like  sure thatll fucking do it so grog goes and takes pike upstairs puts her in a room comes  back down and like whoa she is hammered  laura ten gold for a room grog is a lot  travis i dont know if you know but im super rich because i never really buy anything  laura you do buy some things  travis i always seem to find the money thats what i do find the money so now it 
tavern	 turns out  that your cups are all slightly emptier than before your plates are rather empty it doesnt  really seem like we want the night to end does somebody want to maybe check with the barkeep and  see if he has any more  liam grog not grog but grog did we get any points  travis points  sam he does not understand this game  travis oh right oh like did we do something right  liam did we win  travis no actually like at the end of this story you either win or 
none	 lose like overall  laura oh are you going to judge us does one of us win more than other people  travis potentially  taliesin did you not take any drama classes as a child  laura im going to win so good  travis dont you like the theater  liam i love the theater but were playing a game  travis oh yeah no its one big long game preferably three to four hours long  laura thats a long game grog  liam i thought we were near the end of the game but were just 
none	 getting started  travis oh were just kicking this shit off get comfy  sam if were going to be here for a while grog can i have some of my invisible servants come in  and lightly play a light accompaniment music play some strings or flutes  travis set the tone the mood totally  sam oh there it is its nice  travis hold on can you ask them to bring in some like meats like a meat and cheese plate  sam i actually cant  travis come on kaylie wont fucking know please im so 
tavern	 tired of this green shit  sam i will know shell be able to read it on my face she can see all of my lies  liam its a game its makebelieve  sam oh if its makebelieve then here you go here are your meats for you right there  travis nope you got to stay in the game thats only in the game with that stuff so youre in the  tavern you need more to drink who wants to go talk to the barkeep  taliesin ill go talk to the barkeep  travis what do 
none	 you do  taliesin another round for everyone your finest  travis eh  taliesin shouting another round for everyone your finest  travis oh yes yeah oh to drink or to eat  taliesin to drink another round of drinks for everyone  sam ask him his name  taliesin why would i do your finest whats your name  liam we want to get fucked up  taliesin why do i care about his name  sam because i want to hear what grog comes up with  taliesin but his name is grog  travis my name 
tavern	 its bob  taliesin all right ill admit that is quite charming  travis bobaline is my full name but people call me bob  taliesin bobaline i feel really is quite appropriate  travis its a family name if you want more to drink unfortunately i was not planning on you  being here its quite late i do however have more food in the pantry below the bar or there  are some extra casks of ale out with the pigs  taliesin i dont understand how a bar runs out of alcohol after one round for five 
none	 of us  sam its not run out he said he has more downstairs or theres some outside in the back  laura i think we should go down to the cellar  liam bobaline are you going to go down and get it and bring it up or are you  travis no unfortunately me son is the one who normally goes and gets it hes not here  taliesin whats your sons name  travis timothy  taliesin bobaline and timothy thats excellent i should write that down to make sure that you  dont forget it or 
none	 screw it up later  sam vax hes presenting us with a choice  we as a group must make this choice together  liam hes sending us to his basement  thats creepy  travis well its not a huge deal i just need one of you to either go down and get the food  and one of you to go get the ale  laura you and i will go down to the cellar  travis yeah you go down to the cellar and grog i will go get the ale unless somebody  wants to go 
none	 out in the pig sty ill go  liam we will go with you grog to the pig sty  travis or do you two want to go get the ale  sam i volunteer to go to the sty  travis okay cool so you vax and sam you make your way out back scanlan  liam im not going to the basement because once in syngorn a comic book shop owner tried to get  me to go to the basement to look at comic books and im not doing that yeah so good luck in the  
tavern	 cellar lets go see the pigs  travis as vax and scanlan start to head  toward the back door vex and percy  would you like to try and find  the latch under the bar that leads  laura yes we would  travis you find it fuck its right there good job right so you lift the latch in the  floor and you go down its a very small room that has different salted meats and cheeses and some  bread and stuff like that  taliesin this cellar has better food  than your mansion 
none	  laura we take it all  travis you take armfuls  laura after a little bit  travis i mean do you want to see maybe what else is down there  laura yeah lets see what else is down there  travis roll perception checks  laura oh this is good 28  taliesin 23  travis nice you also see three of these bottles with hided belted locks on it and it says  sandkheg on there it looks really really expensive theres three bottles of that yep  laura im going to try to pick the 
none	 lock so i can get them can i do that  travis sure what do you roll to pick a lock  liam i dont know whether to shit or go blind in this game  laura what do i roll to pick a lock  sam vax has no idea  travis what about liam what does liam know  liam intelligence id think yeah you have to know how locks work  laura id think its dexterity or something  taliesin dex proficiency for gods sake  travis roll for it  liam what are those words youre 
none	 using  taliesin were you never in school  have you never done this before  liam i didnt pay attention through any of school i copied everything that she wrote down  taliesin this is everything i did in school  i remember this game  laura 15  travis oh thats not very good unfortunately this is a better expensive bottle of sandkheg  after trying to break the lock or pick it you get the lockpick stuck in there yeah and its  all fucked up but youre really resilient and you smash the top of the 
none	 bottle it seems stupid to  have a lock on a glass bottle but it works  laura i dont want to smash the bottle  travis you did it already its too bad  laura is all the drink spilling out  travis no you just smashed the top off you have the rest of the bottle  laura well okay thats good  taliesin we should try it  laura yeah  travis you got some salted meats some cheese  laura and this bottle of fanciness we have to drink it all because we cant close it 
none	 back up  travis you also see some dead rats in the corner some empty shelves and one old leathery book  yeah its all dusty shelves  taliesin oh shelves  laura do you see anything else percy  travis theres a leathery book on one of the shelves  taliesin theres a leathery book im taking the leathery book my god  travis do you want to open it up  taliesin i want to read the title  there should be a title on the cover  books have titles on covers  travis yeah they do 
none	 it says ledger  taliesin it says ledger im going to open up the book  laura while he opens it im going to take a sip of this fancy wine  travis great yeah roll a constitution check  sam youve really caught onto this game quickly  laura 13  travis 13 right you take a sip and boy does it burn youre like gagging you feel like you  could breathe fire it starts to spread down into your chest  laura does it make me breathe fire  travis no not literal fire like gasps fire 
none	  taliesin vex why are you making a keyleth face  laura this what is it called  travis sandkheg  laura this sandkheg is really strong  taliesin well ive got to try this really quickly  travis oh jesus  taliesin i take a sip sip sip  laura you have to be very careful because its jagged on the top  taliesin i know you have to be very careful because theres broken glass  travis roll a constitution check  liam what kind of role playing are we doing here  taliesin the best kind no 
none	 i rolled a four  travis yeah so the warmth starts to spread right  taliesin oh my  travis you also feel this immediate desire to upchuck the liquid because its so strong in your  rush to cover your mouth you drop the bottle and it shatters all over the floor  sam do we hear it upstairs  taliesin we speak of this never again  laura ever nobody knows  taliesin we should open the book though  laura yeah lets open this ledger  travis you open the book and its got numbers in it 
none	 with letters  taliesin are they in a particular order  travis i guess  taliesin using my deftness of wit can i start to put together some meaning to the numbers and words  within this ledger  travis unfortunately no its beyond your mental prowess so back upstairs  taliesin goddamn it  laura all of the food were carrying meat and cheese and all of that  travis yall want to stay in the pantry or come back up  laura we did for a while  travis yeah you stayed down there for a while  
none	 taliesin for a while  laura and then we came back up  travis fair enough vax and scanlan yall head out back  liam were getting ale for our buddy grog got to keep the big man hydrated  sam thats right we have to hell know if we dont get him some so lets go sneaky back there  to make sure theres no monsters hiding  liam do you know how to sneak with dice  sam sure  liam how do you do it  sam we tell our bunion master that were going out there

none	 off  laura wheres trinket  gasps grog trinkets here  trinkets popping out of my necklace  travis there you go  liam what you got a fucking bear  travis look at that youre all there  liam where did you get these toys  travis i stole it from a small child so as you look around your environment you notice the floor  is stone the walls are stone and you seem to be in some sort of circular cavern theres also a  domed ceiling above you there is just pure wall for most of 
none	 this circular room except for an area  that seems to lead into another chamber beyond  laura oh i have an idea can i shoot one of my oracle arrows and see whats in the other room  travis you may roll an attack  liam also i rolled a 39 for stealth  laura i rolled a 45  liam is that good is 39 better or worse than 45  travis its so good in fact that you take one step into the wall and you turn and face it like  the creepy person from blair 
none	 witch and you stay there  laura 32  travis 32 great so you turn so that you can see into the other cavern and you shoot your oracle  arrow and your sight goes zooming and you see it fly approximately counting 25 feet and it  just hits another wall made of stone in the cavern very similar to the one youre in  laura it looks the exact same  travis yeah almost identical to this one  liam jeez grog youre inspired today  taliesin this is very impressive  sam come on even in this 
none	 imaginary game were invincible heroes of justice lets just go look  laura can we see forward can we see  liam well hold on we know that i like to stick my dick into things so why dont i creep ahead  and see what is happening  travis very smart make a perception check  laura watch for traps you dont want to explode i dont know what grog has set up for us  liam ill roll this one with the book on it because i feel goodness from it i got a 19 on  that 
none	 plus perception oh my gosh thats really good 33 for perception  travis you open your eyes and because youre staring at the wall like a nerd you notice the  mortar is very fine would anybody like to make a perception check besides vax  laura i would like to look around the whole room  travis vex please roll a perception check  liam i didnt understand the rules  taliesin 17 for me  travis oh very nice percival  laura 34 for me  travis 34 that is a high perception you should be a rogue 
dung	  liam its not as high as mine i would like to point out but i was facing the wall  travis so you see that the room extends out to an edge and you move to the middle and you see that  these two rooms seem to be identical there are torches lighting your way and above you on this  rounded ceiling there are two hatches iron hatches and above them you see maybe a chute  and you wonder as you see water dripping  from the hatches in the ceiling  if that might have 
none	 been how you got in this room  laura can i use my broom to fly up and check out that hatch  travis you may so you fly up and you get to the hatch and its solid iron with rusted theres  water dripping out of it and you see there is a chute indeed no light coming from it  laura its bars  travis bars but it looks as if it goes straight up and up and up  laura is it closed off  travis it is its closed very securely  laura can i 
none	 try to pull them  liam may i turn around from the wall first  travis you may yes there you go  liam can i use some sort of perception or insight or one of these numbers to figure out if  we are in a room shaped like a cock and balls  travis you may roll a perception check  liam okay ive got a total of 23 grog  travis you move forward and as you approach vex you do see there is an additional hallway  that extends forward not in the shape of a 
none	 cock and balls per se but there is another  hallway in front of you and it extends forward into darkness but you do see a very faint torch  at the end of it all  sam a tip  travis tip of the hallway yeah  liam im a big fan of the show stillben vandal its quite good  travis so you are going up ooh this is you  laura can i pull on the bars to see if i can get out  travis yeah you pull on it and man that shit is roll 
none	 a strength check ill give you a shot  laura because im really strong grog nine  travis no no it doesnt even move it doesnt even do the pothole thing as soon as you step  on it it goes boop boop im going to fall  but no its solid  laura is there a lock to be seen  travis not that you can tell if you want to check and see if theres a latch to it  laura i want to look and see  travis roll an investigation check  laura ooh grog what 
none	 a big word what is that 23 23  travis 23 you reach through one of the slots in the plate thats holding  laura did you burp  liam i did burp  laura really stinky burp  liam i love you too stubby  travis you put your hand through and as your fingers curl around you do feel a very large  latch but it is thick and very secure and it extends into the mass around it the wall itself  you get the impression that it would take quite a mechanism to unleash this thing 
none	  laura okay all right  sam well lets go explore im going to walk around the room im going to walk up the shaft  travis you both head down the hallway  laura im going to follow them down the shaft  sam maybe you left me right  travis whats the marching order here  sam ill be to the right of the shaft hes pants left  liam but slowly move up the shaft  sam you dont want to go too fast down the shaft  travis you said to the right of the hallway 
none	 and youre going to be on the left to the left  sam no no hes all the way on the left wall  travis vax  liam i will follow behind scanman  travis okay and vex  laura behind percy and trinkets going to stand next to you grog because he loves you so much  sam just going to really just snug the edges of the shaft  liam yeah you know palm the sides as you go  laura just move forward nice and easy  travis would you like to proceed down the hallway  
none	 sam yes  travis okay so you move forward  sam we do move forward  taliesin gently checking for traps  sam i did not say that  travis well as scanlan is just ahead of you in your pursuit down the hallway scanlan feels his  foot fall on a piece of the floor and it sinks  laura oh no  travis you hear a grinding noise that youve heard before in our adventures and its not good  and instinctually you look to your right immediately on the wall and you notice there are  all 
none	 these holes in the wall  laura oh no  travis and sure enough just as youre looking a fucking dart sinks right into your cheek just  poof right into your yelling  sam screaming my cheek it burns it burns  travis and just as your hands go up to your face another one hits you in the thigh  laura back up scanlan back up  travis as you turn around one sinks into your butt cheek  liam i pull him back  travis yeah you pull him back you take  liam what if i 
none	 suck the poison out  sam we dont know if its poisoned yet  liam well just on principle just on principle  travis you take 13 points of fucking dart damage  liam is that a lot is that all you have  sam i assume not i assume im okay  travis you look at the wound in his cheek and the wound in his arm chest area they dont seem  so bad but the one in his butt is starting to swell a little bit kind of bruised and red  laura yeah you should definitely 
none	 suck the poison out  liam i definitely should or i could use my paladin ability  laura no you should just suck it out  sam i pull down my pants  travis make a medicine check as you suck on scanlans ass  liam okay im feeling lucky though  laura oh no  liam but it knocked the first die into a higher number can i go with that  taliesin thats not how the game works no  liam weve never played this game before  travis i will make a ruling because you are sucking 
none	 on scanlans ass you may roll with  advantage  liam not for the first time so go again look at what i got thats a good ass suck right there  sam ill be the judge of that  liam 19 how did i do  travis fantastic you manage to get the right amount of pressure right on the butt cheek right  and you suck all the poison out and you spit it out because you know if you swallow it also bad  for you and you manage to take your head away just in time 
none	 as a scanlan little boop farts out  liam i wave it away and then i take the opportunity to do one of these blows raspberry  travis oh man yeah nothing like moms kisses thats nice good job so youve taken 13 points  of damage youve pointed it out i assume to the rest of the group  sam theres lots of holes with darts in them what what  laughter  taliesin oh no  travis yeah in this game if you notice something call it out to each other because what  one person sees the 
tavern	 other somehow might not see and just because you know it at the table doesnt  mean that you know it in your mind pictures  liam you just made that up  travis thats how this goes i promise  liam where did you learn this game  travis i was in a tavern and this longhaired guy was playing a game at the table and i thought  it was fucking great and i watched for a while like hours i was hooked  i might go back next week and watch  sam do you need any 
none	 kind of subscription to watch it or can you  travis im not sure actually thats a great question  laura so wait so you saw darts coming out of the wall then  sam yeah theres traps theres lots of traps down the shaft  laura okay so you guys ill let you go ahead  taliesin im going to carefully examine the floor  travis so you notice that right here  sam that is a permanent marker  travis it is i dont give a shit there is this area  sam is that yours  taliesin 
none	 matts going to get his that mat is permanently scarred  travis yeah i dont fucking care or you have to build a map with that integrated into it you  notice that that area of the floor you step on it bad shit happens  liam every map has a dick in it from here to eternity  laura so we dont step on that section  travis well you havent gone past it yet would you like to try and cross that area  liam i will start looking for traps up this shaft  travis nice be 
none	 very careful with the shaft okay if you would like to try and cross over that  area you all need to make an acrobatic check as you try and leap over  liam jump over that spot  laura jump over it whoa 33 grog  travis thats good  taliesin 22  sam 17  travis 17  liam ooh yes 36  travis 36 everyone but vax manages to leap over successfully over well done vax catches his  foot hes like yells and he falls flat on his face and the darts go pew pew pew 
none	 vex if you  want to turn you can try and drag your brother who has luckily had all the darts go above his  lying goofy body on the floor and try to pull him off the plate  laura yes i would love to try and pull my brother to safety  liam i like to evade stuff like this can i use some sort of evasion  travis unfortunately no strength check  liam i knew this was what this game would be i knew it  laura yeah a strength check oh gosh im not very 
none	 strong grog ooh 22  travis thats enough because vax doesnt have very many muscles so you pull him off the plate  and hes there all of you are right there ready to go again  laura what about trinket and grog  travis all right yeah hold on look grog makes it over and then trinket comes up roll a  acrobatics check for trinket  liam grog i didnt see anything hit you but i might better just suck poison out of your ass  just to be sure  travis you know what save it for 
none	 later  laura im going to say thats a 14 for trinket  travis ooh yeah so unfortunately  laura grog save him as he falls  travis sure so he falls and i start to hear the grinding again and i pull him by his ear and  whoop everybodys on the safe side of the trap  what would you like to do next  liam i would like to see if there are any more traps before we get to the tip  travis roll a perception check  liam perception which one is this theres a 
none	 picture of a monk on this one  liam dungeons and flagons perception 22  travis 22 yes indeed there are no further traps towards the tip but your keen halfelf ears  pick up a wind blowing sound  laura does it sound like ghosts that we have encountered  travis turn back and you spin on your heel and outside of grogs amazing deltoids which  look swollen from shoulder day you see behind you a spectral form starting to make its way  towards you  laura oh no  sam its a ghost of some sort 
none	 holding a shovel  travis i need you all to roll initiative  liam what  taliesin initiative  liam whats initiative  taliesin what were rolling  liam thats a die youre rolling a die  taliesin yes you roll your initiative die  liam i had so many ghosts in that box over there travis  travis i already bought that one  liam i brought six tubs of miniatures so many miniatures  sam you bought that ghost with a shovel already  travis yeah it was two dollars or something  sam why is he holding 
none	 a shovel  laura 24  liam 16  travis 16 percy  taliesin 16  travis wow 16 percy really  taliesin 16 i rolled very poorly  sam 14  travis vex youre up first you see the spectral form starting to move towards you  what would you like to do  laura oh im going to shoot an arrow at it  travis you shoot an arrow at it  laura from a blazing bowstring because why not  travis okay roll to hit  laura 25  travis hold on wait theres music and shit 
none	 fuck  sam shall i tell the unseen servants to change the music  travis yeah  sam play something more rousing please  thank you  liam what what  sam im not in character now im just scanlan  travis im sorry what was it  laura shit 25  travis hit yeah that definitely hits  laura okay oh jeez im going to decide what i should you know attack should sure ten  plus oh i didnt hunters mark him  because im stupid  travis yeah too late for that  laura 15 plus fire 
none	 15 plus eight is 23  travis 23 nice  liam look at grog on that board looks like hes staring and judging the toys  laura and then for my bonus action  liam a what  laura can i have trinket jump across the thing that he just crossed and attack the ghost too  travis yeah roll an acrobatic check first  laura although i dont think i can actually have him attack after i shot an arrow  travis oh then no  laura yes i can because i only attacked once thats how it works 
none	  liam bonus action this is what all those ballet classes for trinket were for right now  laura thats an 11 for him  travis for the acrobatic check  trinket falls right on the plate and hes like  boom and then because it shot all those darts  and vax fell and they were like oh none  of the darts hit theyre all aimed down  and trinket takes like six darts he looks like the guy in the godfather  hes like distressed bear sounds darts covered in darts trinket takes  sam dont worry 
none	 vex its not realtrinket its imaginationtrinket realtrinket is still alive  travis 24 points of damage  laura thats a lot  travis but he manages with his bear strength  to pull himself just out of the line of fire  but he is right there  laura can he continue his attack  probably not can i attack with my second arrow  travis no vax youre up  liam i will run at the ghost right because i have to get up to it  i could throw but wheres the fun in that  so i 
none	 run at the ghost  and im going to use whisper and im going to dagger dagger dagger  and im going to use the power of my deity and do something called divine smiting  ive never told you guys what its called but its called divine smite  travis well give me an acrobatics check  because you jump over the plate area  you want to run into melee with the ghost  liam yeah so thats 33  travis you learn from your previous errors and man up  and you totally make it across just 
none	 fine  liam yeah i rolled lower than the last time great i jump across run  how do i hit it with my knife  travis you stab it  liam okay  travis roll to attack  liam okay so i roll once im going to use my  laura your second luck of the day  liam i have endless luck its endless  thats a one so instead i get a 19  travis a 19 which hits  liam it does oh my gosh god theres all these numbers on this piece of paper  
none	 laura youve used two of them  liam ive used 17 lucks it was a six im not very good at math i copied all of her answers  i think thats around 13 plus eight 21  and then the divine smite  which im going to peg somewhere around 3d8  so a 31 thatll do  38 that was a 42 44  grog 44 points of damage  travis boy thats a lot of damage  with that divine smite  liam feathers everywhere david bowiestyle  does it hurt the ghost  travis boy it 
none	 really does you see him go like ouch and his form shivers and stuff  and hes like pained sounds you see the area where you stab evaporates  and then comes back into form  but hes still standing there  he gleams at you  with these fucking dead ghost eyes  laura is he a dwarf ghost because he seems rather short he is a dwarf ghost  travis yep yeah he is a dwarf ghost  liam but i can attack so many times grog  can i do another quickie  laura i only got 
none	 one arrow  you only get one dagger  travis thats fair  that sounds like a good idea  liam is that how it works  travis yeah thats how it works  he turns to you after being like  it hurts so bad you really hurt him really bad  and he is going to use horrifying visage on you  liam what the fuck is that  travis yeah i need you to make a wisdom saving throw  liam a wisdom saving throw okay so i dont have any of that oh thats good i 
none	 rolled an 18  travis oh that succeeds you see him almost glare into your soul you feel your little  butthole pucker and youre like oh no its so scary but you shake it off because youve seen  so much worse in your time yeah and you throw up the doublebirds and hes like hissing and you  shake it off thats good percy its your turn  taliesin yes well im going to back up  and take a shot at this  travis back away from the ghost or towards him  taliesin no away from 
none	 the ghost away from the ghost a bit and im going to take a shot  ill just take one since it seems were being sporting about it so im going to use my magical  psychic shot and thats not bad thats a 24  travis 24 hits  taliesin all right well then im going to do that plus this and im also going to hit him  with a bit of electricity as well  travis yeah do it  taliesin ooh thats lovely thats ten points of damage plus six points  of psychic damage  
none	 plus four points of electricity  travis that is just enough you hit him and his form you hear this shriek and he just  turns into a puff of smoke  disappears into nowhere and the ghost is gone  calm retakes the hallway  laura back towards the tip  sam yes musicians calm down  liam lets refocus on the shaft  taliesin im going to peruse the rest of the  travis make a perception check to explore the hallway  liam just the tip though percy  taliesin if i get too close to the 
none	 tip i might experience a burning sensation from the torch 20  travis 20 yeah thats great you move forward and you see no doorways no exits but you do see  a line near the end of the hallway that seems to be a bit of an inequality in the rocks almost  like if you push on it something might happen  laura maybe you should push on it percy  liam we should backtrack the way we came  taliesin really all right im pushing on it  travis yeah yeah you push on it give me 
none	 a strength check  taliesin oh this will go well  liam push it real good  taliesin pushing push it oh no  that would be a  liam thats the lowest number  you can get on that thing  taliesin that is indeed the lowest number  you can get  travis right strangely you lean into it about to give it a big shove but your feet slip out  from under you on the slick rock  and you fall flat on your face and you bite  a bit of your tongue and lip 
none	  taliesin lisping i could use some assistance  with this please  sam ill show you how its done  scanlan in real life is not a very strong person but im playing my character  as very strong so scanlan runs in  and pushes hard on the wall  travis great yeah make a strength check  sam ooh 16  travis 16 you lean in and you push having percy just like little bloody mouth right next to  you and sure enough the wall starts to move but you can see light coming from the 
none	 other side its  just too heavy for you to move  sam i need some help over here  laura trinkets going to run over  damn it he has to cross the thingy again  taliesin hes going to have to cross the thingy again  travis you know what i got it grog goes up towards the end of the hallway  hes like maybe ill just fucking handle this you guys dont worry  and he rolls a million and the door flies open  almost comes off whatever invisible hinges it had  like rock 
none	 falls out of the door  liam just like life  travis yeah pretty much i know doors cant faze me the rest of you its a problem  not always true you see before you a lit cavern something off in the distance but youre still  in the doorway what do you do  sam a lit cabin  travis liam and taliesin cavern  laura im going to shoot another oracle arrow into the lit cavern  travis do you have another oracle arrow  laura i do i have one more  travis yeah roll to 
none	 attack shoot  laura 26  travis you nock and you pull and you release and your vision goes into the arrow and it shoots  forward you see stone floors beneath you and all of a sudden it shoots past what looks like a  flowing fountain of water and it just arcs past and you see as it clears past the fountain a  small furry shape on the ground and it hits into a ground and it scatters and the arrow shatters  on the floor  laura theres a furry shape theres an animal in there 
none	 lets go in i walk into the room  travis okay so would you all like to follow her you all want to go  liam im going to hang back at the tip of the wang there  travis vax hangs back  laura oh no we all fell over  travis you all fell over there you go so you see this fountain right here  laura jesus h thats lovely grog  travis scanlan right here and vax over here  liam yeah i dont want to leave i dont want to go i feel safe in

none	 do a perception check is that what youre doing for traps  sam i think its investigation  travis okay do roll an investigation check  laura 12  travis 12 there do not appear to be any traps  laura great then i walk forward towards the fountain and past it  sam i will stick with her so i can protect her  laura thank you scanlan  taliesin youre not doing the voice anymore  sam thats only when i incharacter talk to someone else  taliesin oh so this is the narrative the narrative voice is 
none	 different  travis you see before you what looks like a dog  a tiny little dog where is the dog  wheres the dog gone  right about here at the edge of your vision  taliesin is the dog over there by bigbys hand  laura do you want this to be a dog  travis sure yeah well use this to be a dog heres the dog right here  sam did you buy a dog  travis no its one of liams  it was in the box  liam eight tubs of minis eight tubs

none	 ornate its made of  several different kinds of wood and iron you know everything about this  sam i open it  travis how do you open it  sam is there a handle  travis yes there is there is a latch  liam this is game of fantasy and imagination so its just going to open and not hurt us at all  sam ill open the latch  travis the door opens it just opens  taliesin what madness is this  liam this is a utopia  travis the door swings open you notice as 
none	 it opens theres a carving in the wood of a large  tower as it swings open it reveals in front of it a small structure about 30 to 50 feet out in  front of you and darkness beyond  taliesin nothing happened when we opened the door  travis no  taliesin are you sure youre doing it right  travis yeah shockingly  laura what was outside of the door  travis as scanlan and trinket are looking through the doorway they see a structure about 30 to 50  feet away from the doorway further into 
none	 another space is just darkness beyond  liam my own bathroom door in whitestone hits me for one point of bludgeoning damage every time i  use it  taliesin its designed for that its a door  liam this door is faulty  laura we go through it i want to walk towards the structure  travis you go through the doorway  sam im going through the doorway first with trinket  travis would everyone like to go through the doorway  taliesin im going to watch everyone else go through the doorway  travis youre going to 
none	 stay behind  taliesin im going to go through once theyve started to go through im going to make sure  everythings good  travis who goes first  sam i will go first  travis scanlan you get to the doorway and the second you start to cross the threshold you feel  the force start to pull you towards the door almost as if someone has removed the stopper from  a bathtub you feel yourself being pulled through i need everyone to make dexterity saving throws  laura all of us  travis all of you  
none	 liam even if we didnt say we were going towards the door  travis yep  liam i knew it was too good to be true  sam i rolled a one  laura i rolled a one  taliesin i rolled a 21  laura lets see what trinket rolls thats cocked trinket rolled 18  travis 18 okay vax  liam vaxildan rolled a 30  travis 30 everyone except for vax and percy are immediately pulled through the threshold  laura what about grog  liam freddie up top  travis thats a seven grog also pulled 
none	 through the doorway  taliesin oh thats right we didnt go through the door  travis vax and percy manage to cling to the side of the threshold  liam fucking dummies right  taliesin this is why you never trust a door  travis you still feel this force pulling you like theres been an atmospheric pull through the  doorway you hear on the other side your comrades getting up seemingly fine  laura what a nice journey that was i really enjoyed that  travis for you two on this side of the door the pull is 
none	 still incredibly strong you can try and  fight it or you can go through  taliesin im curious to hear how this sensation will be narrated  liam yeah id like to wait and also to mull over who is this more painful for you vexahlias  husband and lover or me her oldest friend and twin brother its hard to tell grog can you  enlighten us  travis yes as youre mulling this over you get 12 points of force damage  taliesin and liam thats fine  liam lets feel this out  taliesin i was 
none	 curious what kind of hardware is attaching this door to the wall is it standard  brass brackets triple bracket  travis yeah  taliesin does it have a twoway turn can you describe this  travis its almost as if you saw it for yourself with those descriptions really quite impressive  taliesin can you describe me seeing it for myself  travis yeah its the triple brass tracket theres lumber and stone  taliesin there is lumber and stone  travis iron gold inlay on the door  taliesin thats quite nice  travis yep and a picture 
none	 of a tower  liam while he studies the door im studying percival does he look more rugged and  goodlooking as his hair is blown towards the door or less  travis you know right when you slap someone after youve had too much to drink and their face is  doing the pull thats what his face looks like constantly  taliesin well if youd said that im letting go and im going through the door  travis you let go and you go through the door vax youre the only one still on this side of the 
none	 door  liam okay i do a fivecount one two three four five and then i just go motherfucker and  i grip my own shoulders and dive  travis yeah and you go right through the doorway as well you both fall with a clatter to the  floor and you notice that in front of you is a structure  liam the pentagon  laura what is this oh look at all those carpets do they fly  liam is this heaven  laura is this heaven  travis youre prone percys prone  taliesin i dont think 
none	 i can go prone  travis really  taliesin i dont think i can prone  laura really  taliesin let me doublecheck this i dont think i can  liam can you be pwned  taliesin theres no pwning here  travis you see before you  taliesin yep i cannot be knocked prone  travis nice youre on your feet  laura just vax then  liam i also cannot be knocked prone  travis you see before you a brilliant structure in the shape of a circle its quite massive made  of stone there seems to 
none	 be some sort of architecture about it  sam are we able to see inside like we are right now grog  travis no  sam so we dont know that theres carpets in the individual rooms in there  travis no  liam i can see them though right there  travis just pretend like you dont  laura are those doors or are those windows on the side  travis those are doors you see on each side of the structure there are doors around you you  find yourself in a void black space all around in 
none	 fact you turn around to see the doorway with  which you came has disappeared  laura what are we standing on  taliesin thats really mysterious  travis youre standing on stone but in each direction it just seems darkness after about 20 to  30 feet there is no determinable light source its just youre able to see here  sam im just gonna walk around the fivesided circle and just make sure theres doors on each of  its five sides  laura they look like they have different symbols on them  travis right there is 
none	 in fact doors on each one of the faces one of them appears to be open  liam and is this also permanent marker  travis maybe  liam all right  sam which one is open  travis it appears that the door on this side is open  sam the one with the star on it id like to go investigate that door  travis all right yes so you go over and find this open door and as you look there is a symbol  above the doorway it seems to be the symbol of a star 
none	 and the door is open would you like to  investigate  sam i would like to investigate  travis roll an investigation check  liam grog may i use an action to stand up  sam 24  travis 24 yes you may stand up  liam yes  travis you are facing the wrong way again  liam thatll be my next action to turn around  travis you see before you a wooden and iron door with a handle and it has been seemingly forced  open inside there is a room and from what you can 
none	 see from your vantage point it seems a very  comfortable room you see a rug on the floor a potted plant on the side and what seems to be a  chest at the end of the room  sam no traps that i saw  travis does not appear to be trapped  sam all right ill step into the room  travis you step in  liam seems wise  sam while no one is looking at me i will take out a bit of meat and the poison ive never used  in the game its

none	  travis you are on what seems to be the roof of the room previous and theres a giant tower right  in the middle of all of this at the top of this tower not to size theres a large platform dome  area up here with light radiating out of it  liam guys from my point of view i can see fletchers mill emblazoned at the base of the  tower i just imagined it  laura is that sharpie at the bottom of that pepper mill  travis no nope  sam did he ruin your

none	 handholds  taliesin i ignore them im not going to put my hands or feet in any of those holes  travis it appears the same energy covers that tower and you take eight points of force damage  as percy touches and activates the shield for a second time the lights around you dim and you  feel heat around each of you individually  you are struck with horror as form begins to take shape in front of each of you behind  percy all of a sudden the form of a mind flayer begins to take shape 
none	 behind vax a redskinned  armorclad winged demon appears a cambion right in front of our rogue  sam you looked these up last night you had to look these up  travis in front of vex a pony  laura oh a pony yay  taliesin dont touch it its evil  travis and in front of scanlan materializes to his horror  a fucking trex  laughter  travis a giant roar echoes across the land  liam over a gibbon  taliesin i have been waiting for gibbon versus trex my entire life  travis a trex
