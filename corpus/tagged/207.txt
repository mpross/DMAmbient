you because there have been periods of time in which  youve complained about not having a proper stein or mug to  match the rest of the group we figure  sam ive got a google one  matt google one works /none/ fine but thanks to some of our wondrous illustrious campmates we were with  at burning man they gifted this unto us to gift unto you  as we felt it was fitting and sizeappropriate  sam oh yes yes it makes me look cute  laughter  liam you have to measure that out in a regular cup first and then pour it in  travis you could pour two whole drinks in there and it would be half an inch of liquid  sam wow this things amazing  marisha so thanks postnuclear family  matt well done /none/  travis laughter that is amazing  sam its a hotel ice thing  marisha yeah its technically an ice bucket  sam i want to fill it up right now  laura its hiding your face  matt all righty so to get caught up on what has transpired the party after traveling abroad in  the distant city of vasselheim and the surrounding lands eventually returned to emon their central  hub city where they had their greyskull keep constructed to relax and take in a brief moment  of respite before learning that the briarwoods two individuals /none/ responsible for much darkness and  sadness in the history of percy were coming to court in a week to feast and talk with sovereign  uriel taldorei what are you doing  travis lock it up jeez  sam i poured a whole glass in there and it looks like nothing  matt you got to keep pouring upon hearing of the briarwoods arrival within a week to discuss  political matters and enjoy a feast of course the members of vox machina who are part of the  council in taldorei were invited within that week they made /none/ their various preparations made  the various beard checks made the various beard shavings it happened and made their way to the  central palace at the cloudtop district of emon the briarwoods arrived a feast was put out  however percy went in under an illusion to look like vax over here while vax went invisible  everyone had formal attire on weapons left at the door unarmored dressed for the occasion  sam is that true no armor  matt yeah you guys were all dressed in formal attire  travis we dont even have any weapons  /dung/ sam do i need to subtract things from  travis the recap makes it so much better just lay it out  matt so your weapons are at the door theyre not on you at the moment  laura theyre at the door we left them at the door  matt yeah as part of the checkin process  liam question mine are on me right  matt yeah because you went invisible and you were under the approval of seeker asum  liam you just increased my chances by 2 thank you  laura and percy your weapons are /none/ still on you because you  already had an illusion on you right  matt correct the list is on him his pepperbox bad news would be a bit difficult  for you to bring in here  taliesin diplomacy would work out well though  matt yeah i think so during the feast conversations were had questions were raised and  information was extracted seeker asum had requested to have been met in the foyer by our  rogue here who forgot and then decided to go on his own upstairs following the briarwoods to the  second floor /none/ where their guest room was set he distracted one of the guards with his serpent  belt knocked out the other entered the room and found himself face to face  with the briarwoods themselves  liam that did not lead to further hallway in fact that just led to a bedroom  it ended right there  matt yeah it went right into their guest room so after a brief discussion a little bit of  awkwardness you attempted to leave but were placed in a holding pattern by a hold person  spell and had the two briarwoods /none/ come up to you whisper in your ear that you had nothing to worry  about you look delicious  sam yeah theres nothing to worry about  liam theyre kind of hot  laura right i mean they are hot right so at least theres that  travis what are we doing while this is happening  matt you guys are just now leaving the feast hall at this period of time  orion where are we entering to  matt a large foyer area theres the main foyer of the palace that splits off to two smaller  /none/ meeting chambers and the chamber to the right is what leads to the grand hall thats where you  guys were feasting so youre making your way into this  taliesin hasum  matt asum seeker asum yes  taliesin seeker asum is he around do we see him anywhere  matt no  sam tell me this dm when my invisibility spell is broken am i alerted do i know that  do i sense it  matt the spell itself would dissipate as it is a concentration spell it would be a oh spells  gone however before /dung/ we get to you guys we have more immediate business to attend to  liam lets play matt lets play  matt vax your muscles lock in place sweat beginning to bead down the front of your forehead  the realization of the immediate danger you put yourself in washing over you you can see across  the way in the dark candlelit area of the room by the canopy bed is lady delilah briarwood hand  still out smiling at you immediately to your left shoulder is lord sylas briarwood who has  leaned in hes actually pulling you /none/ away from the door now youre skidding across the ground  dragging sound as he shifts you your legs unable to actually move as he pulls you forward  the lord whispers in your ear you are a curious one though not quite gifted with the silver  tongue foolhardiness is not becoming of a guest of the briarwoods for a moment theres this  pause this tension the silence and delilah lady briarwood puts her hand out further and  says yet my love we are not here to make enemies nor raise suspicion we are merely  protecting /none/ ourselves from intrusion isnt that right as she looks at you and looks immediately  to your right where you can feel the general presence of lord briarwood i need you to go ahead  and make another wisdom saving throw  sam first roll not an unimportant one  orion not at all  sam first roll of the night could kill liam  laura no thats good  liam thats 18  travis what was that how much  liam im frozen  laura 18 he said  matt you feel your muscles lax and the sweat that /none/ is still brimming across your face you feel  for the first time in these moments that seem to stretch on forever you have control of your body  though you do feel the hand of lord briarwood right on your shoulder who as you become  conscious of the fact that you are in control of your physical form his voice comes very heavily  the bass kicking into your left ear indeed we do require allies i would have you prove  friendship and as he takes and moves the shoulder away you find your torso moving towards /none/  him you lock eyes with him and he has this knowing grin his lids taut slightly with this  condescending sense of knowing i need you to go ahead and make another wisdom saving throw this  is technically a charm effect and you being a halfelf you do  i believe get advantage on those  liam that is a 21  matt 21 you feel an extension of the sheer unnatural force of charisma that attempts to  penetrate beyond the usual slippery mind that vax holds to such a high esteem however you manage  to /none/ resist it and feel it wash over you as the slight tingling vanishes and the effect has left  you unaffected by whatever he was attempting to try  sam ooh what was he trying who knows  matt theres a brief moment as he looks you over  liam what do you need  marisha yes thats so smart  matt there now be a good boy looks over i need you to make a deception check  liam deception check okay im using luck to go again  matt now you used a couple luck points last time /none/  liam yeah i used one i did a lot last game but we were over multiple days i used one this day  im about to use my second gagging noise okay this is deception  matt deception yes  liam ooh thats not as great thats a 15  matt 15 okay gives you a look very well apparently the help was not very helpful at  which point you hear this fast knock at the door and you hear a voice go  are you all right is everyone all right  behind the door  at /none/ which point lady briarwood just does this with her finger and the door swings open creak on  its own the guard that ran after your belt is standing there holding the groggy just slightly  coming to second guard that you knocked out and as he pulls him towards the door he looks over  and sees this and he goes drops him and goes for his weapon and lord briarwood puts his hand  up and goes do not worry were just having a conversation close the door and get him up  yes not a worry sir /none/ and he closes the door and you hear the scuffling behind the wood of him  adjusting and waking up the guard who you had clobbered in the side of the head getting him to  consciousness so theyre both just looking you over lord briarwoods just walking back and  forth keeping a very keen eye he walks between you and the door as you stand there almost like  hes waiting for a reaction of some kind for you to initiate something  liam thank you so much thank you so much what can i do to help /none/ im pretty meager a servant but  anything you need whatever you need gosh you guys are goodlooking  laughter  liam it isnt that is it  matt you hear a throaty chuckle from lady briarwood across the way chuckles no but what  do you think my love lord briarwood comes up from behind his hands on the back of your  shoulder and says like we said you havent the gift of the silver tongue but i applaud your effort  liam well my mom and dad said im a real good speaker they paid for a /none/ tutor to teach me how to  talk and its worked out really well for me in my life so if you need an ambassador or a butler  who talks i could do that for you  matt lady briarwood at this point steps a couple steps closer shes still about 15 feet from you  hes right behind you right between you and the door she steps forward and looks over at her  husband again and goes what do you think can we trust him and lord briarwood leans forward  and you can feel his chin /none/ peeking into your peripheral vision im afraid not it seems  liam well heres the thing you need to know about uriel and i take a step back  matt into him  liam no away  matt hes between you and the door  liam well does he hold me if i turn well i just said that right  heres the thing about uriel  matt as you go to move away his arms that are on your shoulder tighten flex  and hold you in place  liam oh you dont want to know okay ill just /none/ save that for later  sam roll for coy  liam roll for what matt  matt since i dont know what youre going to say im going to say persuasion for this because i  dont know if its a deception or not  travis is the power out of the dms hands for a moment  liam oh im going to use my last luck of the day  travis the last one  liam last luck of the day  laura oh my god  liam okay this is persuasion thats 17  travis that was a /none/ big die  liam you could give me a never mind  matt you want an inspiration  liam huh no  matt laughs what are you asking for what are you begging from the dm  liam yeah no thats why i said never mind  travis is it begging or is it praying at this point  matt no ill give inspiration when youve goddamn earned it as you say that looking at them  with this coy look of information about uriel they both chuckle in unison chuckles shall we  and she gives a nod and /none/ goes i think we shall  liam can i roll for initiative  matt were now rolling for initiative  marisha fuck  travis does he have an earring  liam yes  matt so here you are right there lord briarwood is behind you lady briarwood is over  here by the edge of the bed these are the two windows this is the layout of the room here as  far as you are aware there are two guards outside the door currently  liam my initiative can only be described as fecal  matt oh no  /none/ laura it wasnt a one  liam wasnt a one  matt one adjacent is what youre telling me  liam six it was six it comes close  orion i thought you were out of there man  matt all right so for this delilah steps forward and you can see theres a slight flash of  bluishpurple arcane energy in her eyes and her fingers coalesce around as she does she draws  her fingers up and you feel this sudden cold pressure around your body i need to pull out my  spells i dont know what /none/ im doing here  liam should i check my iphone too  laura hes pulling up his spells  taliesin he hasnt had time to memorize all the ways hes going to fuck with you there are that  many ways  matt all right so i need you to go ahead and make a constitution saving throw vax  liam 19  matt 19 all right so as she does this you feel all the flesh on your torso and around the neck  part of your body all of a sudden begin to dry and crack as if /none/ your life force itself is beginning to  wither and be drawn out its the equivalent of a plant drying out and dying very fast but its  your flesh instead you go ahead and take  marisha sounds like blight or something  matt you take 21 points of necrotic damage and shes going to go ahead and step this way after  that she backs up and grabs the edge of the post at the side of the bed and looks at you with this  grin at that point as you tense from the pain sylas immediately /none/ whips to one side and with an  unarmed claw attack a giant fist is going to hit you on the side of your torso that is going to be  a 21 to hit  liam that hits  matt all right you take eight points of bludgeoning damage as his fist socks you on the  inside of your chest area hitting the sternum and you feel like a slight pain crack sound as it hits  and impacts against the leather as you pull forward with unnatural speed whoosh the hands  are back on your shoulder /none/ and you hear this little voice say bon appetit that is going to be a 25  to hit all right okay you take six points of piercing damage as suddenly you feel two extremely  sharp warm prongs jut into the side of your neck and that same cold sensation you felt across your  torso all of a sudden begins to pull from the neck and you feel as if the very warm blood around your  throat begins to drain from it you take an additional 12 points of necrotic damage and your  maximum hit points /none/ are currently reduced by 12  marisha oh ho theyre sucking the life out of you  matt its your turn  liam hes holding me right  matt actually this will be part of his unarmed attack no he does not have you grappled  currently hes over the shoulders  liam okay as a bonus action im going to use rogues cunning action to disengage which means  nobody can swipe at me if i run okay  marisha whispering jenga  liam theres a window last week you said there was a window to the courtyard  /none/ matt there are two windows on each side of the room there  liam okay im running straight at the window and as i run yeah past them and i dont go  anywhere near her and im using dash and im leaping out the window and saying jenga  travis jenga  matt window breaking as you run past you can see theres this moment where its almost like  they are letting it happen there is no momentary aggression or frustration to this as you dart and  crashing out the window falling from the second story go /town/ ahead and make an acrobatics check  liam that is a 32  matt okay  liam do i even stop running  matt chuckles you hit the ground with a tumble and you get up and you continue to move forward  so at this point youve pushed into the courtyard now you can see the cobblestone road that  surrounds the outskirts of the palace there are a few bits of light and you can see there is the  carriage they came in horses still attached and the younger man who led them inside who was  /none/ driving the coach is napping on the front who is now looking over spooked at the sound of  shattering glass as it clatters onto the ground around you and that ends your turn everyone else  you hear jenga whispered through those of you who have the earrings on  sam hes in trouble lets go  marisha whats going on  taliesin now we hear shattering glass dont we  matt not from this part of the palace youre too far away  laura i start running towards the door to grab weapons and im saying into my /none/ ear where are  you whats going on  sam im by the bartender saying i ordered a large please can i have a slightly larger one  please what oh oh shit  marisha im going to go eagle and i start scouting the halls looking for him  taliesin im running with them towards the doors  liam i dont know am i able to talk further  matt thats about as much as you got out this combat round because it was a very quick series  it took all your effort to even get out of /none/ that situation  travis she and i are booking it for the door  matt so you guys go forward you run towards the front and the weapons are being held in this storage  area off to the side that is used for storing weaponry and armor for people who arrive and  shouldnt be wearing them in very social events so you guys head that way  youre getting a big drink  marisha im heading to wherever i saw the briarwoods taking off whenever they were leaving  taliesin actually did you turn into an eagle can /none/ you carry me  marisha no youre big i can take the gnomes  taliesin thats fine i need to get my gun anyway  matt you burst through the hall and head up the way as you do you can see some of the other  servants glance around suddenly  marisha i poop on one of them as i go over  matt as you youre gliding up the staircase and onto the second floor there are two servants one  darts out of the way  marisha its one of the briarwoods servants right oh no i /none/ want to save it for if i fly over  one of the briarwoods never mind its fine  matt well let it go so as you coast up releasing your avian payload on the stairs you  can see looking jarred and confused a human woman brown hair freckles mousylooking servant  looks up and reaches up as you spatter the side of her shoulder  marisha caws thats me saying sorry  orion i see whats going on youre flying i cast fly on myself i follow suit behind her and  as im passing by the person /none/ she shat on i cast prestidigitation on her sorry about that  matt okay the keyleth spatter vanishes through arcane means however the servant begins to give  chase up the stairs after you guys not angrily just following to see where the action is going  all right you head over to meet up with them to grab your weaponry although your weapon was probably on you  taliesin bad news  matt so you go ahead and grab bad news and pull it off the side thats your guys action now so  as you are out front /none/ lady briarwood is going to right at the window looks down for a second and  i need you to make another wisdom saving throw  liam thats a 13  matt 13 so as you get up and you say jenga a familiar feel comes over you as your muscles once  again lock into place and you fall over from the momentum of the run going facedown into the cold  dewcovered grass in this courtyard area unable to move  liam muffled fucking bitch  matt in a similar dash fashion and leaping out of the broken /none/ window that you left lord briarwood  impact onto the ground next to you threepoint landing stands up over you with this grin that  will be his turn though at this point in time one of the bookcases you hear this sound real  fast this sound of wood being slammed open and a surprised noise thats all you hear from your perspective  in the distance all right so as you guys get your weapons you begin going where  laura i guess running towards the briarwoods room  matt where you saw them leave you head up /none/ the stairway following behind where you saw  keyleth and tiberius rush off to are you following the rest of them  sam yeah i put my mug down and i start little leg waddling towards them as i go im going to  send a message i use message to whos the guy who likes us  liam my name is vax  sam no not him sylas no not sylas seeker asum  matt seeker asum with message i believe the person has to be within visual range wait no  you can cast through solid objects if /none/ youre familiar with the target and nobody on the  barrier its 120 foot though you dont know how far he is you could give it a shot  sam okay i say somethings gone awry we may need you right away  matt the message is delivered out into the space hopefully it found its recipient  laura as im running towards the briarwoods room i start shouting uriel and grab a servant  and say go find uriel tell him theres enemies within the gates in the castle now  matt yes lady vex right away runs off /none/ you guys coast up the stairs right as you reach the  top of the hallway over here you can see there are two guards that are  currently standing at the door  travis i stay at the front door  marisha is the door open  matt the door is currently closed but youre in eagle form so youre going to be doing like  eagles do ill say youre about there because you were a little bit ahead of them those are the  two guards right there at this point now as this is happening  /none/ i need you guys to go ahead and roll initiative  marisha thats okay thanks percy ten  orion 17  matt and keyleth keyleth you got ten you said  marisha yes  matt okay so after that current circumstance that brings us as theyre rushing up you would  be finishing off the last round so you  can make another wisdom check  liam i failed it  matt okay you can just see the little bit of moonlight up in the sky it is this ominous image  of not knowing if your friends are coming /none/ not knowing whats happening all you know is you  cannot move your physical form and looming over you is lord briarwood standing and beginning to  move in to kneel that will end your turn all right that brings us to the top of the round  this will bring us to lady delilah who is now going to step out of the glass leap down try to  catch herself and falls flat on her ass smacks down grunts gets herself up from the ground  yeah she has to use the rest of her movement getting back /none/ up from prone at that point shes  right there but you see now in the window above her a small humanoid figure a familiar one that  was waiting for you earlier in the foyer who apparently was hiding inside one of the dressers  inside the room  laura seeker  matt hes there lady briarwood is going to take the rest of her turn she has one action left  with this she looks over to you and says when we mark a target he does not escape im afraid  im going to see what this /none/ does all right i need you to make another constitution saving throw  liam nine  laura start rolling different dice  liam the universe is random and doesnt care about you and me  marisha life lessons by critical role  sam stay in school kids  matt you take 34 points of necrotic damage  liam im unconscious i havent been knocked out in ages  matt you go unconscious then when it comes back to your next turn you have to make a death saving  throw if you fail three  liam right so its only /none/ if it exceeds my hit point maximum that im killed outright so im  unconscious  matt you are unconscious  liam hey guys im unconscious  marisha so that means he never got his im right here message out  matt nope  laura but we know hes in the room thats where were all heading  marisha well hes not in the room hes in the front yard at this point so we are heading to  the room  liam wait as that happens and as my consciousness fades away i dont say anything  but heres /none/ what i think in a splitsecond i think of my friends that i have spent so much time with  i think of keyleth beautiful walking under the trees i think of my twin sister as a young girl  folding up linens with our mother i think of my sister as an adolescent in lessons smarter than  me i think of the woman she grew into hiking over many many many miles together my best  friend my best friend vexahlia and before i can think no more i say a prayer to sarenrae to  watch over /none/ my friends and keep them safe  matt go ahead and make a wisdom saving throw  liam eight  matt with that thought cast out the darkness swallows your vision and unconsciousness takes you  into the cold wet grass on the floor of the courtyard surrounding the palace a small shiver  runs down your spine vex a feeling you havent felt before a feeling of sudden and immediate  sourceless dread and in that instant you know that there is almost no time  laura can i use hunters mark and sense where lady briarwood is at /none/ that moment  matt yeah she is actually at this point beyond the palace walls you can sense and knowing the  palace walls you were expecting a second floor its that direction but just outside the walls of  the palace and you guys just got your weapons  laura i take off running in that direction  matt im going to have people who havent rolled initiative yet go ahead and roll initiative so i  can put you on the timing chart here  grog  travis 17  matt 17 nice  sam 17  matt /none/ 17 look at you guys  taliesin 16  laura i hadnt rolled actually for that i hadnt rolled initiative yet 18  matt you guys are coming up into the hallway at this point lets see all right vex and grog  you rush out into the courtyard area making your way out of the front some of the guards can see  you dart out and they go to stop you but they see you going where theyre going they recognize you  and let you pass so that will be for scanlan grog and vexahlia your turn /none/ is making your way  around the outside using a full run action you havent crested the outside of the palace yet you  dont see anything but you are starting to make your way around the corner  laura can i use my earring during that i tell keyleth and tiberius that i think they are outside  the palace walls  orion copy that  sam did i hear that  matt do you have your ear pieces on then yeah you would  sam then i dont run i dimension door outside of the palace wall  /none/ matt okay go ahead and make an intelligence check roll a d20 and add your intelligence  modifier  sam not good oh wait  travis seeing how fast shes running i go into a rage  sam oh wait it says i have advantage on intelligence saving throws this is not a saving  throw then no eight  matt eight so you manage to dimension door  sam into an outhouse  matt as opposed to being directly outside because you havent seen this part of the palace  youre not really 100 visual range you havent visited /none/ this side you end up trying to come over  in this area you end up appearing right up here inside the room looking at the window and you can  see down suddenly you look about this room to the left of you is seeker asum who doesnt even  notice you are there he is currently putting away a crossbow looking out the glass window you can  see down with the little bit of light thats in the courtyard you see lord sylas briarwood  looming over what looks to be the currently unconscious body of vaxildan /dung/  marisha thats right its dark outside  matt yes it is bringing us to this point now thats your guys turn tiberius youre up  orion does anyone have eyes on vax anyone  sam i do do i  laura yeah you do  sam i think i do  orion where are you scanlan  sam inside a room i dont know where i am its a nicelooking room  orion i assume youre in their chambers ill be right there fireball to those guys right there  explosion sound  matt right there all right go /none/ ahead and roll damage yeah they did not  make their saving throws  orion i wanted to say real quick right before that i got to my decanter of water and i start  charging it and then i do fireball  matt so roll your damage on that  orion how much is that  taliesin will that also widen up the hole into that room  marisha well see i guess  sam or you could make a wall of fire  orion how much is that 35  matt 35 okay one of them gets blasted /none/ and thrown almost off his feet and pushed back from  the sheer force five foot in that direction the one thats this side of the doorway who was already  at one hit point barely brought from already being knocked unconscious by vax you hear a  scream and is turned to ash his charred armor left clattering across the ground  orion what about the door  matt both doors are blown open from the force of the explosion a large portion of the room is  currently singed with black whats your fly speed  orion 30 /none/ feet  matt thats as far as you can get  orion can that dude see me from where i am  matt he can currently see you yeah  orion good i turn to him and im like you better get the hell out of my way  and thats my turn  matt okay make an intimidation check  liam laura and travis yeah  orion 23  matt from what you can see the helmet itself guards part of the face but you can see from the  charred slightly angered gritting expression on his mouth as /none/ he looks at you as you shout that  the grittiness goes away the jaw opens slack and takes two instinctual steps back into the hallway  does not appear to be interested in threatening what just blew his friend into ashes  travis cremated him  matt from behind you as youre flying over you see this servant come rushing up the female one  that you saw earlier on the stairway rushing forward seemingly with an intense look of what  went from curiosity to now engrossed in this current circumstance kit do you want to go ahead /none/  and take your place  sam wait whats going on what do we see  orion this is where she comes in  liam you can sit right here  marisha oh im really sorry i pooped on you i didnt know i was shitting on you  orion i cleaned you up dont worry  laura can i ask a question trinket i didnt say i left him at home did he wait outside of the  palace during the formal dinner  matt trinket would not be at the dinner per se  laura but he would /none/ have stayed outside at the palace right  matt trinket would probably be kept somewhere near the stables where the people can watch over  your animals  liam he eats at the table with us all the time  matt not in the middle of the grand hall of the palace of taldorei sorry  liam she taught him to sit in a chair  matt as you rush in you see this giant fireball blast through the middle of the hallway two of  the guards are sent off to the side theres this hurried look and this /none/ shout youve seen these  individuals throughout the palace before and theyre part of the council youve always kept a  distance from them youre a servant of the palace you want to keep up appearances for many  reasons however theres this rush of energy and this general sense of dread in this corner of the  palace and for the most part judging by this you didnt like the briarwoods when they arrived  and you think things are going wrong here what are you going to do with your turn  kit can i join in the /none/ fray  matt youre right over here in the hallway its hard to see from this perspective here but youre  right over here  kit okay  sam dm who is this person whos just joined us for the audience  matt this is kit buss whos our official artist for critical role  cheering  matt in from the uk to join us for one session of awesomeness  orion thats the united kingdom  taliesin where the real accents come from  sam shes going to be doing the worst american accent possible  liam whats going /none/ on around here  matt youre over here theres this guard here and these doorways are blown open and seems to be  where all the energys going you have a good sense for the flow of energy and emotional  tension and right now everything is pushing in that direction  kit okay can i use my turn to dash to get through the doors  matt thatll get you right there you can just look past the doors and theyre blown open  thatll be your turn there as you glance inside you can see the gnome member /none/ of vox machina is  there currently at the edge of one window the left window is shattered on this side seeker  asum another part of the council is right at that he looks over his shoulder looks at you and  goes shoo you see him look like what are you doing no go go stupid servant thats your  turn all right that brings us to percy  taliesin where am i  matt you were rushing outside with them or rushing up the stairs  taliesin rushing outside with them  matt okay youll just catch /none/ up with them theyre on the outskirts just cresting around the  side of the palace here all right  taliesin am i just there or am i off the map  matt youre in theory off the map on this side ill get to that shortly youre rushing as fast  as you can you exited the front of the palace and spent your whole turn rushing as fast as you can  around the side its a long distance putting all your energy into it  taliesin i have a very long range  matt you have no /none/ visual unfortunately that brings us to sylas  travis that dick  matt all right no sorry before sylas is the seeker seeker asum  laura seeker awesome  matt asum hes pretty awesome hes going to leap down here hes going to make his own  acrobatics check which he does with flying colors because rangers are cool like that lands  immediately and angrily rushes forward going no and attempts to feint into an attack and  lord briarwood puts up his hand to attempt to deflect with preternatural speed just whoosh out  of the way asum /none/ instead reaches down to grab the unconscious body of vax and is going to  attempt to move you away from here sylas does get an attack of opportunity against you  thats a 16  liam do i make a death saving throw  matt whats your armor class  liam 17  matt 17 unconscious ill say theres no dex bonus to that because you cant move out of the  way so that would be 15 im sorry 12 it hits you i rolled for that you immediately take a  death saving throw instantaneously you failed /none/ one now it is sylass turn that was seeker  asum now its  laura seekers turn and sylas got to take a turn  matt he got a free attack because he moved out of range to try to hit him rushes up to join the  fray there hes going to look towards seeker asum and say this quarrel is not with you asum  looks over his shoulder asum relaxes his grip on vaxs body and stands at attention and you hear  him say my apologies i did not mean to meddle he seems to be /none/ stepping out of the fray  travis seeker asum is  matt yes thats a charm action to get him out of that that will be sylas turn  that brings us to keyleth  marisha im going to go double my speed my fly speed is 80 feet right now im going to head  towards and pick up scanlan  matt make a general dexterity check youre flying in very tight quarters as a giant eagle  flowing through  marisha dexterity saving throw you said as my eagle form right 12  matt 12 okay thats fine /none/ you clip a wing it hurts and you wince at the impact but you manage  to make your way in there as you come down you grab scanlan but theres not a lot of room here  to get much lift or air so youre now clutching your gnome  sam do i get a save  matt do you not want to be grabbed by her  sam well i dont know shes there i dont know whats grabbing me  marisha youve seen me turn into an eagle  sam im not even looking at you  /none/ matt make an insight check  sam insight check okay not good five  matt five okay you see this giant eagle come screeching into the room talons out and starts  coming at you with talons be mindful of that its technically now a grapple contest so go  ahead and make an athletics check  marisha an athletics check with my eagle is that dex or strength  matt it would be strength  marisha 19  matt 19 go ahead and make an acrobatics check to avoid it or athletics athletics or acrobatics  your choice  /none/ sam 15  matt 15 as much as you try and fight the eagle grabs you and your tiny gnome form is grasped in  its claws oh woe is this evening  sam first i got a small drink and now this  matt all right that finishes keyleths turn i need you to make a second death saving throw  liam i succeeded  matt okay so you stabilize  liam wait im at one  matt you didnt die sorry my apologies vex you swing around the corner just getting to the  outskirts  laura right /none/ as i get outside i would whistle but vex can whistle and she whistles for  trinket  matt youre not sure where trinket is  laura no but i whistle for him he knows to listen for it  matt do you want to get as close as possible to the fray  laura yes  matt id say as you turn the corner that will get you about there and you can see now there is  seeker asum and lord briarwood both standing over what looks to be a small cluster of cloth the  source of /none/ the dread  laura i scream can i attack  matt you can yeah  laura okay if i did something that did five feet ten feet ive got to look at this yeah  ten feet if i hit lady briarwood would that hit my brother or would that just hit bastard  briarwood  matt no that would just hit her oh within ten feet it would hit seeker and sylas yeah  laura fuck it im doing it lightning arrow right at her face  matt okay go for it roll for it  sam dont miss /none/  laura well thats wedged  travis yeah its a weirdo roll  laura natural 20  matt the fury pumps through your veins in an attempt at vengeance at what appears to be your  twin brother at deaths door you pull the arrow from the back of your quiver as you feel the  energy gather from the atmosphere around you while the energy itself is a blue crackling  energy you see it as bright vibrant crimson red you release it with a scream towards lady  briarwood go ahead and roll damage on that  laura /none/ what do i do times two  matt yes times two  laura so it was 32 damage on her and then everybody within ten feet has to make a dex save  matt all right he doesnt get one  laura not him hes not in it and i hunters marked her  matt right so it does additional damage  laura fuck one  matt one okay  marisha every little bit counts  matt the lightning hits her it shocks her and you see the pain come through but for the sheer  force that should have /none/ been it seems almost like it wasnt as impactful as it should have been  however lord briarwood and seeker asum both fail so they both take the additional damage  laura oh good then 2d8 for them nine and then times two because it was critical 18  matt sure ill allow it  liam haggling  laura and i get another attack though yes okay then im going to attack her through my  blazing bowstring  natural 20 again  cheering  laura inspired by my brother  matt youve certainly invoked the fury tonight all right /none/ go ahead  liam she loves me  matt against lady briarwood to follow up on that  laura yes of course it is okay eight plus seven is 15 plus two for bracers so thats 17  times two is 34  sam hunters mark  laura plus hunters mark damage which is another fucking six 38 damage no no it is 40 damage  matt well no shes not concentrating because hes unconscious i was saving for the hold person  spell but shes not concentrating on that currently  laura shes on fire  matt she is /none/ actually lit on fire  laura i should say what the blazing bowstring does huh an additional d10 of damage for that  would that have been part of the part that was multiplied by two  matt no  laura another six for that  liam does seeker asum get a save now that hes been hit to shake that charm  matt it has to be damage from the allies of the person who charmed them so no you guys are  currently considered a threat to him all right so that ends your turn that brings us /none/ to delilah  delilah whos now on fire laura the blazing bowstring does that ignite her does she take  continuous fire damage or is that just onetime fire damage no its an additional 1d10 once she  shrugs off the flames i remember that angrily  kit at least you messed up her dress  laura yeah fuck that dress  matt as the electrical energy and the flames dissipate she puts her hands out like this and  she looks at you for a second and she extends one cruel finger towards you with a look of intense /none/  hatred i need you to make a constitution save  laura okay  matt i dont know if she has to aim it or not let me check nope i need you to make a  constitution saving throw  laura okay yeah okay cool 15 no wait 17  matt 17 thats not enough unfortunately  sam oh man thats a lot of rolling  liam carry the three  matt you take 66 points of necrotic damage as a sickly beam of black energy streaks out from her  finger plows into your torso and you feel /none/ as if your soul is temporarily pulled from a portion of  your body for a second there your eyes glance past the threshold of death and you manage to  pull yourself back in the cold resonates through the rest of your body and all of a sudden the  temperature outside which was already pretty chilly feels freezing cold brush with the finger  of death all right she is going to move over towards sylas right here getting into a  protective standpoint glancing down at the unconscious body of vax that brings us to we  /none/ have grog tiberius and scanlan  sam im going first fucking shit i know shes got me in her fucking claws  matt youve figured this out now after this whole yelps keyleth of course  sam can i still see through the window  matt you can see through the window right there yeah its hard at this point  sam okay ill use my bonus action first to cast healing word on vax singing oh that vax elf  matt whats the range on healing word  marisha 30 feet  matt he is not close enough to /none/ reach youll have to move first  laura then maybe you dont want to go first  marisha i can take you over there  sam would i know that  matt you would know the range of it youd be like ugh hes too far  travis you can move first cant you  sam i cant move shes holding me  laura you can wait  marisha im trying to give you a fast way down motherfucker  sam i know i guess ill hold my turn  matt okay all right tiberius  orion okay move me /none/ an additional 30 feet because my flight is 60 feet  so that was from the last turn  matt okay 60 feet flying speed good to know  orion lets swoop in that room another 60 feet how far can i go can i go all the way down  matt thats as far as you can get right there  orion crap balls can i see anything i cant see anything outside  matt thats the 60 feet for your movement  orion im still flying so can i see  matt right from an elevated standpoint you /none/ would probably just barely be able to see the edge  of lord briarwood down there below he would have threequarters cover but you can see him  orion i cant see vax  matt no not from the angle of the window  orion i charge my decanter thats my turn  matt okay all right you can use your action to move if you want to get closer to the window  orion oh shit yeah can i do that  matt or you could go outside if you wanted to  orion then i cant do anything /none/ else after that right  matt this would be the end of your turn regardless  orion okay then get me right where i can see vax  matt right there  orion actually skootch me one over i can still see him from right there yeah  matt yeah you can see him there cool so youre floating in the air currently looking through  the cracked window at the cluster of mayhem thats below that ends tiberiuss turn grog  travis raging i see vex take off so fast i try and catch up to her and see /none/ whats freaking her  out so much my speed is 50  sam wait no healing word has a 60 feet range you said 30  travis youre after me its okay  matt its all happening simultaneously  travis i take the firebrand warhammer with the chain of returning attached to it i activate it  and i throw it at lady delilah  matt okay whats the range on it  travis it doesnt have a distance it has a dc to pull it back  matt heres what well do its the warhammer or war pick  /none/ travis yeah the warhammer but the chain of returning doesnt have a distance  matt i know its the distance of the weapon is what it is  travis okay  matt looking it up right now for you  taliesin what did we do before iphones  travis how is it 150120  laura yeah because you used it when we were fighting that manta ray  matt i dont have a players handbook if somebody could look up the  equipment section right now  marisha what are you looking for  matt excuse the sound change here /none/ as i have to move the mic there we go i got it there is a  range on thrown weapons unfortunately  taliesin does it count as a mace handaxe  matt warhammer this one is not considered an actual normally thrown weapon so i would give it  the same distance of a handaxe which is 60foot max but you would be at disadvantage on the  throw anyway pretty heavy disadvantage on this so well give it a shot  travis that doesnt even make 60 feet though does it  matt no as you lob  /none/ travis if i know how long it is can i do something else instead of throwing it if id  known the distance  matt yeah if you know the distance then ill say sure  travis can i try for intimidating presence  matt sure  travis theres a dc saving throw  matt against her  travis yeah  matt okay she glances over at you as you come running around the corner this giant engine of  muscle and death you growl at her screaming  travis roars no  matt whats the dc on it  /none/ travis 13  matt 13 she glances over at you and you see her head turn to the side with a curious chuckle  travis so low god  matt yeah sorry  marisha bring it back to sam  matt all right kit youre up oh thats right youre doing your turn continue  sam will 60 feet hit him  matt yes it would  sam okay then i will heal vax singing oh that vax elf getting bit by vampires and his  skins turning pale and white but dont worry because around the corner here comes /none/ scanlan  everythings going to be all right  liam i feel like im going insane  matt all right so roll for how much you heal him  sam even though thats a bonus action im going to do it as a 5thlevel spell  matt its an additional 1d4 for each so it would be 5d4 plus five  sam and i roll it  matt yes you do  sam okay well then give me a bunch of d4s  matt kit youre on deck so imagine what youre going to do next  sam i need /none/ one more great okay whoa what the hell is that one ah shit what are these i can  never add d4  orion 12 plus  matt five so you heal 17 hit points from the darkness  sam wait is it plus five or is it plus five five five  matt no its plus five consciousness comes to you breath comes into your chest and you can  feel the cold wet grass against the left side of your face your vision begins to clarify for a  second and you look up over you you can /none/ see immediately to the right of you both lord and lady  briarwood standing over you looking down with one half of their gaze the other  paying attention to  liam theyre looking at me  matt theyre looking down at you and glancing at this slowly encroaching circle of assailants that  was your bonus action  sam that was my bonus action as my action action oh man this is stupid i lift my hand  cone of clarity and i sing to lady delilah singing hey there delilah wont you listen to  me because im /none/ about to cast a spell on you ooh oh speaking okay so im going to use  suggestion on her this is so stupid  matt so whats the dc on that  sam well its 19  matt with that okay good to know what are you suggesting to her  sam im suggesting that she has an unquenchable urge to make out with her husband  matt all right and what saving throw is it is it a wisdom saving throw  sam it is wisdom  matt wisdom okay good to know rolled an 18 she has /none/ advantage on it anyway all right yeah  she rolled a natural 18 plus her wisdom bonus of two that puts her at a 20 she just crested over  it you can see she glances up for a second at you the presence of the actual shouting and the  suggestion echoing through the glass and out the other broken window she looks up and you see  parts of the shards of the glass are actually shaking from your singing the harmonic resonance  of the glass catching your  liam she doesnt feel even a little bit /none/ horny  matt you gather that probably at all given points of time she probably enjoys being close to  her husband but not overcome with an uncontrollable urge  sam she has a headache  matt right all right so that ends scanlan kit  kit okay am i within 120 feet of either of the briarwoods  matt you are but theyre not currently in visual range because theyre outside and down below so  if you want to try and move over this way you can try to get a visual  kit am i able to /none/ move somewhere where i can see them  matt you would have to leap up onto the edge of the canopy bed you can just see them past the  broken window down into the courtyard there as tiberius the dragonborn you saw coast through is  hovering in the air about five feet above you  kit i would like to  oh theres lots of excitement going on isnt there i would like to  use crown of madness if i may  sam wait i thought she was just a common guard  laura servant  kit /none/ i would like to use crown of madness on lord briarwood  matt all righty what is the dc on the spell  kit my dc would be eight plus my spellcasting modifier  matt it should be at the very top of your spell sheet  kit okay 17  matt 17 all right against lord briarwood chuckles even with his plus seven  laura yay  taliesin oh my god is something actually going to work  matt he is going to use his legendary resistance to succeed the saving throw so as you do that  you /none/ see the magical energy form around his head and this crown of darkened arcane energy forms and  begins to clasp around and he looks up for a second and shrugs his hair like that and it  crash dissipates and you can see for a brief second his vision come up and find your gaze  marisha but matt shes our guest  matt i understand as it was a concentration spell also the illusion that you currently were  holding fades away what was once the demure mousylooking human guest suddenly appears as a  pale white tiefling /none/ currently now existing at the edge of the bed her image shimmers and  disappears as you see her standing before you on her hoofed legs holding what was previously a  nonvisible staff in one hand  orion and im right above her  matt you are right above her yeah  orion i go ooh nice horns  matt looking over your shoulder youre a little bit in front of her but yeah you see her all  right so that will be your turn there  laura our friend is in mortal danger right now you maybe /none/ wouldnt want to hit on somebody at  that moment  kit i would have to agree  matt percy following suit you begin to move around the corner to the others you are now  within visual range of both briarwoods at a far distance though too far for the pepperbox no  its range is 150 so yeah  taliesin pepperbox range is 150 but the bad news range is disgusting  matt nah theyre within range for both  taliesin so ill start with bad news  marisha nothing travels faster  taliesin sighs all right first /none/ shot  matt against who  taliesin yelling sylas  travis yes i got little goosebumps from that  taliesin thats a 30 to hit  matt yeah thatll hit  travis rock his shit  taliesin sighs this is about to feel so good  travis decleat this motherfucker  marisha these are the worst people weve ever faced  taliesin i hate them i hate them so much wheres my other d12s  marisha d12s 12 12 away  taliesin thats 17 points of damage  matt okay the first shot as you gunshot the shot echoing out /dung/ across the night sky of emon  lord briarwood who is currently staring down at you as you come to consciousness and you can see  under his breath he says oh theres no way out tonight friend and begins to lean forward  before impact the back of his shoulder is wracked by a sudden impact you see dark material  just spray spatter out with some sort of dark crimson and he grunts looks over his shoulder  with anger and you can see at that point glistening across the moonlight the sharpened  fangs visible at the /none/ edge of his mouth as he looks over  taliesin is he looking at me okay good im taking another aimed shot at his face  matt okay so you use your second attack to reload  taliesin third shot aimed shot at the face while he was turning around  liam as he reloaded weakly behind him i go hi percy  taliesin thats 24 to hit  matt 24 to hit will hit  sam skadoosh  taliesin laughs thats 28 points of damage and he has disadvantage on all attacks for this  round  marisha yes /none/  matt okay that was using the arm shot good so as he turns around and glares at you theres like  a moment of clarity and you can feel that familiar stare that horrible glare and the  cowardice in you fights the moment of tension that youve been waiting for this sequence as you load  the weapon he says it loudly enough for you to hear but this voice now you see lord briarwood  says would you look at that dear the pup yet lives chuckles gunshot  laughter  matt a big chunk of flesh /none/ is just blown off and you can see the bone beneath grunts growls  kit no mercy percy  taliesin is that as far as i can make it  matt its as far as you can get you still have your heroic action if you wanted to do that  holding onto it okay all right so that will end your turn seeker is then going to turn this way  step towards the side and pull his crossbow out it was already loaded with a bolt into it and  hes going to take a shot at grog /none/ whos currently the biggest target right now thats going to be  rolled a two thats going to be a 13 against armor class  travis misses  matt yeah goes and for the bonus action reloads and gets the second shot at you  that will be a 19  travis hits  matt all right you take seven points of piercing damage halved because of your rage and with the  rest of his movement seeker asums going to go ahead and step back in the shadow beside there  ending that turn now it comes to lord /none/ briarwood  marisha wait i didnt get my turn  matt keyleth youre up after him  liam and i have a question at some point im in the mix  matt yeah youre coming up dont worry you guys rolled the lowest initiatives  orion oh hes prone still  matt hes still prone yeah so sylas is going to seeing the circumstance reach down and  attempt to grab you  sam get out of there  matt he has disadvantage because of that laughs all right  thats going to be a total of 11  liam /none/ to do what to grapple check do i have to roll too  matt to attempt to grapple you yeah  liam so i roll as well  matt you dont have to  liam yeah fuck that guy  matt yeah so it missed entirely all right so thats with his first strike second one hes  going to go for another attempted grapple on you with disadvantage that comes to 18  liam for hitting  matt for hitting you all right and now hes going to make an athletics check to attempt to  grapple you that /none/ is going to be a 13  sam as i see this going on can i call out with cutting words to distract him  matt you could yes  sam okay singing distraction distraction distraction distraction distraction  matt go ahead and roll a d10  sam what do i roll  matt d10 and subtract that from his attack modifier  sam six  matt okay with that as he reaches down in an attempt to grapple you and grab you by the throat  the fingers are coming towards you and you try and attempt to roll /none/ out of the way all of sudden you  hear distraction and lord briarwoods annoyed sigh you see his massive eyeroll and  then goes in for the attack but thats given you enough time to roll out of the way his hand only  meets the ground hes then going to step back and get adjacent to lady briarwood that ends his  turn keyleth youre up  marisha okay im going to fly out the window with scanlan  matt out the broken one over here or the nonbroken one  marisha the broken one  matt okay /none/  sam what are you doing to me  matt so youre coasting over here  marisha im going to go ahead and drop him off  matt okay so as you swoop down and leave scanlan right there in front of them thatll be there  marisha so seeker asum hes against us  matt you have no idea you just swooped out there and hes there like hiding in the shadow  marisha but he just fired at grog  matt you didnt see it though from your perspective there you just saw a bolt go  marisha /none/ oh i didnt see that do i still have enough movement to make an action  matt yeah you do yes that was just your movement as you swooped down  marisha wheres lord briarwood  matt right there  marisha im going to go and try and peck his eyes out  sam are you dropping me  marisha yeah i dropped you off im going to go and swoop over  matt okay youve already used your movement to get there and drop him off and go all the way  around  marisha thats what i was /none/ asking  matt yeah you used your full movement to get there and drop off scanlan  travis do you still want to be an eagle  liam yeah because its a hit point sponge  marisha yeah you know what ill drop eagle form  matt okay keyleth all of a sudden the eagle condenses down and forms back into keyleth in her  halfelven form  marisha and i will also use my bonus action to cast healing word on vax  matt okay  marisha and i will also cast it at actually ill cast it at /none/ a 3rd level because  i want to be safe  sam here are some d4s  marisha thank you  laura she cast it at vax  sam so you need one more right at level three  marisha oh and its plus my spell modifier is that what it is plus ten so yeah i need one  more so thats 17 points  matt 17 points of healing  orion hers is different  marisha oh no wait no 15 sorry  sam youre back  laura youre back baby  matt and with that vax  /none/ liam you have to tell me whats possible im prone right  matt you are prone on the ground  liam this is what id like to do you tell me if its possible id like to click my boots of haste  together and then get up which takes my full movement what does it take  matt half your movement  liam half my movement this is what i want to do you tell me if its possible click my boots of  haste get up use disengage again and then run like a motherfuck straight towards  /none/ matt yeah you could probably do that yeah  travis do it  liam thats what i want to do  sam straight towards what  liam my sister and as i run past i share a very awkward glance with keyleth and keep going and  just run and lock eyes with my sister and run at her  matt okay and whats your full movement then it would be 30 times two which would be 60 half  that so you can run 30 feet because it takes half your movement to get up so yeah you disengage /none/  there you go  laura there you go  sam well good im glad im tip of the spear now jesus laughs how did that happen  laura dimension door  matt all right that ends your turn at the top is vex  laura all right im going to  travis kill some people  laura okay yeah im going to take a healing potion a superior which is what  matt superior would be 8d4 plus eight  laura thats so many fours  travis its not like you dont have 30 dice anyway so many dice /none/  marisha these fuckers im so angry at them  laura 20 oh 28 thats good and then im going to cast im sorry hunters mark im going to  cast hail of thorns right at the one in the middle theyre right next to each other right  matt yeah you would be scooting right over scanlans head with your arrow  laura lets stick it to lady briarwood again cool balls oh wait do i i dont need to roll  to hit on that right  matt it would say on the spell  laura oh wait /none/ thats wrong oh the next time i hit a creature oh so i dont think i hit her  that was 15  matt 15 would not hit unfortunately  laura okay then i try it again i didnt hit her again its because youre safe now buddy  matt so as she stands there grinning looking over all this theyre both amused by this whole  circumstance there isnt really a glimmer of fear as the first arrow comes by she leans to  the side just dodges it a little bit the second one comes towards her and /none/ lord briarwood deflects  it out from in front of her and gives you a look of like dont you dare touch my woman  laura wheres trinket  matt trinket is somewhere  laura okay did he hear i whistle again  matt you whistle again okay thats your turn  matt all right so with that you see the dragonborn comes flying up through the window and  delilah looks back at everyone and sees everyone rushing forward and says honey well deal with  them worse comes to worst  and she glances up at you but /none/ you  orion im tiberius stormwind  matt yes indeed you are as she looks at you for a second and theres this sparkle this  prismatic glow of light in her eyes i need you  orion 4thlevel counterspell were you saying something  matt hold on  marisha hold on laughs i think distance makes a difference with these people  matt all right so youre going to attempt to counter lets do this  sam dice versus

feel this counteractive arcane energy if she hadnt rolled a natural one on her  counterspell that wouldve been pretty bad but through the sheer force of frustration and anger  at this point now the lightning bolt /none/ presses through her counter and the bolt is released in  that direction arcing towards both of them  sam wait she rolled a one  matt she rolled a one to try and counter your

legendary resistance  laura wait how many times does he get that damn thing  travis hes like a dragon  kit its fine ill wear /none/ him out  matt remember the target still becomes frightened for the duration so now as you do  this and look up lord briarwood has had this cocky grin the whole time sees this sudden albino  tiefling in the window glare down and send this shimmering wave of arcane energy hissing from  above the echo of the hiss hits lord briarwood and for the first time you see him recoil in  strange momentary terror and seems to almost step back into the side of his wife glances over his  shoulder towards her and she gives /none/ him a look of misunderstanding and acknowledgement so he cannot  get near you currently cannot get any closer to you and has disadvantage  against anything against you  travis just her or us  matt just her  travis clap hands  matt all right very cool so thats your turn on that one percy  marisha percy  taliesin im going to take a standard walking speed 30 feet straight ahead swinging bad news  back onto my back pulling out pepperbox sylas im getting his attention again im going to  start shooting with  sam /none/ are you still in disguise  taliesin no i dont think anymore  matt no the moment you fired the illusion dissipated  taliesin yeah so im going to be using my sharpshooter for this  matt okay go for it  taliesin thats

taliesin 18  matt 18 does not hit the first shot impact off the shoulder and the second one impact hits the  same /none/ point where bad news hit the arm blasting off another portion of the flesh and the third  one this time you can actually see the shadows coalesce around him and the shot just misses  through the darkness and reforms into the physical form of sylas as youre finishing your turn  that you can see sylas flesh is reforming and healing rapidly from the damage hes taken the  actual tendons are forming back up from the blast damage hes looking at you with a slight  grin but then nervously back at the tiefling in the window /dung/ back and forth at this point in time  asum is going to go ahead and back up this way and is going to use an action to hide rolls a three  terrible absolutely useless all right so sylas now is going to angrily look around and pulls off  from the back you can see this shimmer as there was an illusion dissipates and what previously  looked like it was an empty back a large scabbard appears pulling this giant dark slategray  greatsword from the back and lunges forward towards you grog  marisha sylas  /none/ laura did someone ever get uriel  matt you have not seen uriel no all right is going to then make a strike at you  thats a 26 to hit  travis hits  matt all right you take 12 points of slashing damage reduced to six and i need you to go ahead  and make a constitution saving throw  travis do i have advantage on those if im raging  matt no you just have a high constitution  sam he still has disadvantage on attacks right that wore off  travis 18  matt 18 /none/ all right you feel like the actual wound from the blade is attempting to draw some force  from your body but you just grunts and flex and whatever arcane enchantment is resisted turns  around for a second swipe that is going to be a 19  travis hits  matt hits all right you take 15 points of slashing damage half that to seven or be eight  round up for use so eight and make another constitution saving throw  travis damn it ha even better 21  matt yeah once again theres some sort of enchantment /none/ thats trying to pull from the wounds  as it hits you and you just grin them off with this chuckle so hes going to use the rest of his  movement to step back a little bit you get an attack of opportunity  travis i do  matt yes you do with the hammer  travis yes thats 24  matt 24 hits go ahead and roll damage  travis awesome thats 11 plus four points of fire damage so 15  matt okay 15 cool  that ends his turn keyleth  marisha my turn okay wait /none/ where did briarwood go lord briarwood  taliesin and matt right there  marisha oh he backed up beautiful so i take my staff and i crack it on the ground where i  cracked it little ice crystals start forming against the ground and start making ice and im  going to cast sleet storm i need a thing  sam i have a 20 what do you want  marisha no i need a  sam what do you need  marisha a laser pointer there you go so its a 40foot radius starting where briarwood is  /none/ matt all righty a 40foot radius  marisha right starting in this line grogs not in it  matt this way you mean  marisha from here back  matt so sleet storm boom right in that area right there so as you slam the ground the ice  begins to move around and all of a sudden the cold air begins to form this almost like mist as  the temperature shift suddenly impacts the surrounding vicinity the grass freezes in place  and you can see bits of ice and sleet begin to rain down in the vicinity /none/  marisha so the ground in the area is difficult terrain it is covered with slick ice when a  creature enters the spells area for a first time or on its turn starts its turn there it must make  a dexterity saving throw or else its knocked prone because they slip and fall if a creature  is concentrating in the spells area the creature must make a successful concentration saving throw  against your spells dc or lose concentration  matt good to know  sam and you have inspiration  matt cool all righty so  /none/ marisha and then i move back  matt that ends your turn vax  liam okay im going to throw one dagger at briarwoods face  matt all right go for it  liam thats a one if im hasted can i do two potions instead of attack attack attack  matt no the additional action is not so much a potion  liam all right so im taking a potion of greater healing and walking backward walking distance  and greater healing is 4d4 right  matt greater healing is 4d4 plus four yeah all right that ends your /none/ turn vex youre up  laura yes knowing that they seem to be vampires because theyve fucking creepy teeth im going to  pull out one of my holy arrows and shoot it at lord briarwoods in the way of lady briarwood  now isnt he  matt you can try and shoot either if you want to move over to the side and get a better view  laura well im going to cast hunters mark on him  matt on him okay  laura and then im going to shoot my holy arrow through my blazing bowstring one /none/ more time  matt okay go for it  laura come on hold on 28  matt 28 does hit  laura okay good do i do any additional damage with my holy arrow  matt go ahead and

damage  laura seven more so 29 damage  matt okay good to know so as the arrow impacts impact /none/ sound he puts up his cloak to guard in  time as it goes whooshing through the cloak you hear this grunts in pain as the arrow  bursts and as the cloak comes back you can see this burning sensation across the front of lord  briarwood where the flesh was healing and sewing itself up that has been halted immediately by the  impact of the holy water which is beginning to pockmark and burn his flesh  laura awesome then im going to hit him again laughs so yes im going to do the same thing  /none/ except im out of my blazing bowstring it fizzled out  matt yes  laura okay thats a 29 to hit  matt thatll hit  laura okay thats good plus two radiant damage  matt thats your second holy arrow right  laura yeah  liam what was it before that  laura 17 28 and then another d6 for my hunters mark 32  matt nice second one impact shatters and you can see now like part of the jaw is hurt and  wounded panting theres this wild frenzy to his face as you can see lord /none/ briarwood is  starting to look a little ragged all right that ends your turn  laura yes  matt lady delilah briarwood steps forward up to the back of her husband  marisha shes got to make a dex throw  matt she does and against the spell cause its magic she gets advantage that would be an 18  whats the dc  marisha it just says they just have to make a dexterity saving throw or theyre knocked prone  matt right but its against your dc of your spell  marisha oh is it 18  /none/ matt so yeah she makes it so she steps forward almost slips but catches herself on the shoulder  of her husband and says my dear i fear its time that we make our leave  sam make our leave  marisha no theyre going to bamf  matt casts dimension door both of them whoosh out of visible range  sam wait i turn to vex vex does your hunters mark tell you where they went they just  disappeared whered they go  laura they fucking

corner  marisha i can probably teleport us through a tree right  sam thats okay well just run  laura theyre right there  matt as you guys rush /none/ around the corner you can see on the very edge of the cobblestone walkway  the carriage that they came in is now gaining speed  taliesin sharpshoot right now im going to try and take out a wheel  travis yelling close the gates  taliesin 27  matt 27 hits go ahead and roll damage  orion nice  taliesin 20 points of damage  matt 20 points of damage all right the wheel splinters and grinding sound is now coasting on  the ground the young gentleman who is currently on the top is looking over his /none/ shoulder trying  desperately to usher them away  marisha how roughly far away are they  matt right now theyre about a hundred feet  laura is trinket anywhere near them  matt trinket was over at the stables on the far back of the palace unfortunately  marisha i still have my sleet storm up its a concentration spell  im going to move it over

again  matt so youre casting sleet storm again whats the range on it  marisha 150 feet  matt 150 feet the sleet storm lands down the cobblestone becomes sleek the carriage begins  rocking back and forth however it does manage to keep on its course currently it does not get  knocked prone its hard to knock a carriage prone but it is sliding out of the way  taliesin is that a disadvantage because it only has three wheels  matt good call actually  marisha and /none/ its rough terrain  matt that is a two  cheering  matt at this point the carriage crash slams onto the side of the ground and skids creaking  to a halt in the middle of the ice the sleet still spackling down as you guys all turn the  corner now as you approach the gates have closed slamming as the guards have slammed it  listening to grog on the far side the door pops open on the side of the carriage tiberius as  youve made your way back around and youre at the front now /none/ panting and you can see now about 60  feet in front of you the carriage is overturned in the middle of this sleet storm on the ground  orion where is it  matt from a visual standpoint youre about 60 to 70 feet from the front of this the doors slam  open and you can see lord and lady briarwood step out  laura can i shoot my exploding arrow  matt hold on as youve guys are just turning the corner you can see now lord briarwood stands  up and is trying to compose himself /none/ ruffles himself up angrily looking at his damaged circumstance lady  briarwoods against his shoulder and she goes clicks tongue well sighs at the very least  i

laura damn it  sam /none/ critical fail  laura 11  matt 11 so half that six damage to each she needs to make a concentration check advantage on  that for war caster yeah thats a 19 okay so explosion a portion of the outside of the  carriage just blows apart wood shrapnel goes flying to each other side as the smoke settles  and the explosion you can see both lord and lady briarwood are still standing there seemingly  unscathed by the event she wraps her arms around him and whispers in his ear its all right and  they both /none/ whoosh vanish in a swirl of arcane energy you dont recognize it because right now  you dont have the intelligence to really  taliesin i want to walk over to the carriage driver  matt you walk over to the carriage driver who is currently on the ground this young

temple  matt okay you guys leap onto the back of keyleth as she rides off  laura i hold onto your mighty mane and then him as well  matt allura takes tiberius takes you by the elbow and leads you over the rest of the group as  they ride off if you are indeed going to /none/ a cleric perhaps you should take tiberius with you  hes not well  sam he seems totally normal to me seems like every day yep thats pretty much basic him  travis is seeker asum still around  matt seeker asum currently is nowhere near this situation  orion i lick all of vox machina  matt all that are present because many are now riding away on a horse laughs but the rest of  them get a fine licking  travis oh jeez no  orion i lick grog the most  travis smells like flies  /none/ matt you all manage to make you way up to the temple of sarenrae the lantern light of the  interior of the temples main structure is low as it is late in the evening nevertheless the gates  are always open and as you enter you are greeted by two clerics that are dressed in long flowing  yellow and gold robes and there is one elderly cleric that you recall the one that led the  resurrection ritual on pike not but almost a year ago actually  laura i hop down off of keyleth  laughter  /none/ laura i take you down as well and i say please please sir i hope were not disturbing  you but we need your help again  liam i totally eat it and just hit the ground  travis that wasnt my fault  matt the two younger clerics step away as the older one steps forward hes balding on top this  long straggly white gray hair that crests  orion i go up to him and start sniffing him sniffing noises  marisha he used to be a very intelligent sorcerer this is part of the problem  /none/ matt there does appear to be arcane residue on this one yes we could hope to cleanse him of  this come enter light the lanterns and the clerics all start turning up various lanterns and  the magical light source of it as soon as you enter the temple a cold ripple sensation begins  to curl on the back of your neck as you step in as you do step in too the two clerics give you a  look and are uncomfortable with the presence and as it has you guys through your travels you  have /none/ encountered very few tieflings let alone on this continent in fact most you have  met were in vasselheim this one in emon stands out like a sore thumb and everyone seems to be  just a little put off by her presence  laura i thought she was disguised  matt thats right never mind i retract that entire sequence  kit hes still looking nervous  matt as she comes out of this feverish daydream none of that happened  laughter  liam im so glad that didnt happen  matt illusions all right so as you guys /none/ enter the center of the chamber he begins burning  various incenses as you step up the cleric says understand these services are intensive in the  costs required to present them to you  laura well pay whatever cost you need  sam no we should haggle dont you think  laura no  orion i lick the cleric  matt chuckles the cleric oh no that thats thats very  sam how much will it take to save our friends  laura sir anything  matt he says for this one we require a donation to the temple /none/ of sarenrae of a hundred  gold pieces  laura oh done  matt he steps forward and touches the side of your head on your temple and begins to focus the  symbol of sarenrae begins to glow on the front of his clavicle and suddenly you can see these  strange gray veins that had wrapped around the sides of tiberiuss head retract dissipate then  fade as intelligence swells back into your brain and for the first time in at least the past half  an hour or so you are back to being tiberius stormwind  /none/ orion licking sounds  sam well thats uncalled for  marisha could there be side effects or something  orion no i just wanted to really do that that was really inconvenient lets help vax  sam oh youre with us again  orion yes  sam oh well welcome back how was it being dumb  orion i was quite frightened most of the time i didnt know what was going on i couldnt cast  spells and i was lets help vax  liam you didnt shit yourself so youre a winner  orion thats good yes you /none/ shit yourself vax i cast prestidigitation on his butt  liam what the oh  laura youre clean dont worry  matt okay as you bring vax forward the cleric leans forward what is wrong with this one  laura he was bitten by something quite unholy  matt oh the good news is if youre standing here then most of the danger is gone however  there might be some residual of the infection he leans forward and inspects it for a second  reaches into his pouch and pulls out some herbs and presses them into it it /none/ burns a little bit  marisha ooh do i recognize what herbs hes using  matt make a nature check  marisha nature check  liam is it sticky  marisha 19 so 29  matt this is glissfoil glissfoil is used by many medicinal practitioners as a means of burning away  infections and cleansing wounds  taliesin he didnt even look down he just said it  liam who didnt know that here honestly  matt as he presses in he looks to you as long as this doesnt get infected it should be all  right i /none/ assume based on what you say the nature of these wounds that is some sort of  laura they drank his blood  matt vampirism  liam yeah  matt from what i know of vampirism it requires many tastes of your life force and bringing you to  the threshold of death and beyond to truly turn you  liam listen doc i cant bite anybody here are you sure  matt unless this is some unnatural thing beyond classic vampirism you should be fine  liam what do you mean unnatural  laura well any vampirism is a /none/ little unnatural  marisha excuse me do you actually have any extra of that glissfoil or any seeds that i could take  with me that way i can just keep up on his daily disinfection  matt certainly he reaches into a pouch and pulls out a handful of glissfoil its like a  dried yellowish green leaf that curls in itself a little bit and gives it to you  marisha thank you so much  orion as it happens i reach for my decanter and i can control the charge its just charged but i  dissipate /none/ the charge but also keep it for a little bit no i dissipate the whole thing and i  turn to the cleric and i go oh holy man which cured my mind would you be so graceful as to use  the force of sarenrae to bless the water in my canteen  sam to what the water  orion to bless it im going to hold it up above my head way too dramatically  matt there are rituals but they take some time if youd like to leave it here we could make use of  this /none/ and bless the contents of it yes  orion no i thought you could like do a  hosannah and get me out of here  matt unfortunately it doesnt work that way but should you require such blessing we would be  happy to oblige  orion wonderful how many days give or take do you think it might take to accomplish  matt for that amount there two days  orion oh wonderful well be here for two days guys  liam probably will  orion ill leave it with you  matt for this volume he looks /none/ at it for a second and says  this is an enchanted vial is it not  orion yes good eye  matt im curious to see how this will interact with the enchantment well try well put it at a  25 gold donation for the two days of enchantment  orion i give you 50  matt thank you  orion thank you for your service the other 25 is for my brain  matt well is there anything else i can do to help you this evening  sam thank you for all your assistance did he /none/ tell us a

matt pike trickfoot  marisha yes do you remember her  laura shes in vasselheim restoring another temple of sarenrae at this moment  liam spreading the good word  matt this deep smile brings his face from this deep melancholy tentativeness to this warmth you  hadnt seen before and he goes i had not /none/ known that our lady had reach as far as vasselheim  offscreen thud  liam oh dear  matt it

gilmore makes a quality item  sam 25  liam that was very awkward scanlan but its true  matt he goes gilmore i think ive seen that shop around  laura theyre opening a shop in here just kidding theres a shop here  sam there is a shop here  matt me and the clerics might have /none/ to go see it then  marisha tell them vox machina sent you  sam and you get ten percent off  liam if you say vaxildan sent

blowing out /none/ the mic but gods damn it im alive  sam that was close  marisha yeah actually while we walk back to greyskull what happened  liam i thought that i could get a peekypoo at what they

that we know of  orion just because were in a keep does not mean we are safe  laura we need to set alarms around our keep  sam we also need to protect our new friend lillith fair over here  liam is that your last name  /none/ sam well shes white so i thought maybe  kit my family name is daturai  marisha how do you spell that  kit chuckles in your tongue daturai  liam i lost track after the d  kit you have had a rough evening its understandable  laura i hope youve learned your lesson  liam itll be two weeks at least before i do anything  laura quite so stupid and reckless  marisha we had a code word  orion we had jumanji  laura jenga  orion oh sorry damn it  laura wheres trinket  /none/ matt you look back at this point and you see as you guys are reaching the outer wall of emon  galloping noise behind you happy bear noises rubs up against you moans  laura your uncle almost died i almost died did you know i almost died darling  matt licks the side of your face  liam i lean in and i lick his nose with my own tongue and then i let him lick me  all over the place  matt sloppy bear noises  taliesin vax  liam yeah  taliesin thank you thank you /none/ for your risk yes you were foolish but thank you  travis i walk up to vax and i extend my hand and i say im glad you didnt die  liam i love you grog would you like to draw balls on my forehead  travis and i reach back and i backhand him as hard as i can  laughter  matt roll an attack  liam i dont move at all i just take it  travis 22  matt go ahead and roll a d4 divided by two  laura thats a six  travis no /none/ its two  matt two plus your strength modifier which i believe is four so you take six points of  backhand bludgeoning damage as grog whacking the echo from the impact  travis and i say no one kills you but me  laura you deserved that  liam yeah  orion lets all get some rest shall we  sam yes but well have to prepare ourselves for an attack or perhaps stalk them and kill them  taliesin well were going to find out in a minute  marisha and dont we have a prisoner  laura /none/ yes  sam and we have a guest  marisha yes and we still havent found what the broker who he is or what he is  sam do you need to run from the broker or can you stay with us for a few days  orion do you owe some money i dont understand  kit how well guarded against scrying is your keep  sam not at all  liam what about your room tiberius  orion yes  laura youre guarded against scrying in your room  orion guards against scrying yes of course  sam /dung/ is that true  laura against scrying  marisha im pretty sure we would have to have an enchantment on our keep that would guard against  scrying  matt as you guys are having this discussion a voice rings out behind you and says dont worry  its not going to help you  travis is that little shitty mr missing one hand  matt no you turn around and look and you can see a gentleman standing there about 25 feet away  from you you see dark brown and black studded leather armor with a cloak over /dung/ one shoulder  standing straight with a grin deep dark red skin burning yellow eyes and jet black slicked  hair between two horns that jut back a tiefling stands there looking forward with two  individuals flanking from side to side that are slowly stepping  orion i dont know what they do but im raising my arm up who goes there who are you ive had a  really bad day  matt the tiefling the male tiefling steps up forward and says ive no quarrel with any of  you weve been scouring this city for a /none/ fugitive for a number of weeks and as luck would have it  you guys happened to smoke her out of her hole  marisha i go ahead and crack my staff on the ground and cast antilife shell  matt okay  liam and are they at the door  matt you guys are walking from the outside of the wall to your keep  liam where are they  matt right now they are coming from emon you guys are in this inbetween section between your keep  liam were outdoors weve left the temple  matt you /none/ are yes and were going to go ahead and have you guys roll initiative  marisha get close to me  matt keyleth started this  marisha get close what did i but thats a spell i cast on myself  matt right casting spells generally for most people is a bad idea  kit natural 20  cheering  matt all right so from a visual perspective here  orion yo stoneskins up dude i didnt get to say that shit  matt stoneskins up on you antilife shell who is where  travis tibs and i are in /none/ the front right because we both took aggressive postures  marisha the closer to me you are the more youll be guarded by the shell  travis who said i want to be guarded  marisha you can still fight around it they just cant get in  matt all righty trinket is over this side here  taliesin and we have a prisoner  matt the prisoner was brought to your keep by the guards  travis as close to the enemy as possible tiberius and i took the aggressive stance  matt yes you guys would be up /dung/ that way all right  laura oh no why is there more than one person  travis he said two people are flanking him  matt as you look at this point you notice the two individuals to the left there is a  sicklylooking older woman with dark verdant clothing that flows and drags behind her to the  right is a shirtless humanoid with darker scarred skin very muscular shirtless torso wearing a  white featureless mask over the face and they both curl to the sides the initiative was  whats the initiative order here so who /none/ got 25 to 20 all righty 20  laura 20  kit 21  orion and 20  matt and 20 for you as well all right okay 20 to 15  sam 19  matt 19 nice grog what did you get  travis 18  matt 18  travis my magic man  matt 15 to ten  liam 13  matt 13  marisha 11  matt all righty percy  taliesin 12  matt whatd you say keyleth you got 11  marisha 11 bringing up the rears  matt all right is that everybody cool /none/ were good so as you crash how big is the radius of  the antilife shell  marisha anyone within ten feet of me a decent amount right now not tiberius not scanlan  laura not trinket  matt not technically grog because grog would be up front right there so a tenfoot radius around  you and what does it do antilife shell  marisha nothing aside from undead and constructs can get into it you can still cast spells and  fire bows and you can still do stuff we can go out they just cant get in /none/  laura thats awesome  matt the top of the round the broker goes rolled a very high initiative high dex  character  travis that is the broker  matt yep sweet lillith youve been a very bad girl nefertiri nethspira and bellenore would  all like to have a word with you theyve paid quite a bit of sum and proven legally you need  to be taken back now to your friends here its your choice the easy way or the hard way  kit i use minor illusion one of my cantrips and i puff up /none/ like a cloud of nightmare and i glow  and my eyes come alight my tail whips my fangs get longer oh i bet you did i bet they paid you  so much you tell my sister i hope her face still festers  matt choice is made and with that whoosh he vanishes from sight  liam ooh  matt that ends his turn  orion wait is he casting that did he cast vanish  matt there was a casting yes  orion sweet counterspell  matt all right go ahead and roll a d20  orion /none/ 4thlevel too  matt all right  marisha do you mean 6thlevel  orion no  matt its a spell  orion humming what is this what  matt oh no it just fails you dont have to roll for this one this is invisibility so as he goes  to vanish you oh as a reaction pull out your counterspell and his image shimmers and then  returns oh thats not even fair  orion i havent gotten to do much today and you wont either  matt very good well hes then going to use his move action /none/ to shift over this way to there all  right that ends him lillith youre up  kit okay i would like to  liam buy a vowel  sam come on kit buss come on fuck him up kit buss  kit can i use phantasmal killer again please  matt if youd like to yeah all right against which one  kit against the broker  matt all righty so hes going to go ahead and make his wisdom saving throw whats your dc  kit 17  matt all right go ahead and roll 4d10 psychic damage /none/  laura 4d10 holy shit do you need extra ones heres a gold one for you  kit thank you oh wow i have so many pretty dice right now its lovely ooh yeah ooh so 29  liam little bit of kit  matt this is blending in because the spell usually triggers on the start of his next turn  this is you both going at the same time and conjoining your minor illusion fear into hitting  him with this spell and working its this combination of everything hitting at once all  right and as that /none/ hits you see he looks at you and his expression goes from glee to terror and  hes immediately reconsidering his decision here do you want to stay where you are or do you want  to move  kit ill stay where i am  matt all right that ends your turn vex youre up tiberius youre up at the same time well go  with vex first  laura i want to tell trinket to cannonball over the two lined up right there  matt all right trinket galloping sounds rolls forward and bear rolling sounds both of /none/ them  try to move out of the way they both get their dex save all right so broker manages to pull out of  the way just in time however the other the big thicker character doesnt quite have the dexterity  to shift out of the way and takes the full impact okay he suffers 14 points of bludgeoning damage  as trinket tears through  laura eat it go trinket  matt he is knocked prone  laura good job buddy little buddy  matt thats trinkets attack  laura then i get a move still i /none/ mean i get an action im going attack him im going to attack  the broker  matt for how that works for you and your bear because thats his attack this turn  laura i mean yes im assuming thats his attack or was that his move  matt well thats his attack its been a while since you attacked with trinket  laura i get to have trinket attack and then i get to attack  matt once right  laura wait attack action plus trinket attack it says one attack for me and two attacks for  /none/ trinket  liam trinket gets two attacks  matt you can make one attack yourself while commanding it so you get one weapon attack  liam i think you should erase that and write seven  matt as trinket goes by since it didnt hit him he gets an attack of opportunity on trinket does  hit trinket does take seven points of slashing damage from the broker as he misses him and he  hits as he goes by  laura but hes got armor on all right fine  matt he rolled a 21 to hit  laura /none/ okay and then im going to shoot an arrow okay that would be 26  matt 26 against the broker all right go for it  laura 14 im going to assume i mean its probably way too far but i want to keep my  hunters mark on lord briarwood for the time being so im not going to break that even though  hes probably far away so its just 14 damage to the broker  matt all right the brokers going to make a concentration check maintains concentration all  right as the arrow whooshing moves out /none/ of the way hits the armor and splinters past not  dealing any physical damage but you see the broker is now visibly shaken by the two members of  the party and sweat is starting to bead his confidence he strolled into is quickly failing  all right that ends vexs turn tiberius  orion okay can i see the broker where i am at now  matt grogs in the way you can barely see  orion i doesnt matter i can see good enough im going to spend three sorcery points and  heighten my spell which /none/ gives disadvantage on both those two rolls im going to cast a 5thlevel  fireball right on the cusp where it hits those two buttholes  matt here  liam dont hit trinket  matt right there it would hit both of them and not hit trinket  orion there it is  matt okay so they both have disadvantage on their saving throws  orion thats what heighten spell does  matt okay cool as you arc around the side you release the one single beam of flashing red  energy sparks at the end of the finger lobs /dung/ forward explosion with a gargantuan explosion  red flames swirl into the area sending the whole area the dark part of the night open field  alight you see all the green dried grass is immediately burnt to a black crisp go ahead and  roll damage whats the dc  orion 17  matt yeah they both fail with disadvantage full damage  sam all the dice  orion all of them  liam laughs oh my god  orion and then im going to spend one sorcery point to empower the spell and then im going to  /none/ use the six and im going to choose one two three and four and five and six to reroll  liam think of how handy that wouldve been against the briarwoods  orion  four five six okay im going to roll these  sam much better  laura thats amazing  matt you can only use one metamagic option on a spell when you cast it  orion empower spell is the only one that doubles with any other metamagic i can do it  matt oh interesting good to know thank you for the heads up thats cool /none/ i like that  sam 38 41  orion 46  matt 46  orion spellcasting sound effect  matt as the explosion bursts forth the flames dissipate you can see the broker there looking  angry frightened immediately takes some of the flame  orion before he does that i go laughing i look over at keyleth and i use bonus action to  cast misty step and i go right next to her and i vanish  matt okay you vanish behind her and as he pulls back the flames and then releases them they snake  between /none/ everyone and go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw  orion i make it but its fire  matt it is fire damage  orion good instead of missing it im going to swoosh gulps swallow it grunts thats 20 my  dex save was 20 sorry  matt oh okay good thank you for the heads up on that  travis you swallowed it  matt so you take half damage the angry tiefling hits you with a hellish rebuke  orion blowing smoke through my nose snorts  matt it would be seven damage you take half /dung/ damage from fire so that would be four fire  damage as you take the hellish rebukes burst of flaming dark arcane energy and gulps swallow  it and take it in you blow it out the side of your nostrils and it burns but damn does it look cool  orion and thats my turn  matt scanlan youre up  sam me shit is that the old lady over there  matt over here on this side yeah  sam okay ill take a step towards her and i will try its never worked for me it probably /none/ wont  work ill try eyebite on her  liam this is the time right here right now  sam what do i roll im doing it through my horn of clarity or whatever  matt all right so its a wisdom saving throw on her end whats the dc on that is it 19  sam 19  matt okay so no that does not make it so whatre you choosing  sam okay i choose sleep singing rockabye old lady  matt so she turns around shes holding this gnarled wand in her hand as she comes around /none/  she gives you this strange look and goes what and falls unconscious on the ground asleep  marisha thats awesome  liam i didnt watch matlock  sam and then ill just inspire our new tiefling friend with a little sexy dance  kit is he always like this  laura yes he is dont you feel so inspired  kit oh you have no idea  matt you take a d10 inspiration dice it makes you laugh its less of an attraction thing and  more of a oh gnomes theyre so small  kit oh how special /none/  matt all right that ends your turn grog youre up  travis all right everybodys doing new stuff with 50foot speed can i get to the far  side of the old lady thats sleeping  matt yeah  travis can i get like behind her so i can i need the laser pointer  taliesin you want to get right there right  travis yes yeah on the opposite side of her from where i am  sam shes asleep what are you going to do  liam kill that motherfucker  matt you can get there  /none/ travis thats what id like to do  marisha she will wake up unless you cleave her in half she will wake up  laura its grog he doesnt give a shit about that  travis i take out the javelin of lightning i whisper the command word which is penelope and i  throw it in a straight line which will hit all three of them in a fivefootwide line that extends  120 feet  laura youre so smart grog  taliesin you just did math  laura look at you  when it comes to battle he /none/ knows things  matt all right so thats five foot wide so itll hit him and one of these or her and one of  these two guys it hits something in a fivefoot line  travis the guy thats standing  laura yeah the broker get the broker  matt so you pull it out and as you throw it downward the javelin goes from a metallic blade  into a bolt of arcing electric energy that slams downward penelope does not not penelope you  keep shouting it at me the old woman on the ground gets no /none/ saving throw because shes  unconscious and she takes double damage  travis double damage  matt so 4d6  travis 4d6 14  liam killed that old woman so good  travis and if he makes a saving throw of a dc 13 its halved  matt the javelin arcs through and goes towards there and then he does make his dexterity saving  throw against that hes a pretty dexterous guy  travis it takes a little shock though  matt right so it takes a little bit of damage which was what was it you rolled was /none/ it a 14 so  it takes seven points of lightning damage for that and then make a ranged attack on the actual  javelin  travis what does that do i dont even have that on here i have no idea  matt oh sorry that was against the target so since he was the target he takes the impact the  lightning bolt arcs through the old woman she screams shakes awake screaming as the bolt arcs  upward from the ground and right before it goes toward the broker as he rears back in fear it  /none/ solidifies into the javelin as it once again slams into the front of his torso hes like grunting  gasping he pulls it out shakes it for a second looking at it confused  travis i look at tiberius and i go i did magic  orion it was very impressive good job grog  travis thank you penelope  orion thats my mothers name  laura oh no he got up  matt the guy gets up and only has a half move  laura can he get that close  matt on half movement yeah runs up to /none/ you as he does so you can see holding on his side gets  up and goes bolting towards you arcing around the side  marisha he runs he runs smackdab into my wall my arcane  matt antilife shell the antilife shell does  marisha blocks living things they cant come in  orion unless you invite them  marisha like vampires  matt it was a tenfoot radius you said  marisha yeah  matt okay  liam vaxildan flips him the double birds as he hits the wall  laura from inside the wall  matt so /none/ hes unable to just runs forward hits the barrier skids past hold his place there  instead then  liam thats unfortunate  matt however has a spear  laura oh shit  laughter  matt still rushes around with it both hands on it arcing towards you with it that is going to be  liam can i use uncanny dodge with it or is it too late  matt well thats okay it rolled a three to hit plus eight thats going to be an 11 so no it  just whiffing it swings wide with the spear /none/ this is going very poorly for them all right  vax its your turn now  liam okay so i look around at all these amazing people that i am so blessed to be with and  barely even looking i just go dagger dagger dagger over this assholes head at the broker  yeah the first one is not that great but its all right its an 18 these guys are dickheads  matt all right 18 against the broker just barely hits  liam all right thats ten points of damage the second dagger hits him i hope /none/ 19  matt

the center of his chest there  would be no dripping except for the cauterization of the heat round that exploded in his /none/ chest and  is a blackened cinderous tube where once there was a chest cavity the broker death rattle  thud falls onto his back with a smoldering spiral of black smoke pouring forth from the chest wound  on the ground as you stare at the other two screaming that out you can see the old woman  whos still on the ground panicked gasps looks extremely out of place and freaked out  sam sorry doris youd better just lie down  matt the masked individual from what you can tell behind the eyes of the mask does /none/ not seem  emotionally affected by this  taliesin also just checking does my glove still have a charge by the way  matt it may  taliesin okay i mean is there any indication like it would have a slight glow to it  matt there is a slight vibration that ends your turn  taliesin that is the end of my turn  matt all right the old woman gets up and is like panicked gasps  liam old lady voice i feel happy i feel alive  sam youre in atlantic city everythings okay  matt as /none/ a bonus action casts misty step and appearing 30 feet over here  travis do i get to swing  matt no because misty step happens  travis damn misty and her steps  matt she stands up and vanishes in a swirl of vapor she appears a little ways away in the field  and immediately mumbles a spell  orion counterspell 5thlevel fuck it  matt you would be able to because it has been your turn you would have your reaction back so yes  you could so go ahead and roll a d20  laura matts /none/ like damn you and your counterspells youre ruining my plan  orion 23  matt laughs so she mumbles a spell gasps  laughter  travis thats the best running ive ever seen the little gait  matt tries to run away the slippery wet grass she slips a little bit as shes trying to get away now  laura i feel bad for her  matt that ends her turn keyleth youre up  marisha upon seeing percy go absolutely insane and screaming your soul is now forfeit out of  shock my antilife shell dissipates and i spend /none/ my action staring at him  matt all right  liam wow going for the roleplay not the damage  matt the brokers not getting a turn lillith youre up  kit okay i would like to use animate dead on the broker please  liam gasps you nasty woman you  laura hes so happy about it  matt you can begin using it because its a oneminute casting time you have to get closer  because youre probably a ways away  kit right okay  liam youve got a naughty streak  kit its my family i /none/ cannot help it  matt well say from there you begin concentrating on animate dead as you begin pulling  through and speaking in guttural tones that have multiple layers of tonality and volume its this  weird symphony of discordant voices as she begins to speak you can see now the smoking ruined body  of the broker begins to shift and twitch on its own so thatll conclude your turn lillith vex  and tiberius you guys are up  marisha youve got asshole  laura im going to attack him with a bow im going to attack /none/ him with my entangle arrow  matt okay  laura all right  matt the big guy  laura yeah the

hits  laura all right 15 plus entangle whatever  matt all right good to know and so as you pull back the arrow and release it there is that the way  that /none/ you constructed it theres just this pouch of very thick gooey is this the spell or is it  the actual arrow constructed by percy  laura its the arrow  matt right the one that he built so what happens is that the front of the arrow it doesnt  do any actual damage on the impact instead what it does is it when it smacks into it theres a  pouch in the front that detonates from the impact and sends this very quicksetting tar like glue  substance that just spatters across the body and lower torso /none/ it expands like a foam theres no  damage on that one but its currently grunts grappled by it and cannot move from its place  laura awesome and so ill shoot another arrow at the other lady  matt okay go for it roll for an attack  laura i know shes running away but shes a bad guy i didnt hit her though  matt what did you roll  laura 16  matt heh its funny mages dont have a lot of armor even with mage armor you manage to hit her  square in the back /none/ go ahead and roll damage  laura 16  matt she goes cries out and stumbles and catches herself and gets back up and you can see  the arrow sticking straight up out of her back probably four inches into the back of her shoulder blade  marisha this is becoming a monty python sketch  liam old lady voice i feel fine i feel happy  matt trinket growls growls menacingly she goes terrified shriek and yelps out as the  giant bear  travis will you start running for us

sam wait the guy in the mask is prone  matt the guy in the mask is currently grappled his lower body is currently held in this weird  tarlike substance hes like grunts trying to break free  sam i only

lady again  matt let me see if you can for another creature but cant target a creature again oh if it  succeeded on a saving throw youre right so she can so what do you want to do  laura i think its tiberiuss turn he and i have the same initiative  matt oh thats right sorry about that  sam oh are you going to hold  matt so he waits for you to finish but he can hold his turn  sam ill just run up

breathing falls asleep on the ground with the arrow arrow  twang right out of the back and you acquiesce to tiberius its your go  sam oh and ill inspire him with a musical fart fart noise  orion that

damage has he  matt hes taken quite a bit of damage  liam dont be ageist that is an evil bitch she needs to be killed  travis ageist  matt all right tiberius whatre you doing shes /none/ currently asleep on the ground this guys  like grunts  orion am i within 60 feet of the old lady thats pretty far still dont know whether i am or not  matt nope shes just out of the range  sam ive fallen and i cant get up  orion okay i am within 120 right so what im going to do instead is im going to look down and  im going to pull out my krull blade and im going to throw it in the air and cast telekinesis on it  spinning  matt okay /none/ as you do it catches itself spinning in the air up ahead of you spinning this  strange vibrating highpitched whine sound as the blades are spinning in rapid circular motion  orion and im going to go swishing and im going to huck it at the chick  matt okay go ahead and roll a spell attack roll  orion thats 31  matt yeah its also a critical hit because shes currently asleep so its an autocrit so go  ahead and roll 5d4 a d4 for each dagger on the spinning blade spinning at high speed plus /none/ five  or 5d4 times two plus five  marisha 5d4 times two plus five  matt yep so just roll 5d4 and then multiply everything by two  orion six seven eight nine ten 11 12 13  matt so 26 plus five is 31 points of damage the unconscious woman face down on the ground the  blade tears through and grinds a large wedge out of her back spraying a bit of gore across the  nearby grass thankfully she was asleep so she probably didnt feel it it was so fast but she  is definitively /none/ gone  marisha we are being sadistic today  orion and ill bring it back to me ill keep it hovering maintain the spell im going to bonus  action misty step towards where grog is thats my turn  matt ill say for the sake of brevity at this point because you have a glued guy and the  entire team pretty much at full health here over time you all slowly gather around the guy whos  glued to the ground and hes fighting at first grunts and you see he lowers his head giving  into his /none/ fate  orion smart to not test your fate boy  travis lillith can i go play tball with his head  liam no let him live let this one live  travis what were letting people live now  matt at which point the head lifts he goes no kill me give me honor i have fallen  liam oh im sorry i retract that  orion krull blade in the neck  marisha oh you just elbowed me  liam did you just hit keyleths funny bone  marisha yes right in the funny bone  orion its /none/ kind of funny  liam grog will you kill this guy  kit if honor is what he wants do not give it to him let him live  laura ooh i like it i walk up and i take his mask off  matt all right you pull the mask off  liam i know what to do scanlan this is your moment shit on his face  laura no thats disgusting  sam listen thats not just something i can do whenever  liam who are you kidding  sam i have to be in the mood i /none/ need music some nice lighting i need to be wined and dined a bit  liam my sisters right do it on his chest  matt at which point you pop the mask off and from immediately beneath it reaches up and covers  the face  sam this is the broker  laura this is the masked guy  matt you can the face beneath its humanoid but right as you get past the nose and the mouth area  its all melted like a horrible acid burn theres severe damage to the face he looks at you  /none/ and goes kill me its all i have  laura sorry darling you live  matt angry growl and its flexing and reaching out at you but it cant quite get the range its  going to attempt to try to no it just cannot break free of that strained grunts as youre  still concentrating on the spell slowly the broker steps up the eyes rolled back and white  the giant wound in the chest hobbles towards you  liam it was almost my turn can i throw daggers at him  laura no she just reanimated him /none/  liam you reanimated him oh then never mind im sorry im sorry  matt as you pull your blade out she commands and gives a hand motion and the broker hobbles  towards her  kit my sisters they sent you they are still hunting me  matt you look down the mark that was there on your chest has vanished upon the point of the  brokers death whatever enchantment was placed upon you that was keeping you under his gaze was  abolished  kit return to palac lusterka and present yourself to my sisters let them /none/ see what good it will do  them to hunt me  matt turns around and starts shambling off  orion oh wait a minute hold on and i as hes walking away im going to loot that dude take  shit off him come on hold on let me take this  matt there is a mostly ruined set of studded leather armor that is enchanted plus one its  basic but its need of serious repair as it currently has a large gaping hole in the chest  area and a shortsword plusone vicious shortsword as tiberius is /none/ pulling everything off  of the corpse as its trying to shamble away into the distance eventually this halfnaked ruined  body of this tiefling begins stepping off into the night  laura what about the old lady do we get any loot off her  matt laughs the old lady has mostly a basic wand its a plusone wand  laura heres a wand i toss it back to them  liam scanlan tibs who wants a wand  sam ill take it all right  matt plusone wand of the war mage  marisha plusone wand of the /none/ war mage  matt a simple ring of protection  laura theres a ring i take it put it on for the time being  matt and about roughly 320 gold amongst the two of them at this point in time the other guys  exhausted himself now just still in place you see the broker vanish into the shadows heading  southward  marisha shall we throw him in the pen with the other guy  orion hold on a second why would we keep this one around to tell us now whatd be the point i  will /none/ kill this man unless you give me a good reason not to  kit i look at him and i ask this my sisters they are responsible for this  matt he gives you a look for a second ive been this my whole life they gave me purpose i follow  them and youve hurt the mistresses  kit that is true i did do something similar to bellenores face but they will not give you  purpose you are better out of their shadow trust me i know you should find better purpose for  yourself go be /none/ free i doubt that they will trouble you any more  matt make a persuasion roll  liam plus plus zero  sam you still have my inspiration  laura inspiration plus ten  liam singing scanlan make you feel good  kit 15  matt 15 the tension in the muscles eventually relaxes and the head hangs i know not for what  reason i live  kit you seem a capable fighter yes my cousin recently became member of the slayers take in  vasselheim perhaps you would care to go find purpose in testing your skills there /none/  laura and if not there you can always fight in the crucible  matt grunts  kit they look for nothing but strength and honor  matt at which point theres a large cracking sound as the hardened foam breaks from one leg  grunts breaks the other leg free and stands there now before you  marisha your purpose in life is only what you make of it  sam you can do anything you could be president of the united states  orion while this is going on im writing on a piece of scroll right now /none/ which i give to him  matt i will walk and i will think perhaps i will drown and he turns and starts walking  towards the shoreline on the other side to the west  taliesin lillith does this mean you are free from those who are hunting you  kit im very much afraid not this is but one of the attempts my sisters have made to find me  however i have no intention of returning to my home  marisha and what was the name of your homeland again it sounded very exotic  kit palac /none/ lusterka is the seat of my family we go back very long way but i would not recommend  that you visit there its not the most cheerful place  orion not touristfriendly  kit not particularly welcome no  laura ive heard some terrible things about what is it your father is it or is it your  uncle your uncle  kit my family in general have interesting attitudes towards affection shall we say my  sisters well you see im not particularly cut out for making a good first impression however  my sisters did always tell /none/ me that what was inside was most important they did tell me this as they  were removing intestines to divine with them so perhaps maybe not usual meaning of this phrase  but zahra is perhaps the member of my family that i like best  laura understandably  marisha we all have those  liam all we care about is deeds youve proven yourself to great depth today  kit i believe in this circumstance i pale to my present company ive heard many wonderful things  about you from zahra and im honored to not only have /none/ met you but also to have had your aid in  this matter im profoundly grateful if there is ever any opportunity at which i can return the  favor i am not useful for much but perhaps a little smoke and mirrors i can do  orion i would actually like to know how you keep your horns so shiny and clean  matt the cold wind picks up as the night air begins to darken a distant storm blowing over the  horizon to the northeast the time draws late and cold  marisha lillith would you like /none/ to stay the night before you move on  kit if i would not put you at any  laura not even a little  marisha please have dinner with us  kit then it would be my pleasure  laura and we head back to the keep  marisha and i go in the back into the garden and i take the glissfoil out of my pocket that i was  given and i revive it from its dried state that it was given to me in  and plant it in the ground  matt all right  /none/ liam and as the twins are walking i say clearly im eating shit here today i guess im going to  make a promise not to stray from your side  laura remember that promise  liam i promise  sam i lick tiberius  laughter  orion thats what that feels like  matt that will be our freezeframe credit highfive for the evening  travis nice job kit  cheering  matt thank you so much kit for guesting with us

of this random drawing and the winner was a david kingsbury who won the opportunity to  provide the name and essence of an npc in our campaign the broker is actually their  construction  kit thats amazing  matt the broker was designed by one of our viewers one of our critters  taliesin thank you for the target practice  kit /none/ thank you so much  marisha that is so cool  kit thats amazing  matt were hoping to do stuff like that every now and then in the future to bring in some critters  to throw their creative mind in here and incorporate a character into our world my hearts  been going a mile a minute that entire game because no dm wants to have to kill a player  marisha i was on the verge of bawling my eyes out  liam if i ever died i thought and i still think ill probably be the /none/ first but if i ever  died i thought it would be more like a bus accident i would just go impact and thatd be  it i didnt think the doctor would look at me and say im sorry you have one week to live and the  whole week ive been sweating  matt yeah its pretty harsh the internet was very vocal  liam yeah thanks guys for putting the pressure on  matt oh man well that was awesome  end of
