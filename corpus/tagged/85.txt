none	 know how youre going to get through it without so much xanax and horse tranquilizers  matt you hit the nail on the head there its more the nerves of knowing that theres a lot of  people watching live at home and hearing a lot of people watching it live right there having the  space and having to finagle the stage to work so that were all still comfortable playing and also  people can watch it weve got some unique challenges but preparing for it i am  legitimately terrified  audience member we love you youre

none	 with a gangster as far as he knew in the beginning he didnt know  shit about her he never cared about gods and didnt trust magic didnt trust religion didnt  know anything about religion now hes faithful now hell probably always be a little weirded out  by it but i think he has the feeling of kinship with her now but he doesnt talk about it  matt i think the rest of that question was how do you feel no not yet how do you feel the  dynamics changed based on the original choice was 
none	 to anyway  cheering  audience member we can see your ankles  laughter  brian they have probably never seen your ankles or feet you might have shaquille onealsized feet  matt as far as the original deal was made to save vaxs life  liam my sister is vex  brian is critrolestats in the room  audience yes  brian ah write it down  cheering  brian critrolestats by the way  matt there are only two people responsible for that confusion  cheering  brian as i said on talks tuesday night matt and i 
none	 we had to have a talk because no pun intended  but no characters with one letter off names the next campaign can we set a rule so this doesnt  happen again  matt they can do it theyre just going to die in the first session  brian yeah exactly andrew hasnt seen his wife in six months hes been counting the number of  times we fucked up your name  marisha is it the same with 14 syllable names percy  taliesin oh im bringing it way down my next ones easy  brian youre going

none	 child can not come with you  laura travis didnt realize i brought my whole giant ass bag of dice i didnt bring my dice tray  because i wanted to bring my dice bag instead  brian oh my gosh its a serious problem hey whats your name  jessica im jessica aka shandravdeg im one of the admins for the critical role facebook group  i wanted to let you guys know that last night we hit 25000 members  cheering  brian give the url whats the url for it in case these people havent found it 
none	 yet  jessica facebookcomgroupscriticalrolefanclub  brian awesome how many  jessica 25000  brian thank you guys  jessica this is for anyone who wants to answer it outside of the show what is the best thing  that has happened because of the show whoever wants to take it  cheering  matt you guys i mean the community you guys have built around this our show in my opinion  has taken a backseat to the good that you guys put out there amongst yourselves and other people im  always happy to be a small little sparking 
tavern	 point for that its gotten so much larger than anything  we do now thats really incredible i think  liam can we get a show of hands how many people in this room started playing dungeons  dragons  after having watched critical role there you go there is your answer right there  applause  brian wow thank you thank you so much  rey hi im rey from inaudible last night im here inaudible  brian oh man that guy was also drunk last night gencon baby go ahead  rey my question is for matt i 
none	 really want to know why did jarett get kicked out of marquet  matt the games not over yet thats a good question but i dont know whats going to happen  if that ever comes up in the story line i dont want to spoil it here when the campaigns over i  do want to do a retrospective qa a lot of inaudible campaign were started and never came  to fruition as you all know happens a lot in role playing games we can talk about things that  arent going to impact necessarily the next campaign 
none	 you can ask those questions and i can  go i can tell you now  brian yeah were going to do a full cast plus matt retrospective on the campaign after probably  like a very extended talks episode or something like inaudible talk for critical role yeah  laura yeah but some of the things that you still wont be able to answer because well still be in  the same world  matt yeah inaudible  laura jarett got kicked out for being too damn fine  matt i said not to spoil it  brian okay 
none	 whos next thank you  audience member i am meepsandsheeps  brian oh nice  audience member my husband is inaudible  brian oh yeah he always asks really great questions tell him i say hey and stay turnt  oh thats you whats up dude how are you come get a pin from rachel be careful though she can  be mean whats your question  audience member well my question is for matt if you were to have an npc of a flumph what would  said flumph sound like  matt oh man thats going to be 
none	 a messy one i think its going to sound something like  sam oh hello its nice to meet you  matt marishas dwarf  laura so hes celestial  matt id imagine it would be something like hi i want to come with you guys they seem like the  dnd blobfish just this wonderful flat creature if you dont know what im talking about dont  know what a flumph is look it up oh yeah that sounds like a flumph  liam its like the inside of an oyster much bigger and floating on a inaudible  
none	 matt flumph noises thank you for that  brian sounds like laura when shes hungry  laughter  audience member i want to thank matt for the retweet last night for the larkin sign my phone  died pretty much from all the twitter notifications for whoever wants to jump in first  new campaign means new characters is anyone going to try to top the majesty that is cock lightning  for an intro  laughter  brian were going to have to have someone with machine gun boobs that shoot lightning  sam the next intro should be 
none	 all of us doing various forms of cock lightning just come walking  out of a room explosion sound  taliesin in a circle and the lightning rises in the middle  sam inaudible cross the streams  matt most awkward episode of captain planet ever  travis all our hands are up like a roller coaster  liam thats how they sealed up the chained oblivion  brian oh my god we have only been here for 23 minutes and my stomach hurts from laughing you  guys are amazing whats your name  cj hi my name is 
none	 cj inaudible on twitter my question is for taliesin sorry im a little  nervous with vexahlia getting more interested with pelor and percys experience with ioun and  this overall vecna arc is he possibly going to be more interested in deities overall  taliesin no ill say hes come to terms with his place and what that will actually mean may come  out in the next few episodes or not hes definitely not seeking the approval really he  definitely figured out that there is something that he does have admiration for while hes mildly  irritated 
none	 but hes not that mad it didnt love him back no he walked out of there going well  thats just fine  laughter  taliesin if it had been anybody other than scanlan but because it was scanlan he was like  i dont care fine this is so dumb  marisha this end of the table is team nonexalted  taliesin yeah  cheering  brian inaudible  taliesin he doesnt have animosity towards it but its definitely not his thing hes figured  out that hes just not cut out for it good question though  cj 
none	 thank you  brian thank you hey whats your name  will my name is will this is a forwardlooking question one thing we have seen in the world of  exandria is the development both magical inaudible and airships but also  technologytechnology my question is once the current campaign ends tonight in a tpk  laughter  will when the new campaign begins after the timeskip how do you see those trends continuing to develop if you  have time for an incharacter question i wanted to ask some of the technologically minded  characters to talk about 
none	 what inspires them to do what they do taliesins percy sams  tary and matts npcs like dr ripley and victor  matt right  liam okay everyone have a seat for the radio play that will be the rest of the panel  brian yeah we might need to sell tickets for that question  matt yeah thats actually a great question and could be a much longer discussion ill try to  keep it precise much like for instance oilbased gasolines fossil fuels we have  technology that far exceeds what inaudible whoever controls the technology can control 
none	 the  rate at which it expands and is used i think its a very similar circumstance that people who can  create highend magic technology also very strongly control the use of it to the best of  their benefit both monetarily and for political power that is very much how i see that it is  controlled through exandria i dont see necessarily a perpetual kind of coming singularity  if you will of magical technology in exandria to where it would rapidly change in the next  campaign you may see elements of it used more often 
none	 as far as more mundane technology thats  going to be interesting because that is a threat in the hands of the common man being able to do  what a mage could possibly do with years of training then you have this atodds circumstance  of technology that empowers the little man versus those that should be in power from their mindset  so im curious to see where that goes  sam in character as tary doty take this down i have an idea for a hat that holds two bottles of  aerated wine with a tube 
none	 into my mouth so that i could always be lubricated also put this down  just as a note a 56k baud dialup modem  laughter  taliesin sadly percys answer would actually be a spoiler at this point im going to have to hold  that if i die well have a conversation about it but if i dont die then ill save it  liam oh okay follow up question does scanlan worry about the mass weaponization of cock  lightning and it being in the wrong hands across the world  matt i think its called the 
none	 baby arms race  applause  brian thats taldorable  groans laughter  eric my names eric matt  brian what boots are these dont get kicked by this guy hes got spikes on them  eric matt your show is the best you are such a wonderful storyteller there will be brawl is  amazing when is there going to be a sequel  laughter  matt oh man for those that havent seen there will be brawl its a webseries that i directed  and cocreated back in 2008 or 2009  brian its on youtube  matt 
none	 on youtube super low budget its a live action film noir hbo crime drama version of  nintendos smash brothers universe  eric its every bit as ridiculous as it sounds and its wonderful  matt well thank you i was really proud of it it took itself super seriously and thats what was  wonderful about it donning costumes and prosthetics i played ganondorf in it anyway  that process almost killed me  eric because you dont have enough free time as it is  matt exactly a sequel oh man well say if somehow a crazy windfall 
none	 were to hit and the rest  of the industry burned down and im like i got nothing else better to do then yeah maybe a  sequel right now im a little busy we had plans for a sequel but it never quite came to fruition  we had a prequel too with the actual kirby murders because kirby in our universe is a  cannibalistic killer he wants to eat people and wear their skin hats when he eats sonic where  does that come from thats his scalp good question  eric whats your favorite 16bit rpg 
none	  brian no second questions plus that was too close to the one at comic con they asked 8bit  16bit jrpg at comic con right  audience yeah  brian we all got shit for answers hello whats your name  rasheek hello my name is rasheek im from czech republic  brian you came all the way out here awesome here you get traviss name tag  cheers applause  rasheek my question is for travis i have some czech beer do you want some  sam yes  rasheek czech beer  travis man fuck yes  
none	 laughter cheering  travis its just kool aid and pilsner  brian thank you so much  sam that is the best question we have ever been asked  brian thank you so much  brian what is your name look at that outfit how long did that take to put together  ashley i dont know  brian okay whats your name  ashley im ashley  brian thats a beautiful name just tilt it down  ashley i cant  ashley im ashley im the raven queen my question is for matt i was wondering when the  
none	 raven queen was ascending to godhood was it her intention to be the goddess of death and replace  the old god or was that an accident  matt i will say that what the myth and lore that currently exists of the age of arcana speaks many  of the poems and stories say it was intentional out of eventual distrust and disapproval of the  god who at the time held the portfolios whereas previously the individual whose name has been  scrubbed from history who held that office if you will the portfolios was destroyed because she 
town	  felt that she could do a much better job  applause  audience member i have two things if you will indulge me for a moment  brian and travis maybe  audience member hey crowd you want to join me on this magic carpet ride on the count of three if  we could all say fuck you brian foster one two three  audience fuck you brian foster  brian can we do one more for my instagram i dont want to make this all about me one two three  audience fuck you brian foster  
none	 brian my mom will love that okay i can indulge another one then  audience member matt and marisha congratulations again question taliesin you have said before  that percy is a few bad decisions away becoming a villain  taliesin yeah  audience member now after the vecna fight if vexahlia were to die because  laura how dare you  audience member delilah has something for vexahlia for some reason that finger of death  has always targeted you for some reason i dont know why should she die will that be the last  straw or the 
none	 last tipping point for percy that might make him go crazy because he is a mad scientist  taliesin there is naturally an answer to that and i am not answering it here inaudible i have  thought about that there is an answer to that  brian thank you so much youre really funny hey whats your name i wasnt saying that  sarcastically either  audience member inaudible i wanted to say thank you im sure i speak for everyone for everything  that you have done matt and everyone on the cast i appreciate it by inaudible 
none	 i drove 14 hours  to come here  brian no way where from  audience member boston  brian shoutout to boston  audience member go patriots  brian anyway you can ask your related question  audience member you guys are probably going to say no because i missed the signing thing and i  have the inaudible poster with me  brian yeah the only reason that i am going to be the bad cop here only because we get thousands of  tweets every time we do a con from somebody thats like my grandmother fell 
town	 when the tickets  were on sale and her life alert the battery was dead and we just cant unfortunately we cant  do inaudible  laura its very specific  brian yeah but if you give me 150 i will no im sorry did you have a question though  matt if you see any of us wandering the hall very discreetly nudge our shoulder and say need  you to sign this hoping to get out of the middle of this crowd here and well try to do that  brian yeah thats actually a really good tip 
none	 matt if you see somebody and you want to say hi  or whatever just be really quiet hey can you sign this because if you are like highpitched  scream oh my god its matthew mercer you have a thousand girls with a mccree body pillow come out  laughter applause  matt as mccree he is not kidding  audience member my question kind of ties into the last question taliesin would that or something  push you to make you use that contract  taliesin i am aware that the contract exists ive read it  marisha 
none	 you creep me out sometimes you freak me out because every once in a while youre like  frodo with the ring every once in a while you pull it out and you just stare at it inaudible  i swear to god all the time youll be like inaudible  liam if you make it to the end of this campaign and resist pulling that trigger i will be impressed  taliesin yes  liam inaudible  taliesin ill be impressed make it to the end of the game without pulling it  liam any week now any week 
none	  laura we have another raven queen  brian yes whats your name  brittany im brittany i actually only drove like 20 minutes to be here  laughter  travis shoutout 20 minutes  brittany actually i have something from the raven queen for her paladin as well as something  for the rest of you guys i apologize i am hoping theyre good luck charms i have a skull for each  of you  laura a skull youre going to give us a skull  brittany my question is for marisha i dont play too many druids 
none	 but i love them because they are  badass in general what is your favorite spell and whats a spell you wish you had that you dont have  marisha oh oh i mean i am a little partial to feeblemind thats pretty great call lightning is  a goto classic keyleth favorite i wish i had counterspell  marisha inaudible  matt that spell is bullshit  laughter cheering  audience member vecna used it  brian hey whats your name  kat thank you there is only 15000 of us in here my name is kat my question 
none	 is for marisha  and taliesin will the whitestone industrial revolution be environmentalist  taliesin actually yes  marisha we have the stocks  taliesin we have the stocks no i think that a lot of just to make it a little quicker than the  way i discussed it a bit with matt a lot of how technology evolves is usually due to either  warfare or desperate need when you have magic in play there are a lot of things that you just  dont need so you dont really build it i think a lot of it 
none	 is going to be trying to find cheap  easy ways of doing things without magic that are not complicated and not natural which is why we  are doing the steampowered heating that we are putting in whitestone its quite useful  marisha yeah he has a plan for steamheated roads so that the snow will melt and not clog up  the roads which is great  kat you dont have to answer but can percy make anything nice and uncomplicated  taliesin what  brian can you make anything nice and complicated  kat uncomplicated  taliesin 
none	 no there will be a specific answer to that if he lives as well  brian hey voice actors talk into the mic by the way its amazing with these guys  how often you have to tell them but you have to tell them that and they do this  for a living im just kidding whats your name  audience member im inaudible valianteffort matt you mentioned before that you said that you  had the chroma conclave arc planned for two years how much of that has evolved into the vecna arc  going into that how 
none	 much of all of that specifically did you have planned  matt oh man i knew that i wanted vecna to be the final villain if we ever made it this far into the  campaign because he is just your classic dnd villain that i never had the opportunity to do  and inaudible since that is has kind of been building up to this arc and recently coming to  realize that i am going to have to represent vecna in front of a lot of people who have a lot of  expectations with this character  
none	 audience member you are doing great  matt aww thank you  audience member vecna stand up  laughter applause  matt like any major arc those dms out there can attest to this you build out the structure in a  basic narrative arc until you get to that point you flesh out change things based on where the  story goes things you can tie into it like oh it would be cool if this worked i didnt have  the whole thing plotted out i had the basic three act structure set as they played through  
none	 whitestone as they played through the chroma conclave arc as things began to happen it began  to solidify my idea of how to bring elements back in and also try and make it different than  previous arcs that have been played the conclave was very much a cataclysm has happened now its  trying to rebuild and eventually when youre ready you go after the villain this is a very different  circumstance the cataclysm is coming but you dont know when and you dont know whats going  to happen i wanted to mix it up a 
none	 little bit  brian great question hey whats your name  hannah hannah x hi guys quick question  brian great shirt it says whitestone  hannah whitestone everything is totally fine inaudible de rolo quick question for the  significant others travislaura marishamatt sam and liam after a game when you guys get  whispers because this has happened to me where the dm is plotting against myself my husband  are you interrogating each other in the car like what the eff was that all about why wont you  tell me what the whisper was about come 
none	 on tell me  laughter  travis i dont say shit no we dont spoil it even recently when we all left the room and it  was just liam and matt i have not gone back and watched what was said  laura no none of us know  travis we dont want to know  marisha yeah thats true  hannah laura level up dicers  marisha i will say that there are a lot of times that people think that whenever matt almost every  game they are like aww shit marishas going to make matt sleep 
none	 on the couch tonight it never happens  matt its good for the back posture  travis i was in genuine trouble after making trinket run through that minefield  laura he really was  travis everybody left the door closed then the face that turned to me  matt that is burned in my memory that is the day i learned never cross laura bailey  travis shell kill me in my sleep  liam it took you that long  matt look youve known her longer than i have that was my moment  brian that night travis 
none	 approached the taco bell with sad hulk music playing okay you look amazing  marisha yes  matt as gilmore no they dont they look glorious  cheering  winchester i am winchester currently partygilmore on twitter my question is for the  entire cast but mostly for laura bailey speaking of whispers some time ago you went snooping in my  room you found a box under the bed you found letters in the box you never told us what was in  those letters and i would like to know if you would tell us what what was 
tavern	 in those letters  laughter  laura i never told anyone did i i dont know can i tell they were love letters between  gilmore and his first boyfriend they were really sweet  winchester thats all i needed thank you  applause  brian inaudible  marisha party gilmore you didnt get a pin catch  brian youre drunk get over here  matt okay take it  sabina hey kiki  marisha inaudible sun tree  cheering  laura that is amazing  taliesin oh my god  sabina my name is sabina i am from michigan 
none	 as you guys might not know i met matt and marisha  last night its a question for all of you but its super quick if you could put your characters  into a hogwarts house what house would it be matt your characters are allura and gilmore sam  both tary and scanlan  brian tary and the other guy  matt ill say allura is ravenclaw most definitely i would probably put gilmore in  gryffindor borderline hufflepuff but more gryffindor im hufflepuff by the way  laura i am also hufflepuff i would put vex i have 
none	 seen a lot of people put her in slytherin  okay its a toss up between gryffindor and slytherin inaudible dont shake your head  audience member im a slytherin  laura what  audience member im a slytherin  laura okay  audience member im a gryffindor it all works out  liam vax is gryffindor  laura hide  liam i dont know im in either ravenclaw or hufflepuff  laura hufflepuff  audience debating  brian okay we need to move on from this harry potter i love harry potter but we got to keep moving  
none	 sam i dont know anything about harry potter shit so i am going to say scanlan is team valor  and tary is instinct  cheers applause  taliesin ravenclaw for percy  marisha im confused i feel like they asked the question and people have answered it in four  different ways marisha is ravenclaw keyleth would probably be hufflepuff  travis i am in slytherin but i think grog would probably get kicked out so he would just be  hagrids understudy  applause  sabina thank you all so much you are amazing  brian youre amazing 
none	 inaudible that was great hey whats your name dont forget to get a pin  from rachel there whats your name man  audience member hi im inaudible i was at the live show last year and i loved it laura since  you forgot your dice tray im sure if you went down row 2500 in the exhibit hall to the wyrmwood  booth im sure they would loan you one my question what  brian do you work for them or is that just free advertisement very sly  audience member free advertising i was going to ask 
none	 matt about raven queen patronage for blood  hunters but i am going to give some love to the nameless man between marisha and brian  brian inaudible you drop your wallet every panel comic con san diego wondercon i have  picked up your wallet  audience member if you were to dm a one shot what genre would it be like horror like liam or  something more fun or lighthearted or maybe even like magical girl  travis oh man you are giving me way too much credit i have no idea it would be some stream 
none	  of consciousness bullshit inaudible  taliesin you have never heard of blood bowl have you  travis no  taliesin like that schwarzenegger film where you kill everyone in a video game except its football  travis oh my god id do that then i would make all the characters play their vox machina  characters and i would find a way for vax to die immediately  liam id just get back up again  travis i know  brian i get knocked down again thank you so much  matt stress ball vox machina style  brian 
none	 hello  hans im hans inaudible on twitter my question is for brian and matt how long until  brian gets to guest on critical role  applause  brian can i answer this okay i talk about this sometimes on reddit i feel weird the after show  guy being on the show like if you saw not to compare myself to chris hardwick but if you saw  him walking around on the walking dead some of you may be like aww thats funny but the rest of you  would be like i hate this i like 
none	 to watch it as a fan i am also not a voice actor or an actor  so i feel like that is part of the excuse is that you all are voice actors and jon heder i dont  know sam can we make an announcement  sam it puts a lot of pressure on me i will be running a oneshot in a week and a half  cheers applause  sam one of my special guests is young brian foster  cheers applause  brian inaudible as close to a critical role oneshot thing  hans i 
none	 have to ask a follow up in that oneshot will you play a cabbage farmer named larkin  brian i cannot answer that question thank you whats your name  christine my name is christine i am really nervous i left fenthras over there i was afraid  to run into people with it  matt you are now unattuned  laughter  christine it happens thank you guys so much for doing what you do i have a question for mostly  laura and maybe matt ever since that episode with fenthras and saundor i have been thinking what 
none	  would have had happened if vex had gone with him would she have gone like evil galadriel or what  would have happened  laura you can say hes dead anyways  matt to be fair shortly after the episode i filmed the episode of gm tips about notes and the  internet zoomed in really close to my sheet and found out elements of it its not super secret  laura he told me this like right after inaudible  matt yeah because at that point you couldnt get it so i was like oops  laura inaudible 
none	  matt both would have been interesting things the heart of the tree would have taken her into this  embrace and she would have been turned into a fey creature she would have partially bark skin much  like saundor had it would have given her a bonus to her armor class a couple other things it  would have given her a few other bonuses but i cant remember all the things more general fey  abilities and such  laura like it gives inaudible right  matt yeah but also gives you vulnerability to fire  laura 
none	 which would have been real bad going into the  matt thordak fight plus you would have had saundor as a patron which would have been real interesting  laura yeah that would have sucked  matt when i was designing that my thought was that probably wont be long term because yeah  laura if i would have gotten with saundor would i be dead right now would vex have been gone by now  matt i dont know if you would have been dead but you would have been a very different person  laura ugh  matt 
none	 i dont know if any of the percy stuff would have happened  marisha inaudible you dont want male aggression as your patron  cheers applause  matt i didnt expect you to choose it but i had a backup just in case you did it would have been  its own unique interesting character arc for you i like what you did i like what you chose  laura me too  christine laura i also bought dice in your honor  sam this next cosplay is so good  cheers applause  audience member hello everyone i have 
none	 a question for brian because i keep hassling him about it on twitter  brian okay  audience member im a huge brian w foster fan and since yall support each other i thought you  brian yall both of you  audience member brian has an ep on itunes called odessa and its amazing and you should listen to  it he also has the book blackened white which im going to get him to sign tomorrow i would  like for you to sing for us brian everyone knows inaudible  brian oh man what do you want 
none	 me to sing  audience member preferably just the beginning of the wine  brian oh man okay what are the lyrics this is an old one the beginning of it ♫ tommy  ♫ barlo relieved of his sorrow theres blood on the roadway where he died ♫  applause  brian inaudible ♫ every word you ever spoke thirty years in silence smashing stones holding  ♫ onto holy roses ♫  applause  brian you wait over here and ill sign that book  liam matt matt matt how do i kill vecna  matt dont tell 
none	 him anything  travis we only have four minutes left so we have to lightning round  laura seriously go check out odessa because inaudible  ethan hi im ethan this is for mr mercer if this violates the gm no note things that you have  just tell me and ill ask later back in the sunken tomb episode when vex had that temporary  leave of absence you said something to kash along the lines of if you revive her then you might  draw veshs attention did you have any sort of mechanics in play for that 
none	 or was that flavor text  matt well flavor text theres a difference between mechanics and story elements that you will  then bring mechanics in for i hadnt plotted that to happen i didnt expect her to die i didnt  think to plan ahead in case kashaw resurrected her in the spur of the moment that made sense  and then words happened then it would have brought vesh more towards the story more than she  currently is vesh is an interesting god that may be in future books who is not in the  taldorei guide 
none	 because vesh and the relationship to kashaw is more based in another continent  eventually the system will be expanded  brian lightning round whos up  danielle hi my name is danielle my question is for matt one of the great things about being a dm  is we get to come up with lots of characters while pcs only get to play one if you could pick one  character who you have played as an npc to carry as your own pc in another campaign who would it be  matt ooh man yeah thats a lot 
none	 to pick from no victor is fun for short bursts for a long  term campaign someone who is interesting and a little bit different from myself senokir would be  great as senokir because this is how he would be speaking the entire time  laura then you would be able to see the other side of senokir that would be so cool  matt as senokir that would be a lot of fun  brian okay this is going to be the last question because over here someone just put a blow dart in my  audience member 
none	 my question is for mercer as a fellow dm  brian little closer to the mic so everyone can hear you  audience member as a fellow dm this is directed at mr mercer when you have a neartpk or  potentially have a tpk how do you deal with that i noticed that a lot  travis why are you asking that tonight  marisha all these people inaudible  brian okay lets go speed it up speed it up because we got to wrap up  audience member how do you deal with that i know that there 
none	 is a lot of anger is there like a  pizza party at the end to hopefully mend relationships  matt well one of the roles of a gm is a therapist in a lot of ways when things happen  you have to be emotionally available for those players to help them through it and other players  in the game as well if a character dies or if its a tpk you have to prepare to like all  right guys im going to take us out for drinks we are going to have a little wake for 
none	 the party  if the party feels really attached to characters and you dont want to actually ruin their lives  you can try to think of story elements to bring them back like all of a sudden they wake up as  undead in the control of this mage and now the campaign is to try to shed the shackles of undead  or perhaps the inaudible brings them over into another plane when their souls were to traverse  but theres something wrong when their souls go to another plane now their story is being in the  
none	 spirit realm fighting you continue the story and the players are really connected and you feel like  they got robbed of a proper end if you think they are mature enough to handle it then you buy them  some drinks  brian thank you all for coming out give these guys a round of applause  applause cheering  elevator music
