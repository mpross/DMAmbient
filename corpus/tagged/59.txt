dung	 marisha and i cast my skywrite spell ew i just spit and i use the smoke in the distance and as  its rising up into the sky start drawing out the de rolo family crest in the smoke  matt okay you begin to take the plume of smoke and filter into the dark rain clouds and you make  the smoke go to a thicker thicker black and take the next few moments to begin sculpting in the air  until eventually we have a very welldefined de rolo crest now staring down at the entire city of 
none	  whitestone  sam oh somethings happening somethings happening in the sky  marisha thats me  sam i think its a magic wielder of some sort something i must flee  laughter  matt all right investigation checks from both of you  laura okay  travis did i find anything on smashface  liam sighs thats what you rolled the last time  laura i know  taliesin 16  laura ive got to put this one away for a while  matt what did you roll  laura i rolled a nine  matt okay the two 
none	 of you take a while upstairs looking about the rooms you manage to acquire  from just some of the local bits of cabinets and dust you gather about 230 gold pieces  laura 230  matt just loose gold pieces that are around there is a nice jewelry box that seems to contain  most of the jewels and gems that this individual likes  laura im going to take the whole jewelry box and sort through it later  matt okay so say a box of tylieris jewelry would be what youve marked down  taliesin tylieri family 
none	 jewels  laughter  taliesin that wont be confusing at all  matt there you go you do notice however thats all youre able to find for the most part other than  some few bits of clothing and outfit the master bedroom has no bed  laura does he sleep in a coffin  taliesin were going to finish searching downstairs and then find the entrance to the  matt okay  liam id like to wind my way up there as well  matt okay as you make your way up there you notice them stepping out  
none	 liam yeah im still curious i want to go have a look as well  matt go for it investigation  laura thats better thank you  liam 16  matt 16 you look through the room most everything of interest has already been picked  clean this room also doesnt seem to see much use other than the clothing thats in there this room  is used for dressing and presentational purposes but other than that as a bedroom its pretty  useless as you guys go downstairs well say for the sake of brevity you take a little 
town	 bit of time  to start looking through you know youre a little pressed for time because you can feel the energy  in the town begin to rise and you start hearing noises you keeping an eye out  marisha yeah  matt the people that rush into the rooms are now rushing back out some of them wearing leather  tunics and small bits of armor their weapons gathered and theyre forming small bands  marisha i come over the speakers once again the ear pieces i think its time to go whenever you  guys are ready 
none	 i want to light this bitch up  travis we need to check all the rooms that go downstairs first  marisha all right quick  travis got an empty house i run out to the door to the left to the uncovered areas  matt okay you go over to this hallway you eventually smash the door doesnt take too long  it leads into what looks like a small study or some sort of an office room a big blue rug a  desk with a chair some papers strewn about  travis can i grab the rug 
none	 and yank it  matt yeah pull the rug off reveals a hatch  travis excited shouting i found a hatch  laura cries out in pain no need to yell  travis oh sorry quieter i found a hatch  taliesin quick i just want to do a quick round of the downstairs room before going to the hatch  matt okay glancing about you find what looks to be a general sitting area a music room or a  place where you would host guests also in fair disuse and then beyond that you find a room thats 
none	  pretty bland with a staircase that leads down into what was once servants quarters that has  been converted into a torture room  laura oh lovely  matt its a little nicer in its presentation and tools than the duergar torture room that you  encountered in the underdark but this looks to be like tylieri had a definite interest in  entertaining unwanted guests  taliesin okay  travis vax or vex will you come check this hatch for boobies  laughter  liam i jog on down  matt all right make a perception check  
dung	 liam yeah thats a 23  matt yeah it does not appear to be trapped  travis no boobies  liam okay you want to open that big guy  travis yeah growls  matt vroom the hatch comes up there is no ladder its just a tenfoot drop down into a  basement  travis okay i jump  matt land down there a 20 foot by 20 foot room its very musty however you do see in the far  corner there is a pad of fresh earth set up and there is a dark box  travis 
none	 um  matt about eight feet long  liam i hear him say um and i jump down too with the flametongue dagger out for light  matt okay the room lights up a little bit and you can see across the way there is a not  superdetailed but a fairly wellcrafted coffin on the opposite side of the room  travis ooh i bet theres treasure in there  liam you might be right yeah lets go have a look  laura is there treasure did you find treasure  liam hold please perception check the coffin thats 
none	 a 20  matt okay the coffin does not appear to be trapped  travis can i open it  marisha he said that with a question mark  matt its always fun to do that  travis well should i just smash it  liam i really feel like this could be  laura smash it  travis three two grog smashes  liam i kick it off with the end of my foot little bit or try to  matt okay boof the lid flies off and then slams on the ground a smell hits you thats just 
none	  like musty old mildewed earth the inside of the coffin is its lined with like a fine purplish  velvet material the smell quickly fades it looks like there are some small baubles in there  keepsakes there is what looks to be a cape or a cloak that is laid across the bottom of this for  comfort  liam roll it up put it into my satchel im going to take a dagger out and i want to cut all  the way up through that purple velvet just see just in case  matt okay you 
none	 cut through the purple velvet rummage through underneath it appears to be the  back of the box  taliesin im going to check his desk upstairs for anything interesting  matt okay want to make an investigation check  taliesin natural 20  matt as youre rummaging through the notes in the desk a lot of them are ledgers involving the  trade in and out of the city he has his hands dabbling in elements of the timber trade elements  of the actual trade of whitestone he talks about the and you understand the reason that  
none	 whitestone itself is the stone thats mined here is so popular for construction and architecture  and other elements is the stone that these mountains are made of when properly prepared  there is a faint bit of residuum that is naturally ingrained in the rock here no one really knows  how it came about but whatever it is while it is not inherently magical it makes it a little bit  easier faster and cheaper to enchant the stone so when it comes to you know enchanting a  teleportation circle permanently somewhere or for traps or things 
none	 not actual objects but actually  enchanting anything made of stonework its easier to enchant and thats why the whitestone of this  area is sought after and a good trade element so theres notes about that but the stone trade has  been halted all stone has continued to be mined but its not being transported  travis is the desk made out of the stone  matt no theres just notes about it so all the whitestone that is being mined is not being  exported its being kept here somewhere  laura theyre making something big  
none	 taliesin theyre making something big  liam i think we need to get out of here  travis i was going to ask are you good with the coffin  liam yeah  travis okay i smash the shit out of it in an effort to see whats underneath  matt okay you take about 30 seconds of extreme violence against the wooden coffin killing it  into chunks and blocks you get the feeling that this may have been the place the mist was  trying to get to but it did not make its journey it got scattered 
none	 by druid sunbeam and destroyed  and the coffin is left in ruins you do even you grog absorb the fact that when a vampire goes to  mist form you get the feeling that this is the home it needs to come to to try and survive  travis not anymore  matt not anymore not that one  marisha do i see anyone coming  matt oh you see another zombie giant coming up the way you can see people attacking it its  just thrashing them about but this one seems less bothered by the group and 
none	 is now moving towards a  specific area moving towards the fiery plume in the distance theyre all gathering in that  direction  marisha but no one seems to be rushing towards this house  matt not at the moment no  travis this ones not on fire yet  matt all right you all gather you can hear the rainstorm itself is coming down in sheets what  do you want to do  travis light this candle  laura should we light this on fire too  taliesin burn it to the ground  marisha everyone out 
none	 and i start casting a flaming sphere  matt okay  travis were out by now  marisha everyone out  matt you guys all step out into the rain whooshes pouring down what bits of guard blood  that have been pressed against you washes off  travis aw  marisha i peek in this foyer and just boof right in the middle and take a minute to  move it all around  matt a flaming sphere begins to corkscrew around this room up over the banister up to the upper  area and like an artist you 
none	 paint this entire room with flame until the entire interior of this  main foyer is just an inferno you can hear the flames licking and the light is very bright you  end up backing up and you can see people unarmored folk in nearby homes that are pressed up  against their windows watching this happen and whispering to each other the children those that  are kept guarded and are not part of this rebellion they are watching this with smiles  marisha okay i think thats good enough lets go  taliesin head back to the 
none	 curiosity shop  laura yeah sneaky stealthing  matt okay as you guys run off into the alley behind  laura pass without a trace i cast on all of us  matt okay how many more spells do you have at that level because you used it several times  today  laura yeah im fine with pass without a trace thats a 1stlevel 2ndlevel but im fine  taliesin back to the alcove then  matt you guys all dart off into the alley under the cover of the shadows of the storm and the  rainfall to 
none	 head towards the alcove and well go ahead and take a quick break  cheering  matt a quick break i know i always say that im not going to say five minutes but  sam this ones a real quick break  matt well take it real quick because we want to try and get through as much of the story before we  get to critmas  laura critmas  liam critmas crimmas  taliesin oh dear god  travis its going to be a thing  matt which is going to which is going to take some 
none	 time tonight be back here in a few minutes  guys well see you in a sec  travis pizza  break  matt welcome back so jumping back into the chaos the party has scattered back into the  rainstorm i would like everyone to make a stealth check  laura oh right plus ten for everybody  matt plus ten  liam i did all right  taliesin i rolled my disadvantage  travis does it matter on a one  matt all right  travis ten  matt total ten  travis total ten 11  laura 
none	 11 technically  matt okay  laura 29  liam 43  sam im not there  travis 43  matt well youre making your own stealth though youre invisible so just roll twice  sam natural 20  marisha 28  taliesin 30  matt okay so making up for the bounding chaos that is grog throughout the city you manage to  still make your way largely as a group stealthed to are you heading to the alcove you said  taliesin thats where we had our little crashbase set up right  matt correct all right you 
none	 make your way to the alcove as youre darting through you can see in  the distance small pocketed sounds of yells and the occasional sound of some sort of largescale  crumbling or crashing of wood and stone occasionally darting past the streets you see  militant occupants of whitestone armored rushing through shouting orders to each other some  coming back wounded and helping their friends back the midday rebellion has definitely started  and you get the sense that the initial surprise has been effective but the longer this runs the  longer this wears on the 
none	 more and more of a body count this will be  travis seeing the chaos can i get the dust of tracelessness and start trying to sprinkle it  behind us  matt yeah  marisha guys we should do something  laura i know we really should  sam am i with these guys yet  matt you have not but you all meet up back at the alcove communicating over your earpieces you  make your way to the front of the building the doors are closed and locked  liam the alcove  travis closed and locked 
none	  liam ill see about that im going to check the door  matt go for it  liam that is ten 23  matt okay seems to be a fairly simple lock  liam all right  travis look for an ambush around can we look around  laura yeah perceive it  travis rooftops sides of the building  matt make a perception check guys  marisha all of us  sam me too  matt not you you havent gotten there yet  liam 20  travis i actually rolled a 17  marisha 12  taliesin 
none	 24  laura 26  matt okay looking about there doesnt appear to be any set ambush or anybody else here you do  hear the soft sound of pacing footsteps in the interior  laura should we knock on the door  travis canvass the building  liam i can get in there and see who that is i can go in yeah  laura theyre right on the inside  liam i thought it was upstairs or you said right on the other side of the door  laura right on the other side of the door  
none	 marisha oh for crying out loud i push past them i just go jordana jordana its us  matt okay theres a pause and a voice goes whos us  laura oh crazy grandma  marisha and vox machina quietly does she know were called that  laura no i dont know louder crazy grandma was staying with you crazy peasants  marisha allies  matt make a persuasion check  marisha son of a nine  laura can i help  laura and marisha crazy grandma  marisha crazy grandma can help  matt ill say since youre backing 
none	 her failure up go ahead and make it with disadvantage  marisha hey you dont have to call it that sounds so sad when you say it like that  laura 18  matt 18 theres a pause crazy grandma come in you hear the sound of a locking sound and the  door opens up eversoslightly a very very dimly lit interior theres a small lantern a hooded  lantern across the room other than that you see the shadow of jordana as she ushers you all in out  of the rain  laura so hey guess what 
none	 its started  matt yeah apparently she closes the door behind you looks out the window that has the  curtains closed and goes okay so its underway its not safe to be here right now  laura no  matt did anyone see you come in  laura no no  matt good who are you  laura oh well how about seeming this whole time have we looked like  crazy peasants during the battle  matt and travis no  travis we dropped it  laura we dropped it  matt you dropped seeming before all of 
none	 this  laura okay just making sure trinket wasnt a donkey that killed the  matt no  taliesin that wouldve been intense and awesome  matt that wouldve been amazing donkey eating a vampire head aw man  liam this is hard to believe but this is crazy grandma  laura im crazy grandma i do a crazy eye thing just to show her  sam am i there matt  matt youve just now gotten to that point you see the door closing as you get there  sam hello hi howd it go  marisha good work 
none	 by the way that was awesome i mean i saw the fire i dont know what you did  laura so it went well  sam i set fire to the place some shit went down dinosaurs were harmed but i know you got the  smoke signal and used that to attack  marisha the de rolos have dinosaurs  sam no it was me its all good though i caused a ruckus thats all i was supposed to do  travis thats it yeah  matt what is going on  travis right  taliesin we may have 
none	 just started a revolution  marisha does he look familiar to you  liam you dont recognize us its not safe to walk these streets for outsiders so we were using  a little bit of trickery this is us were the same people you were dealing with before  travis vox machina  laura we just need to rest  matt okay you can rest here but how long  laura until were healed and then well go  liam overnight  matt all right  laura i feel like we should get word out to somebody though because 
none	  sam to what to hold the revolution  laura i feel like everybodys going to die before we even get to the castle  marisha thats the thing i dont know if this is the time to rest  laura but we dont have any spells  marisha im okay we can maybe make do  laura i cant make do  travis you might be cool but were fucked  taliesin how about we stay here until 400 500 in the morning  marisha what time is it now  matt right now id say youre close to 
none	 three in the afternoon  laura how do we tell the people to like hold off  sam we need to briefly quell the rebellion  marisha we started something we cant stop it now  taliesin were going to be indoors it doesnt matter what time we go to attack the castle  sam lets spread word we can spread word lets find a few  laura can we send off a message  marisha we sparked a hope in people we now have innocent peasants people who are not fighters  sam can you skywrite something like attack 
none	 tomorrow or hold  laura what if we all take off in separate directions and we tell all the peasants we find  that are fighting the time that were going to attack  travis arent there a bunch of zombie stone giants walking around  laura well yeah well have to be sneaky about it but well spread the rumors around i look at  jordana joanna  matt jordana  laura jordana and i say can you get word out to people  matt to a few maybe i dont want to go outside right now  laura 
town	 i dont blame you dear  taliesin lets let her stay i say we just rest up and we attack tonight  travis tonight  marisha what if there isnt a town to defend tonight  travis arent they stronger then  taliesin its going to be indoors anyway  sam first of all its raining outside its daytime theres no vampires out there right now  right they dont like water do they  laura no they dont like running water in fact they hate running water  i didnt think about that  marisha its a lot of 
none	 running water though i think theyre all right with rain  travis yeah they said a river is what the right  sam im sure they dont like it in any case the only thing that our rebels are rebelling against right  now are six zombie giants one of whom im pretty sure they killed already did i see them  matt best you could see that group was doing pretty well and was hacking it down lost a few of  their number in the process  marisha did we ever get a count of how many zombie 
town	 giants there were  sam there were six  matt there were six that you saw while you were doing your overall flight  laura what so we go out and fight zombie giants  sam no but maybe we could  marisha why not we are the most capable people in this town right now  laura well we could go fight zombie giants and then tell everybody to wait  travis nah its going to fuck us weve got to rest  marisha why dont we take a short rest heal up a bit get back out there 
none	 take down some giants  what do you guys say  sam i admire this fire in your eyes but its so stupid  laura what if we run out and tell people to stop fucking fighting and wait until tomorrow  liam they wont the giants are going to keep smashing them  sam what time did he say it was  taliesin its about three we could just do a round of the front courtyard and see whats going on  laura fuck fine  taliesin try and sleep through the night  laura all right we fight 
none	 until we absolutely cant fight anymore  travis what about the people who absolutely need a short rest at the minimum stay  liam we stay for an hour  taliesin were shortresting right now  liam rest for an hour  marisha this is going to go on for a while but the longer we wait indoors the more people are  going to die and if were killing people to try and save the masses which is how im justifying  this whole thing by the way i feel like we cant leave the masses to their own 
none	 devices  sam wait a second what about that what about that cleric the religious man that youve talked  to could he get a message out to everybody whats his name  laura at this point though its chaos  travis yeah  marisha we literally lit the fire and we cant stop it now  sam archibald is that his name  travis yeah theyre standing up for themselves  taliesin we also somebody theres the point that somebody is informing on us  marisha someone is informing on us  sam what are you talking about why 
none	  taliesin they were ready for us they knew we were coming  sam of course they knew we were coming we killed one of their  laura they said there was an informant they said that there was an informant when we were there  travis who did  laura that guard he said our contacts were right our informant was correct somebody is  informing on us it could be you  liam i insightcheck this woman  matt go ahead and roll insight  liam 14  laura can i say it because i just said it 
none	 could be you can i do the same thing  matt sure go ahead  laura all right thats terrible okay so  sam what do you want to know  matt best that you can tell she just looks genuinely scared and is uncomfortable with your  presence right now but is letting it happen shes still getting over the fact that you guys look  entirely different than when you first talked to her about staying here  laura well short rest and then we head out we do some attacks and  liam ive never fought a 
town	 zombie giant before  laura no but everybody else is doing it those peasants are doing it  liam thats what im saying lets see what were up against lets take a breather and lets go  pick one off  marisha jordana do you have any books here on zombie giants  matt for the most part necromancy is not studied in this town at least we never had to  deal with it until recently and we havent had the opportunity to really study since  marisha well i mean zombie combined with giants weve fought zombies and 
none	 weve fought  giants so im assuming it with a vague  travis what  laura we keep our distance  taliesin how long does it take to recharge hex by the way  matt you need a long rest  travis how many sunbeam hadoukens do you have left keyleth  marisha how many hadoukens as in sunbeams im done on sunbeams  sam we need to rest  travis if we get a short rest how many do you get  marisha im done none  laura we need a long rest to get spells  marisha however 
none	 if i short rest i actually havent burnt any of my animal forms here recently  and i can water elemental up which would also permanently kill them so i have other defenses  that could still take down vampires if we encounter another one im more concerned about  these giants right now  travis thats what im talking about theyre vampires  marisha no theyre zombies theyre undead  laura theyre zombies  liam theyre undead  travis those are two different things huh  matt they are two very different things  travis grog learns  laughter 
town	  matt all right so whats the plan  laura we short rest and get back out  liam we take a short rest and then exterminate  sam wait join the rebellion or ride around town telling everyone quell  marisha were taking down these damn giants these giants are killing people left and right we  watched them crush people on our way here  taliesin we tell them that they take cover during the night  travis im going to roll four hit dice  matt yeah you guys go ahead use your hit dice to heal 
none	 up while youre taking your short rest  for those whove taken damage  laura oh trinket can you heal trinket  marisha i can  laura heal him so much does trinket get oh he does get hit dice  matt trinket technically does not trinket requires  laura it says he does its written down  matt hit dice  laura yeah  matt okay  taliesin also another strange question what creates initiative initiative is your dexterity  modifier  matt correct  taliesin so with me its my dexterity modifier plus two  matt correct  
none	 taliesin im also currently wearing a headband of initiative which id forgotten about  matt which  taliesin gives me plus two to my initiative  matt correct  taliesin oh dear god almighty okay thank you  matt percy percy percy  taliesin i dont mean to be doing this  matt no its great just glad you didnt take the alertness feat then things would have gotten  stupid  laura are you healing trinket  marisha how much more does he need  laura hes at 36 he needs 24 more  taliesin actually im going to 
none	 be using the hat of disguise just because its probably safe does  anybody want a headband of initiative  laura yeah do you not need it  taliesin i cant wear two things on my head  laura i dont have anything on my head  taliesin so youve got plus two to your initiative and im losing plus two to my  initiative its called a headband of initiative  marisha you already have an eight to your initiative  liam its very mystical  travis how much time do we have before the sun that is being 
none	 blocked by the rainclouds goes  down  matt well you guys are taking a short rest about 30 minutes to an hour so you have about two  and a half three hours before it goes down entirely  taliesin that should give us enough time to do a quick tour we already know their walking route  and im sure that the people are putting up a fight  marisha im going to give him a level two cure wounds  laura okay  marisha so do 2d8 plus ten  laura me  marisha sure me or 
none	 you whoever feels more comfortable  laura ill do it it was good  matt during this rest if you wanted to spend some time with that cape  liam i do im going to sniff it and shake it out  matt for the most part it doesnt appear to be enchanted  sam no i can sing a song of rest for all of us  marisha and laura oh yeah do that  sam it gives us all 1d6 thats pretty weak  marisha no but thats  laura no its fine hes got extra hit points 
none	 dont worry about it  marisha well song of rest just happens right do you get that for free you might as well if  you dont burn anything  sam okay sings health we need some now health not just anybody health you know you  need someone  all sings health  matt thats not trademarked at all i love it all right so you guys have rested up through the  rest you occasionally hear voices run by yelling as you guys get toward the end of your  rest you hear the stomping large heavy footfalls 
none	 heading nearby groaning crash a  loud heavy impact and you hear some short cheers outside  travis yes  laura yay  sam oh he died thats two down splash two  travis right out front we hear it  matt out front a little ways off not immediately  sam do we have horses we dont have any horses do we  laura no  liam they died  matt yeah they got eaten by harpies  travis should we go outside and see how theyre doing  taliesin yeah lets check it out  travis we go 
none	 out front  liam time to kill some giant undead  matt okay jordana lets you guys out locks behind her  marisha do we want to split up  taliesin no lets keep together  laura actually before we go i ask do you have any holy symbols at all in here  matt im sorry no  laura nothing  matt no all those were kept in either of the two temples here  laura do you have anything magic that could help me  matt i already gave you everything of magic that i had here  
none	 laura oh right i forgot we took it  matt sorry  laura shit all right thank you  travis once were outside how far away is that giant that was felled  matt as you step outside and look its about 60 feet off near one of the big crossroads near this  area and a zombie giant has been completely felled down and there are three people now that  are currently in the process of hacking its head off just to make sure its a group of about seven  people that live here theyre all looking 
none	 pretty messed up but theyre all eager and  adrenalinedriven theyre all hacking away then stopping and taking a breath breathes heavily  you hear in the distance thunder crack bolt of lightning coming down from the storm and as it  echoes everyone shakes for a second look at each other cheers give a cheer of victory they all  hop off the body of the zombie giant and begin darting further in towards the center of the city  marisha i look up is my de rolo symbol still in the sky  matt its there its dissipating 
none	 slowly but its still there its moved a little bit offaxis  with the storm  travis so thats it for the big houses right just the castle  taliesin just the castle  sam except we havent killed the members of one of the houses by the way my song of rest is a d8  laura awesome  sam but we havent killed the last one now the one that you guys killed whats his name again  tylieri  matt tylieri  sam he was a vampire  all yes  sam because sylas killed him right 
none	  taliesin yes  sam and then made him a vampire  taliesin one would assume  sam didnt he hang him on the sun tree  laura what no what what are you talking about  sam i dont know didnt that guy that we meet  matt you do recall actually when you were interrogating the driver of the briarwoods  tylieri was the master of the driver desmond who beat him and subjugated him to various forms of  torture and abuse before lord briarwood took desmond and to try and show extension of faith  revealed 
town	 to desmond tylieri hanging from the sun tree that was true  travis wow  sam and then he became a vampire is that where theyre spawning  laura no maybe he was already a vampire and he hung him from the tree just to show  sam that doesnt seem right  taliesin lets head to the sun tree why dont we  laura lets head that direction  travis lets go  marisha something to us about how when people die in this town the guy you talked to at the bar  sam yes we talked to 
tavern	 a guy at the bar what about him  marisha he said when people die here they dont die  sam well yes we know that yes  laura they come back  liam they could be yes that could apply too  marisha i think this whole damn town i think the whole land is cursed is what i think  travis i think thats  laura probably pretty fair  travis should we go to the tree  laura sure  marisha why  taliesin just to see  laura well make our way through the town and 
town	 look for giants as we make our way to the tree  marisha lets look for giants lets go gianthunting  matt okay all right so from the alcove you guys head in a southwestern motion keeping off the  main paths best you can the main chaos seems to have died down a little bit in this area of the  town you come across another body of a zombie giant surrounded by what looks like eight bodies  of civilians of the town  laura are they all dead or are they injured  matt no they are 
town	 all very dead two of which are torn in half and just tossed to different sides  one appears to be halfeaten and the rest are just smashed but whatever troop was with  them managed to take the zombie giant down eventually you make your way to the center of the  town square where the sun tree is and there is across the way on the opposite side what appears  to be in midstruggle one zombie giant that has a series of spears or javelins sticking out of its  torso its currently swatting at a group 
none	 of individuals that have torches in the rain still  trying to get up towards it and push it backward the sun tree at a glance roll a perception  check  marisha all of us  matt yes  taliesin one theres a tree  sam four  marisha i rolled a 19 so 29  matt okay  liam 23  laura if my passive perceptions higher than my roll  matt active perception and passive perception passive is more something to keep track when  youre not actively perceiving so grog  travis seven  matt okay 
none	 keyleth you pick this out in the rain and its hard to see but from this angle  you see what looks to be eight ropes currently just dangling free from the sun tree  taliesin damn it  laura shit  sam the tree is the spawning spot  laura really  sam or maybe one of them  travis or maybe they cut them down  sam weve got to cut down this tree  laura does it look like the ropes have been cut  matt you can go closer to inspect it if you want  
none	 marisha yeah  matt youre hearing in the distance the roars the battles still raging about 65 70 feet from  you you get up behind the tree and you take the ropes and inspect it all the ropes are very  finely cut  laura oh they were cut they cut them down  travis they cut their dead down  marisha okay so the nooses are gone  matt yeah and you do see there are a number this close you can see there are loops of rope  all over the tree some very old and weathered 
none	 and aged some of them are torn some of them are cut  but the fresh ones that are the longest currently and that are placed closest to where the bodies  were originally there are all very cleanly cut  laura can we spin around and look and see if theres anything around that looks like or look  at tracking and see if it looks like somebody cut them down or if they fell on their own  matt you glance around real fast and you can see to the south there is still the battle raging  
none	 between the zombie giant and the crew of individuals but you look back where you guys were  from and you see a large series of shapes stepping through the rain coming from the  direction you guys were  liam i think they cut them down just like tylieri i think that this is where they hang them  to ripen and then when theyre ready they pluck them off the tree and set them on their way  matt as youre having this conversation you keeping your eyes forward as hes saying this in  your ear you 
town	 can see as the light of the town is slowly beginning to vanish into a sunset  marisha is it still raining  matt it is still raining you see ahead of you coming from the central roadway into the square of  the town what you can only surmise to be anywhere from 30 to 50 armored skeletal entities that are  pouring from the north  marisha okay i climb the sun tree  sam wait what weve got to get out of here  marisha im climbing the sun tree  matt climbing the sun tree all 
none	 right you guys see keyleth scurry up the sun tree  sam i blow my horn of fog to create a smokescreen i dont know what the fuck shes  doing  matt okay foghorn sound the slow hornblow comes out and this fog begins to fill the area  between this marching skeletal army and the sun tree where you guys currently are looking over  your shoulder you can see the zombie giant finishes smashing the last individual in that  crew picks it up and jams it into its jagged giant teeth  marisha so theres a 
town	 big army coming down filtering down a street  matt down the street towards you  marisha how far away  matt you cant tell now theres just fog along the way  marisha i cant tell how far away they are right now  matt no you cant see them  marisha i cant see them  matt no because scanlan just created a whole bunch of fog between the two of you the moment  you saw they may be about a hundred or so feet from you  liam keyleth tell us what youre thinking because the 
none	 rest of us are taking this time to go  travis you engage theyll follow we go we fight another day we sleep in the rafters and  wait until daybreak  liam who are you  marisha i might be able to do something  laura what is it say it  marisha i can do a big ice storm or do something to take all these fuckers out at once  travis all 30 to 50 of them kill them all  marisha its a big range  liam no keyleth weve got to go  taliesin i 
none	 say we let her hit them and we run  marisha scanlan can you drop the fog just a bit  sam nope not by magic  matt he cant control it  laura its on the ground you can probably see above it fog is low  matt well the fog this creates is a magical fog that obscures an entire area if you climbed to  the very top of the tree you might be able to get a little bit of a visual  marisha all right im going to climb as high as i can  
none	 matt okay make an athletics check  laura im going to climb up after her  sam oh my god  marisha 11 acrobatics or athletics  matt athletics  marisha oh thats better 15  matt 15 okay you make your way up to the very precarious top of the branches you can feel the  brittleness of it as the tree itself its life force is withered over time and some of it cracks  and some of the actual bark of the tree twists off in your grip as you get to the very top you can 
none	 look  just over the bank of fog that scanlan has created and you can see beyond that the number of undead  from this angle what was initially like 30 probably pushes closer to about a hundred  marisha okay and theyre like a hundred feet away  matt starting about a hundred feet away slowly marching towards you  marisha right where they are im going to start a little ahead of where they originate im going  to start making an ice storm im pushing all the way back to where just right down these  fuckers 
none	  liam im also just trying to stay underneath her as best i can  laura stop looking up her skirt brother  liam is she in a skirt  sam shes been wearing a dress this whole time  liam i thought she was covered in leaves  taliesin stop looking up her fig leaf  matt all right whats the damage on that is it 2d8 bludgeoning and 2d8  marisha they take 2d8 bludgeoning damage and 4d6 cold damage  matt okay go ahead and roll for both and its a save for half right  taliesin 
dung	 inspiration  sam oh well i didnt do it  marisha 2d8 bludgeoning thats seven bludgeoning 4d6 not great at all four five  six seven eight  matt total of eight eight plus what was the other one  marisha seven  matt seven okay  marisha and its difficult terrain  matt okay so the first area suddenly you see some of the clouds above you begin to funnel  downward and a few bolts of electricity crackle through it as the funnel hits it grows dark and  then all of a sudden this cold wind begins 
none	 to swirl around it and with that the cloud almost  seems to tear open within itself and a sheet of jagged ice and sleet begins to pour downward into  the center of this undead horde as it does you can see probably a good 25 30 of these are just  blown apart bone shards scattered around and you can see bits of rusted metal weapons and armor  thrown left and right the ice then coalesces over the floor of this area and some of the skeletons  just slip but they keep marching forward it definitely 
none	 took a chunk but as it continues  pushing forward  marisha now we can run  laura good job i grab the back of her  shirt and yank her towards me  matt you guys make your way down the tree as you get to the bottom of the tree the zombie  giant has taken notice of the sudden flashing of light and the movement in the tree and is bounding  towards the tree after you guys  laura are we running  travis are we going to the alcove or going to the treeline  
none	 taliesin i say we go to the treeline and i say that you take a couple shots as were heading  laura im definitely doing that yes im going to shoot at the giant as were running hunters  mark him  matt okay you hunters mark turning around looking at the giant  marisha as she says that im going to go ahead and start casting my call lightning spell  matt okay so you land and you cast call lightning the fog that you created scanlan  sam yes  matt has formed up you start seeing shapes 
none	 these terrifying skeletal faces begin to appear  through the fog as the rest of the army begins to push through the clouds coalescing above keyleth  as you get your call lightning ready you marking the zombie giant you guys begin bolting out of  the way trinket comes running up behind you vex and picks you up onto his back and you guys begin  rushing off toward the treeline to the west or the east  laura can i shoot him  marisha yeah as i turn around i call lightning on the giant  matt okay 
none	 go ahead and roll damage on that  marisha and its cloudy so i get how much more  matt i dont know how much do you get more on that call lightning would be  sam while you decide which way are we going percy west or east  matt 3d10 it does an additional d10 it does 4d10  laura and im going to shoot him through my longbow of the sky sentinel as were going away too  matt okay  taliesin so the passage to the castle im aware of is to the west and then 
none	 the one that stonefell  mentioned is to the east  travis do we go to the treeline by the castle  matt no the one stonefell mentioned was the same  taliesin was the same  matt it wasnt stonefell it was vouk  taliesin yeah thank you  matt but yeah he was referring to the same one  taliesin treeline to the west so that we can attack first thing  laura 22 twice  matt 22 hits  laura and then three on the last one  matt okay yeah  laura well its technically 14 
none	 on the last one  matt for him still hits  laura oh sweet  matt its a big target big target lot of hit points  marisha and as shes brewing up her bow im behind her and just bring down the bolt for 32  damage  matt damn lightning sound you can see the bolt strikes the front of the zombie giant right as it  starts swinging after you guys the bolt hits its shoulder and blasts a chunk of its shoulder blade  off you see bone shards fire behind and theres a giant piece 
none	 of its torso now missing where the  bolt hit groans stumbles back onto its back foot and catches itself almost toppling over  marisha just start backing up vex  matt it starts lumbering forward again as vex releases her arrow which splits into three  marisha vex  laura 54 points of damage  marisha kill it  matt nice impact sounds all the arrows blasting into its body you can see they sink in  and burst on the inside theres a little a dull glow as this burst of electrical energy hits from  underneath its 
none	 sickly zombified flesh at which point theres a slight delay before it explosion  sound bubbles forth and a bit of its internal liquid just spews out like a boil you can see  its definitely taking damage and it keeps pushing forward yeah its still moving towards  you guys  liam how far away is it  taliesin for gods sakes  matt its about ten feet from you guys right now  taliesin i pull out bad news im shooting it with bad news and im going for an aimed shot to  the legs  matt 
none	 okay the moment it would take for you to stop and pull out bad news by the way the moment  you guys are turning around to attack it it has gotten within range to hit so this is all  happening simultaneously so its going to get two strikes as you guys get your attacks as well  marisha what are you doing  matt so go ahead and roll your attack  liam i did  matt what did you get  liam 27 and an 18  matt both hit  taliesin i got 28  matt 
none	 okay and against percy that is a 17 and a 20  taliesin 17 misses the 20 hits  matt okay you take 16 points of bludgeoning damage as its fist comes down and whack slams  into your side just as bad news fires off and your daggers go dagger sounds towards it  liam keen dagger flametongue combined 20 hit points  matt okay good to know  marisha and as soon as im able im backing up and bringing down another lightning bolt  laura well ive got another attack that was just one attack that i 
none	 did  marisha oh yeah  sam you need your spells we need to hide we need to run  marisha its okay this is a concentration spell i can keep doing it im not blowing spells on it  taliesin 22 points of damage plus hes knocked prone  matt okay easy enough through the daggers  taliesin oh he can make a con saving throw though  matt it doesnt matter it still manages to keep its zombie form though it seems like every single  hit youre taking chunks off its body but it continues to push 
none	 through the damage until  eventually it swings at you with the hit bad news goes off as it blasts through the center of its  torso and takes out the back of its spine it cant keep its physical form together and as its  body lunges forward you throw both of your daggers which go thoonk thoonk into each of its  eyes it falls forward the torso seems to roll on impact and come after you like a slowmoving  boulder for a few feet but since youre all moving forward you manage to outrun it just 
none	  barely keeping out of the way the legs walk on their own for two more steps before it  just falls forward into the mud relieving all its intestines into the rainsoaked ground  sam lets get out of here  marisha go go go run  laura pass without a trace  travis aggressive flower girl  marisha do i see any other as were running through  laura just run keyleth  liam i grab keyleth by the arm and i just pull and run  matt you guys go running back and as youre looking over 
none	 your shoulder you can see the  skeletal army swarming the center of the square and pouring into the streets it seems that the  briarwoods had their own reserve antiriot campaign at the ready  laura oh are they going to take out everybody  marisha we cant go we cant go  sam we have to go we have nothing left  matt and with that were going to conclude tonights session  groaning  matt well be returning next week on that note  travis laughs you son of a bitch i love it  matt all
