none	 matt hello and good evening everyone and welcome to critical role where a bunch of us  crazy zany nerdyass voice actors play dungeons and dragons for those of us meeting us for the  first time welcome this is us playing dnd from a homebrew campaign with a few homebrew rules but  overall its a fun time couple of announcements i want to get over before we start up the game  one we have a subscriber challenge apparently every 100 subscribers we get we are giving away a  signed poster of the cast of critical role 
none	 as well as a signed portrait or a giant poster of a  beautiful piece of art by kit buss our official artist the cast will be signing both of those and  giving those away to whoever wins and every 100 subscribers whoever is active in the chatroom will  be opting in to be chosen randomly for that prize so well keep an eye out for that and we will be  announcing those winners as they come in so thats every 100 subscribers also there is a challenge  that if we can manage to hit 7000 
none	 subscribers by the beginning of the day tomorrow the streaming  tomorrow one there will be apparently some sort of pikachu costume will be purchased and worn around  the studio this is all the information i have and im excited at the vagueness that was  presented to me because that could mean anything which you know with enough pressure peer  pressure especially anyone can be put into a pikachu costume  zac not anyone  matt laughs anyone also there is apparently a promise for a party tomorrow evening with some fun  guests and performers if 
none	 we manage to hit 7k by the beginning of tomorrows stream this has been  given to me by our gracious overlord also apparently the mods have their own challenge if we  hit 7k by tomorrow that ive been told i dont really need to mention which means im going to  mention it because apparently there will be a snugglelord or overlord body pillow made i think  you should try and make that happen  zac i asked really politely for that not to be mentioned cool no im going to remember that  matt how could 
none	 you not mention that how could you not mention that so 7k guys see if we can  see if we could make that happen because i think it means if one can be made many can be made and  i think all of us here at critical role would be happy to have copies for ourselves so thats now up in the  air lets see a couple other quick announcements we also have our charity 826la theyre a fantastic  charity 826 across the nation but especially were donating to 826la they have afterschool  programs and 
town	 a lot of tutoring for creative writing skills and general literacy skills i  cant talk today for kids from five up to late teens theyre a great charity check them  out we really appreciate you guys support in that also we will have a one week break in  critical role next week as both me and marisha will be out of town doing that thing in the  desert so well be gone for a week but we will return the week after so that will be the second  week of september to pick up our 
none	 regular critical role schedule from there i think thats it and  thats all lets see if anybody else have any major announcements  travis love you  matt oh grogs being sweet over there well have some fun things to show when we come back  but in the meantime lets go ahead and get ourselves ready to jump on in to our next session  of critical role  dramatic music  matt all right guys welcome back picking up where we left off to give you guys some overview  here the party had put themselves in 
none	 a situation where they taliesin is currently cleansing the  area of wil wheatons dice rolls from the previous two weeks  laura feel better  taliesin well see if i feel better  marisha no it does the energy feels better  taliesin no feeling better  liam if theres one place to use the flamethrower i think its on that  taliesin its right there salt the earth  laura no like youre not so much right there  liam i was being facetious i didnt see it im so comforted that its on your wrist right now 
none	  matt thats okay well look for it later i think we may be down one scanlan tonight  unfortunately sam couldnt make it so we will be missing our gnome bard for the evening i know  hes got family stuff planned tonight ohana means family in a language that doesnt exist in this world  thats okay the party had unknowingly broken the law of vasselheim and as such found themselves  in a conundrum where they had to choose either to go to the seat of judgment and be judged for  breaking the law or they 
town	 could join the slayers take which is a guild of monster hunters in the  town which they caused this infraction towards they agreed to instead join the guild however in  doing so they had to undergo a trial the trial involved the party being split into two different  groups and set on a journey to hunt a specific creature for each group along with a couple of  newcomers so we had our couple guest episodes for each group separate to do their own little  venturing everybody survived which was good  cheering  taliesin not 
none	 everybody  matt and laura oh  matt well get to that we will be coming back to the game in just a moment real fast travis you  should show us the really cool little thing that you  travis for my birthday i got this this is really great and heavy  orion if it was sharp it would be a functional weapon  laura it is a functional weapon without sharpening  matt so between that and orions wristmounted fireball launcher we are covering all the bases  marisha we have liams daggers lauras gotten a bow 
none	  laura i have i cant wait to shoot  travis matt got a cloak  matt i did get a cloak were slowly being converted by you guys into our respective roles  liam i think the one that im the most nervous about receiving in the mail is necrotic  laughter  liam somewhere theres a guy working in a morgue going oh  taliesin thats coming to my house its going to my house right there  matt all right so as the party that was sent to hunt down the rakshasa successfully completed  their venture 
none	 have been waiting very nervously for a few nervewracking days as they knew it was  a threeday journey day four crawls around and the other half of vox machina has yet to return  they have been staying within the confines of the slayers take guildhall and you can sense the  energy itself is tense in the air mertin and the huntmaster have done their best to keep you calm  brought you what you need and assure you that this was not a very difficult task they sent them  on but even as the days wane 
none	 on you can sense that their overwhelming confidence seems to be  slowly faltering as well its about midday on the fourth day when you hear a few loud thumps from  out in the foyer area you hear some low voices for a while some conversations some laughter  one particularly high screechy voice youre not familiar with that then slowly disappears moments  of quiet pass and there is a knock at your guys door on the far side of the guildhall  marisha do you guys want to get it  liam i got it  matt 
none	 you open the door waiting there you see mertin standing there and his red scruffy  scarredup halfling self with a sly grin as he looks over his shoulder its good to see you i  am pleasured to give you information that the rest of your allies have returned and you are requested  immediately in the foyer area of the guildhall  marisha i just run past him  matt you push him aside  orion really theyre alive  matt from what i can tell at least most of them i wasnt counting to be honest but 
none	 i the  rest of you push past rushing down the main other hallway that opens up into the main foyer area you  can see the hanging iron chandeliers are shifting slightly from the impact of the door slam as you  immediately peer around the side you can see before you vex grog percy and scanlan all  there with little trinket in the back looking a little chilled they look a little worse for wear  but definitively alive as they have just received their payment for their slayers take trial  contract  orion i run 
none	 up to vex and i give her a big hug  marisha i run up to percy  taliesin ow ow  travis i hold out my arms for vax  taliesin pained no its very nice to see you too ow  travis everybody else is getting a fucking hug  liam im walking very cautiously hey come here big guy  travis yeah and i just squeeze him in rub him amongst my breasts  liam you smell like ugh  matt scanlan stands there with his arms open if only she was here  marisha ive been 
none	 drinking a lot of water  matt thats all right we made enough money to make the rest of my evening interesting  liam come here you tousle  laura he almost died how did you do  liam i dont think we almost softly hi  travis oh for fucks sake  orion as theyre hugging i go to grog and i how big are you i have missed you too i had no  idea how much i would miss both of you  marisha im so glad you guys are alive  orion wheres percy oh there 
none	 he is  taliesin ow  matt during this extremely awkward massaging teatmilking process  orion i was hugging  matt a loud triple hand clap breaks the momentary gushy sharing of positive energy looking across  the way you can see sitting on the corner of the main central cleric desk is huntmaster vanessa  with her hands in the air very well i am glad to see that you have all survived it is i cannot  say not heartwarming to see you all enjoying the reunion so well although i had a very big  breakfast and 
none	 would prefer if this were to stop immediately you have all proven to be very worthy  of joining this esteemed guild i am pleased to have such talent amongst our ranks because of it  now if you could please follow me i shall reveal to you one of our great secrets one you must  keep and with that intensity you see the general white color of her eyes flashes yellow for a  second the time has come to brand you as new members please to be following me  laura please to be following you  
none	 travis did she say brand  matt she turns around mertin joins her side and the two begin walking towards the back side of the  foyer towards the hallway that was on the left side of the back area you guys continue to follow  them down a long hallway that is just door after door after door on both sides just closed seems  like almost a good ten or so doors on each side of this doorway as you progress you do manage to  come across one door that is open and it leads into a 
none	 darkened training area where you see two  slayers take members are currently in the process of training with two training dummies in this dirt  sandpit area as you guys walk past they stop and look over their shoulders and give you a nod as  you continue past you get to the very end of this darkened hallway where you see before you a  very intimidatingly large solid iron door no hinges just a large slab of iron with bolts into  it flanking it are two very well armed and armored members of the guild burly 
none	 humans with  heavily tattooed skin from what you can see each one of them their shoulder exposed you can see  the same marking into it the slayers take mark comes across as almost like a scarred brand in  that type of shape and design  laura and marisha thats cool  laura were going to have very skilled people branding us im sure  matt vanessa looks over her shoulder laughs i think youll be hardpressed to find someone more skilled  taliesin does that mean theyre not skilled  matt at this point the two gentlemen 
none	 standing either side of the door stand up and give a small  bow to the huntmaster  marisha do we get to choose where we get branded  matt at this point after hearing this loud metallic tensing sound as the two guys have now  grabbed these wheels that are bolted into the sides of the door and are winching them down and  you can see as they are pulling you can hear the sound of chains grinding and growing tense and  the iron door metal and stone scraping slowly raises up revealing a darkened hallway 
dung	 that  descends down stairs about 15 feet wide  laura perception  matt go for it  liam what could go wrong  laura lets use this one oh that was great  orion has everybody realized they want to burn things into us  liam weve done worse things to each other  laura oh even less its a nine total  matt nine total good to know that stairway looks pretty sturdy that darkness looks pretty  dark even with your darkvision  liam 20  taliesin can i use my passive perception  matt well keeping 
none	 that in mind as you look inside you can see there are torches bolted to  the wall that give a very low ember light and they are spaced out about every 20 feet or so  orion not enough light  laura oh there we go  matt okay as you cast light it brightens up the room for a second the two guards wince to the  side and vanessa spins around and says fool put that out this instant  orion but its brighter oh okay sorry  laughter  taliesin he had a point  travis 
dung	 hes not wrong  matt her intense demeanor softens for a moment and she goes there is a process to this i  appreciate your patience  laura we must be branded in the dark tiberius  matt she turns around and continues down the stairs do you guys follow below  taliesin im last  travis i put percy in front of me  orion i saunter in  matt okay whats the walking order in this  laura oh no  matt whats the order  travis yeah what is the order whos anxious you seem jazzed  
none	 liam im in front  laura all right fine im behind him  orion ill be right after vex  marisha ill be after tiberius  travis im the caboose  matt all right  travis i dont think the caboose makes sense now  liam grog doesnt know that  laughter  matt there we go and percy youre where  taliesin well grog says im right in front of him  matt all right so youre walking alongside scanlan youre staying near grog to hide behind  all right so as you guys descend down these stairs the 
none	 first thing that catches you is the  air itself has a very old smell to it almost like the interior of a dustcovered antique store or a  longforgotten and untouched tomb it has that smell of ancient sediment to it you continue down  the stairs until eventually it opens into a large darkened chamber the ground itself has a  soft almost sandy bottom turn that shit off whoevers phone that was  taliesin that wasnt me it mightve been me  matt all good laughs check your phones no worries  marisha it mightve been me 
none	  matt as you step into the chamber what little bit of light there is begins to brighten as you enter  the main area and you can see before you what looks like a beautiful stone sanctuary in the  center of this chamber built of white limestone with goldinlaid trim and designs strange  sandstone almost obelisks that frame a large zigguratlike platform that rises in the center of  this chamber just standing there in the stillness these little torches placed amongst the entire  thing brighten as you step forward and frame the visual of this 
none	 strange ancient structure  laura pardon me vanessa i thought you were just a band of hunters  matt shushing do you trust me  taliesin not really no  orion im going to agree with the room but you are nicer which is different  taliesin and were locked in  matt well either you follow or you leave and we leave you to the machinations of the seat of  judgment and you can deal with the law of vasselheim  laura lets do it  liam were here were with you  travis yeah were on board 
none	  marisha the law of vasselheim for not getting branded  matt all right then follow me and she steps toward the front of this ziggurattype structure  which has a staircase that is very wide at the bottom and slowly pinches as it reaches the top of  the structure about 25 feet up as you begin walking up the stairs i believe you have the  highest passive perception you notice there are small symbols carved in various ways throughout  the entirety of this structures design very faintly along the trim of the bottom of some of 
none	  the stonework also largely placed on the top of these obelisks on different sides it resembles an  eye placed within a sickle  liam what are you looking at  laura theres some weird stuff up high  liam like spider webs  laura no like eyeballs is it like eyeballs  matt its a single eye that is placed within a sicklelike curvature that has a handle to  it almost like that  laura is it moving  matt no its just a carving in the stonework that resembles an eye  laura oh okay  
none	 liam i dont see an eye  laura its that carving right there looks like an eye does anybody know anything about anything  that looks like eyes  matt this would be more of a religion check for anybody who has  taliesin religion check  matt religion  laura can i try  matt you can youre welcome to make a  laura natural 20  matt there you go start it off the sage worked  taliesin splutters  matt looking at it you immediately get the thought that this symbol represents ioun which is  the 
none	 goddess of knowledge prophecy and skill not one of the heavily worshipped you havent seen  really any bastion of worship of ioun in the city yet its always been those main five this  is the first temple to ioun youve seen since youve been here and its definitely been under  here for quite some time as you guys get to the very top of the structure you can see before you  the top of the zigguratlike platform is about 50 feet across on each side in the center there is a  small raised platform about 
none	 five feet high four feet high almost like a table or altar of some  kind that is circular in its shape and partially embedded in this is a large solid glass  globelike sphere that is probably a good three feet in diameter  laura does it look like anything weve seen before  matt not anything youve seen before per se its perfectly clear and it just sits there at  rest  liam is this where the burning happens  matt vanessa seems to have not paid attention to your phrase and just shouts up into the 
none	 darkness  and goes osysa osysa come we have fresh blood for you at which point a loud roar breaks  through the darkness shaking the interior of the chamber where dust and sand begins to settle from  the ceiling which had been waiting there for quite some time  liam was this in the fine print  marisha guys im thinking this might be a cult  travis and laura that was a really high squeak  marisha im a little nervous  matt at this point suddenly theres a shift in movement from the shadows behind the 
none	 ziggurat and  leaping up onto the platform before you guys you see movement and fur and rippling muscle what you  see before you looks to be a giant lionlike body thud steps onto the top of the ziggurat these  giant griffonlike wings whoosh flare out and as the light cascades up you can see now atop  this lion body is a femalelike human face wreathed with a mane of ashyblonde hair jewelry  wrapped around the neck and the shoulders you see as it looks down the eyes peering across all of  you no pupils 
none	 just a glowing straight skyblue color  liam are you the one thats going to be doing the branding  matt this little growl with a chuckle to it laughs a feminine smile comes to its lips as it  bends down and looks over the rest of you i have watched from afar hunters i sensed your arrival  and the spark of darkness you carried i saw your fate bend towards ours and cross at this  intersection i greet you and welcome you proven ones to our family and she bows and closes her  eyes ever 
none	 so slightly  travis we return the bow i return the bow  laura i look at grog like what  travis its a fucking lion with wings  orion ill do the draconic sort of  travis you saw harry potter the hippogriff will jack you up bow back  laura i nod  matt she acknowledges everyones existence and you see now huntmaster vanessa is also in a very  very deep bow and stands giving you all this look of dont do anything stupid i have been  keeper of this temple for hundreds of years  
none	 orion you dont look a day over 20  liam smooth  matt theres a brief moment where she gives you this keen look head to the side like a curious  creature interesting humor does not find its way to my chambers often enough these days  orion thats unfortunate  matt i appreciate your candor dragonborn  marisha she likes jokes  matt now weve built this into a tradition that you have all now come into and at this moment  you will come to bear the mark and be known as our allies her eyes suddenly 
none	 flare up with an  intense blue flame for a second all of you simultaneously at that moment feel this sharp  sudden burning sensation in your right shoulder you instinctively reach over and grab towards it  hissing  laura it just happened like that  matt you reach over and pull and theres no heat on the arm but there is that burning pain you go  and you look under pulling your armor to the side best you can and look and there over your right  shoulder you can see this same brand that you saw 
none	 adorning the shoulder of vanessa when she exposed  it earlier as well as the two guards at the gate  marisha can you hold it up again  matt it is now raised upon your skin seemingly already healed like a longhealed burn or brand  mark and the pain slowly subsides into a dull sensation but it is not a fresh burn there is  not any peeled skin it looks like it maybe happened a few months ago and yet there it is  laura not going to lie it looks pretty cool  orion the design 
none	 is nice  taliesin id have liked some warning  liam join a few more clubs and were going to be all sleeved up  matt now i have been here building this place and this guild for some time with the intent of  helping rid the landscape of dangerous prey and helping those who are also aligned with the good  of the realm to bring their more powerful enchantments and uses to light  laura can we insight check and see if shes telling the truth 24  matt 24 it wouldve been good if i remembered 
none	 to bring my dice out there we are its been a  rushed yeah she appears to be forthright and honest there is a force of personality to her  that speaks beyond any sort of mortal youve encountered and even the extraplanar entities  youve discussed with there seems to be a forthrightness in her speech you dont feel  theres any layer of deceit involved she glances down at the glass sphere thats embedded in the  altar and as she looks down what was once clear glass slowly begins to glow with the same  whiteblue light 
none	 as her eyes it is here through this heartglass that ioun herself extends my  vision to watch the world from here i can see where our quarry lies and lays rest when  contracts are brought to our attention i can see if they can or cannot be hunted i can see where  the worlds flow between i can watch over my mate wherever far he may be this gift came at a price  to me but the good i can do that we can do is far more important than my sacrifice  liam how far 
none	 does your vision fall  matt the limits fall to where will would be bent against what wishes to be seen in person i can  peer through many veils but the further i tread with my sight the more barriers of those who wish  not to be followed can keep me at bay ive only tried to pierce through the abyss once that was a  dire mistake however you have come to understand one of our great secrets keep this with you  carry the brands on your shoulders with pride for you are now considered chosen 
none	 of ioun and myself  welcome to the slayers take  orion i take this with great honor thank you  matt she gives a nod to all of you she now stands back up the orb goes back to a dull clear  glass turns around heavy footfalls the tail whoosh swishing over your heads for a moment  the wings expand and with a great leap the creature disappears into the darkness if you want  to make an arcana check  laura has the glass totally faded  matt the glass has faded yes  orion ill 
none	 take that 24  matt 24 youve heard of entities like this this is a sphinx entity specifically referred to as a  gynosphinx  travis what  marisha dinosphinx  matt gynosphinx  taliesin and marisha gynosphinx  orion highly erotic  matt you hear a snarl from the distant shadows no  orion im still trying to figure out his sexuality  travis you didnt check for the bits  orion i dont know  matt a gynosphinx is a feminine sphinx entity that specializes in being able to peer past lies  to peer past magical veils 
none	 you can see how this altar this sphere is an extension of that power  though even that has its limits  travis good thing we didnt try to lie  matt at which point vanessa turns around to the rest of you well then i think that went rather  well yes  travis yeah sure  laura a little warning next time vanessa maybe  matt i like the element of surprise  marisha so question the little blue flashy thing that happens with the eyes is that going to  happen with us now too  laura 
none	 can she see through our eyes now  matt she gives you a curious look i do not know  laura shes not going to be happy with what she sees through scanlans  laughter  matt scanlans behind you going  taliesin oh i think she is very happy  travis scanlan is the cinemax of this group  matt scanlan says well if shes been in here for 200 years unable to leave shes going to be  really happy with what i can offer  liam peer into the scatological  matt its a whole array of 
none	 experiences that i provide as he puts on his mustache vanessa then  turns around and begins to step down the ziggurat well then shall i lead you back to the guild  hall proper you are welcome to do as you wish you have been released and i believe we have some  funds to give to you as you are now officially part of the hydra contract you originally broke  laura yay i like the way you talk vanessa  liam i have some questions though what is this relationship you and us now are we obligated 
none	  matt as you guys are walking back out of the chamber towards the stairway she goes there is  no requirement for you you are but a member of the slayers take if you wish to come by we have  contracts available and you can look about those if you wish to take up if you feel you are  capable of doing it let us know you will then be bound to that contract to complete it but there  is no requirement there have only been a few occasions that we have called our members to 
none	 arms  outside of contract and that is usually when there has been some sort of an outside for lack  of a better term a force that wishes ill to our business in which case we protect our own but  thats only happened twice since the inception of this guild itself so i would not worry but we  have work for you should you need it we have a place to stay and beyond that you are welcome to  travel as you see fit  liam what are your allegiances to yourselves to the guild or 
none	 to vasselheim itself  matt we have many allegiances whatever makes for the best business to be honest to tell you  this we like to make money  laura i respect that  matt we like to make sure that the city is protected from entities creatures beings that  would threaten the otherwise defenseless members of this fine city  laura very noble  matt and we like to make money  travis about that money you said you owed us some  matt yes and as you guys start descending the stairs now mertin is a little 
none	 bit ahead and he  knocks on the outside of the iron door you hear it lift again the rest of you make your way and  duck under the iron door as its lifted up and you make your way back into the guild hall hallway as  she leads you back to the foyer area she says yes so really its money to be honest but  the money we make we make generally for noble causes they do not harm people and nothing  terrible has come of it yet yet and she laughs to herself as 
none	 she walks on and begins pulling from  underneath the main clerk desk again pulling up a few pouches and tossing them amongst you theres  three of them she says spread as you see fit based on the hydra contract she tosses them  amongst a random couple of you guys  orion mage hand  laura i thought i caught all three i really tried  matt you caught two and tiberius drifted one down  laura how much is in that one  orion i dont know  matt you take a moment to count them all 
none	 each pouch breaks down to roughly 630 gold each if  divided amongst the seven party members  laura all right well divide it evenly  liam youre a fast counter  matt 630 each can someone note 630 for scanlan by the way  travis all right  liam 630 each 630 for scanlan as he is not here to do it  why yes scanlan i will take your share thank you i noticed vanessa has some cookies on  her desk would somebody hand me one of vanessas cookies thank you  matt these cookies were sent 
none	 to me as a fine gift from a friend of the guild sir darin de paul  of vasselheims finest performance troupe  liam they set my nerves at rest  laura so we have a home here we have rooms here we dont have to pay for lodging  matt correct you just stay wherever you like mind you there are probably more comfortable  lodgings but you do not have to pay to stay here  laura were staying here  travis are we free to go  matt of course i have no business at the moment 
none	  travis you guys we killed a dragon  liam killed a what  marisha yeah they told us oh my god we have so much to tell you guys  orion we killed a rakshasa  travis a what  marisha thats what i said  travis wait whats it called  orion its a rakshasa  laura does it do dances im confused  orion it had backward hands so i do that because its weird  marisha saying his name is very you know  laura oh so you killed something that was humansized then because we

tavern	 when you deenchant the carpet  matt at which point theres a knock at the front of the guild hall  marisha god timing  liam is there a tavern anywhere nearby  matt mertin walks over all right not a problem opens the door peeking from around the  doorway you see meekly a familiar female form short white hair silver and blue armor small in  stature there stands a meek and smiling pike  cheering  ashley oh hi hello  travis how did you do that your ways are mysterious  marisha how have you been 
none	 oh my god i think weve only been away for a week but it feels like  a year  ashley oh you know here we are oh boy its so good to see you guys ive been working on the  temple and some people are great there and some arent its been great im just so glad to be  back i got a couple of days off so i figured i needed to come hang out with the group  marisha how did you find us here how did you know to find us here pike  
none	 matt heres the circumstance with you pike they reached a certain point in getting a lot of the  temple most of it uncovered its still not quite at the level you want it to be and itll take a  few months to get into its full restoration however there is definitely a curse placed on the  tower that was once built over the temple which is why most people avoided it for so long and  didnt realize there was something beneath it the more you guys worked the more and more you saw  the curse 
none	 was essentially undoing and corroding a lot of the work you guys were doing to restore it  the group had to pool their funds to hire a high priest of the raven queen to come in for the next  week and cleanse the landscape of the curse that has basically prevented you guys from progressing  in restoring the temple so you have about a week to yourself  ashley im here for about a week  laura what should we do  liam lets go to kraghammer  laura do we have enough time  orion we 
none	 have to get the money from kraghammer right pike by the way did you notice any blue  shit around  ashley yes  liam like holy shit  travis like holy shit did you walk around going like oh holy shit  ashley we were doing a lot of dusting you know you have your little brush and i came across some  blue shit and i was wondering what it was so i just kept it there i didnt clean it  laura you didnt pick up blue shit  ashley i just thought it was so fascinating 
none	 i had to leave it there  orion apparently blue shit is charmed in these lands  laura its a very good blessing wherever it lands  ashley well i picked it up and i put it aside in a jar just in case  laura im sure she had gloves on you had gloves on right  ashley i had gloves just in case  liam a blessing from sarenrae  ashley thats what i thought  laura well what should we do  marisha well once again i dont want to leave because im assuming well lose access 
none	 we dont  have access to the airship for forever  laura its true we should probably go see your family before we go to kraghammer  orion well wait a minute kraghammer is just getting our money and leaving right  laura and marisha yeah  orion your family is that closer  marisha its around the corner  travis should we visit the shop and get some potions  laura oh my gosh do we need potions  orion yes we need to item up  laura just go and buy some potions  orion yeah  matt 
none	 all right  laura wait does the slayers take have a nice stock of potions  liam or an employee discount  matt you inquire with mertin and mertin gives a moment of thought and goes to be honest im  pretty sure that we gave our current stock to a couple of teams throughout including the one  that went and fought the dragon  laura oh yes funny thing we used them because it was a dragon do you have any more  matt at the moment no we have a few that are on order should be 
none	 here in the next two three  days so theres that but  orion is there a bazaar with any shops we can go to  matt i mean there is the bazaar north of the guild youre welcome to check in that area but  most of our enchanted potions are exported its one of the many things that the city makes its  money on and to be perfectly honest most of what youve seen throughout the world probably in some  way shape or form came from us we take a lot of pride in that but 
tavern	 youre welcome to ask around  good to hear this  orion as were doing the item stuff i would like to stop at a blacksmiths shop  marisha did we want to go to a tavern too what time is it  matt by the time this team has arrived id say its close to 200 in the afternoon  marisha okay shop then tavern  laura is zahra still in the slayers take or has she left  matt no zahra has left already  laura you guys really needed to meet her tiberius you wouldve liked her 
none	 a lot  travis she had a tail  laura she was red  orion i love tails ooh and thats my favorite color what magic did she  laura very powerful magic  travis moonbeam staff  orion a warlock interesting  taliesin yes quite charming  travis she had horns and teeth  laura and eyes lets go buy some potions  orion lets do  ashley where did you guys get these cookies  liam ask merkin he can tell you  ashley merkin  laura this guy  ashley oh hi  matt the halfling whos 
none	 now standing there the one who let you in that you didnt pay much  attention to because you were more focused on seeing your friends  ashley im sorry im so rude im pike  matt pike its a pleasure to meet you the names mertin  ashley mertin  matt with a t  travis merkin  laura and ashley merktin  matt i can take these cookies back  laura no please  matt but these cookies have been provided by a friend of the guild if youre a friend of them  youre a friend of 
none	 the guild  laura yay  liam look at these badass tattoos yeah look at that  ashley what is it  travis its a brand that we got from a giant sphincter  orion no sphinx sphinx  travis sphinx  orion a sphincter is your butthole not who we fight but when you go  travis boomboom  laura what should we do you go find a blacksmith and we get some potions  liam welcome to the critical role comedy hour folks make sure you hit the twodrink minimum  before you leave  laura do you 
none	 think maybe that you could maybe start out on a journey with us and then head back  if you need to get back to the temple  ashley yeah i have some time i think we should just hang out like old times just for a little  bit  orion yes  liam keyleth will fly you back licketysplit just like that yeah  ashley should we take the carpet  liam oh  travis right about that  liam vex broke the carpet  laura gasps i did not  ashley she would never do such a 
none	 thing she wouldnt do it youre lying  liam i tried to save it  ashley is it now just a rug  marisha its now just a very pretty rug  laura oh pike do you want to keep it at the temple  travis i thought we were going to get it reenchanted  ashley youll get it reenchanted  marisha im pretty sure its a very expensive enchantment  ashley i wonder if i could reenchant it with the poo  laura just rub poo all over it  ashley i dont know what it is  
none	 orion actually pike now that you mention it perhaps you could ask some divine blessing from  sarenrae make it a holy carpet instead  laura ooh  travis you have been working in a temple  laura its true you have some sort of thing where you do it with a spell where you can ask her  to help us  marisha you have a ten percent chance of succeeding but its awesome when it happens  laura you should do it  matt up to you  ashley yes why not  marisha yes we take the 
none	 carpet out  laura come on sarenrae  ashley okay i dont have any dice  laura oh look look at all these  matt so if youre wishing to use your divine intervention you roll two d10s the percentile  dice usually you have one that has two digits and one that has one digit roll those together  and youre trying to roll under your level so youre trying to roll an 11 or lower  laura combined of the two  travis roll one at a time  matt yeah the first one is  liam six 
none	  matt so thatd be a 60 yeah so as you roll out the carpet you take a moment to hold on to your  holy symbol you sense that sarenraes there but divine magic versus the initial arcanebased  enchantment here its a little out of her realm and her focus is scattered at the moment  ashley im sorry im just a little too excited to do this right now  orion you were coming from work  ashley yeah coming from work tired the time change  marisha im sure youre doing a lot with sarenrae  
none	 ashley well try it again later maybe  travis should we go get some potions so we can heal up  matt you can attempt it once a day  laura oh good we can try it every day while youre with us for a week thats seven times  matt you dont quite know how the divine interventions going to work but you know that  she may come and help you in some way  ashley okay  liam so what are we doing were going to go shopping for potions and then were going to go  
none	 see kikis family yeah  laura kiki is that what you called her when she was your wife  travis what time is it did we say  matt about 200 in the afternoon now  travis no beard check  laura try it  travis i cant its not a new day  matt well it took you a few days of travel  travis its a new day  ashley is there a little scruff there  laura its like fishing wire  liam you cant see it but if you rub your hand on his chin you 
none	 can feel it a little bit  travis 96  matt theres no additional growth one actually goes ping and it shoots off  laughter  ashley i caught it  travis gasps  ashley no dont blow it away  liam make a wish  laura no keep it pike itll be with you always  liam wish on the carpet oh  travis thats going in her sarenrae you watch it motherfucker  matt all right as you guys step out into the thoroughfare of the quadroads it is beginning to  rain a little bit and you 
none	 can already hear people moving through the city you make your way towards  the central portion of the quadroads where the large bazaar is set up there are a number of  tents and small shacks set up some are temporary and move in and out but everyone seems to have  their various tarps up and things to help protect overhangs from any prospect of customers from  getting rained on too heavily however the floor of this city which is already pretty dusty and  dirty in its own right has now become sludgelike mud and theres 
none	 this constant squelching as  youre walking through the city its easy enough for you tiberius to go ahead and find a  blacksmith generally there arent too many in this area a lot of those tend to be pushed up  more towards the braving grounds so its easy to find the one or two plumes of black smoke  taliesin i could send him to the blacksmith i went to  orion along the way i would also like to be looking out for any animal shopkeeps  matt animal  taliesin a pet store  matt okay 
none	 all right make a perception check  orion sorry  liam are you shopping for a little buddy  orion i am that is nine  matt so as youre walking along nothings really catching your eye you do manage to go to the  blacksmith that percy sent you to what are you seeking in particular  orion a dragonite raven  taliesin at the blacksmiths  orion the blacksmiths oh i think i can only do short swords and looking at a crossbow  liam you know how to use a blade tiberius  orion i do oh 
none	 quarterstaff i think thats what im proficient in so im going to crossbow  quarterstaff some darts  matt okay blacksmithing is more for construction the blacksmith there says well i  mean i can certainly make some for you but theres already plenty of readymade ones over at the  general store across the way and he points to a smaller building  orion i would like a quarterstaff though with bladed ends it is why i came to you sir  matt all right and the scruffychinned human rubs his halfbeard and thinks it over i can  
none	 probably fashion something i cant tell you how wieldy itll be but we can certainly try give me  about four hours probably with a readymade quarterstaff  orion wonderful  matt all right for the custom put you back about say 80 gold for the custom job  orion wonderful  matt you wanted a crossbow you said you want a heavy crossbow or  orion oh what do you prefer im a sorcerer so ive got to keep it light  matt then youre probably going to go with a regular handcrossbow go talk to that general  
none	 store over there and he sends you across the way you head over to the general store you  purchase base price for a handcrossbow is 75 gold pieces so mark that off  liam im walking over just to watch  matt all right a short sword is easy enough to purchase that is ten gold pieces  orion cool  liam you got a taste for the knockingabout fighting that thing didnt you  orion i dont like being unarmed anymore and darts  matt you also have to manage to get your ammunition as well  orion 
none	 yeah i need bolts bolts  laura if you buy a lot you can put them in your bag of holding thats what i do speaking of  hows my supply in there is it pretty good still  travis your supply of what  laura my arrows in the bag of holding  travis oh yeah theyre all over the fucking place  orion how much for 40 bolts  matt 40 bolts id say i put those id say for 40 two gold bolts arent too expensive its  bulk bin  orion okay then a hundred  
none	 matt there are only currently 80 available  orion ill buy the whole lot  liam i bought them for you  laura while theyre shopping i just want to drill keyleth a little more about her smooch that  she got  liam thats more interesting than the bolts  laura so wait he kissed you or you kissed him  marisha no he kissed me  laura he kissed you  ashley you were kissed  laura a cleric kissed her  ashley gasps  laura do you know who his deity was maybe pike knows him  
none	 marisha oh his name was kashaw brother kashaw he was a cleric but he wasnt a cleric to  sarenrae he was actually a cleric to this demon goddess named vesh  ashley oh  matt youve never heard of vesh  ashley i dont know who that is  laughter  ashley i thought i did for two seconds and then i was like oh wait no i dont  marisha it was interesting  travis does vesh have a lot of followers  taliesin its an old god youve probably never heard of it  ashley thats what 
none	 i was thinking  marisha yes no apparently hes the only one hes also married to her  laura and he kissed you wait a guy thats married to a god kissed you  taliesin oh i see how this could work out poorly  ashley what if she gets mad  marisha ive thought about that a little bit and then tried not to think about that a lot  liam tell her to get in line  travis i dont like that face  matt what im just enjoying some water  laura i shouldnt have even said 
none	 anything  marisha it was awesome though then he just walked off into the sunset  laura was it good it was a good kiss  marisha whispers ive never been kissed before so i dont know it was really good made me  tingly inside  ashley oh thats a great feeling  marisha yeah very nice  matt so while this is happening  marisha hes not listening were girl powwowing right now  ashley and marisha girl time  taliesin were shopping for potions  liam what else do you need its all on me if you 
none	 hadnt stopped that shithead from leaving i  wouldnt have put a dagger in the back of his head and we wouldve been looking over our  shoulders for who knows how long so everythings on me whatever you want tell me not a carpet i  cant afford it  matt theres no real potion shops the construction of potions is not a ready thing  people dont manufacture them left and right its a timeconsuming process and a lot of them are  exported so finding them here is a little difficult and theyre usually part of other 
town	  stores that sell it as part of their stock you guys before you journeyed out last time cleaned  out the hag  marisha oh thats something else we have to tell you guys about  travis can i look around the street and see if there are any shady types lurking about  matt make an investigation check asking and looking around no one seems particularly  helpful  taliesin excuse me im looking for potions can i get some service  matt some individuals push you aside  marisha i pull percy aside no remember this town 
town	 they dont like magic and stuff and they get  weird about potions and all the what are they called the bastions all control the trade of  potions so people get weird its weird and illegal  matt grog you come up to a gentleman hes dressed in a fine velvet brightredandmaroon  tunic and hes carrying a small satchel at his side and hes standing outside of a small tent  and hes like anyone come forth i carry oddities of all kinds if you wish to see what i  have for sale ill be happy to 
none	 sell them turns and sees you oh you sir you look like youre  in an inquiring mood  travis whatd you call me  matt sir its a respectful term  travis what were you saying  matt i should probably go  travis no wait you said you have oddities  matt yes strange things from around the lands i have them sent in from all over the  continents  travis go on then like what  matt like and he reaches into his pouch and pulls out this small jar that contains a liquid  and 
none	 you can see something sort of floating in this liquid its a little bit cloudy this is the eye  of a basilisk i procured from the distant north of taldorei  taliesin weve already got one  travis i think we have two  matt well then what are you looking for  travis funny thing i like to work out a lot and i like to go lift boulders in the forest  sometimes so would you have anything that might give me a temporary increase to my already  magnificent strength  matt let me see and 
town	 he rummages through this small tent on the side you see its more of a  storage tentslashbedroomslashwhatever it takes to set up shop really quickly this guys  definitely a traveling solo merchant  travis like the dude in the beginning of aladdin  matt a little bit  travis come close oh too close a little too close  laughter  matt that with a little more of a fake uppercrust renaissanceman visualization he  reaches back you hear him rummaging through some glassware and he goes i actually have a few  potions at my disposal here 
none	 he dips under one of the nearby tents that has an overhang to get out  of the rain  laura can we hear this at all  matt you guys are having girl talk right now this is a little ways out of the way  liam welcome to agrabah  matt i happen to have one such potion in fact i have on good authority it will restore some of  your own damaged internal should you find yourself in a dangerous situation  travis i like the scars that my damage situations leave behind im not quite 
none	 as interested in that  what else have you got  matt all right  taliesin stutters  matt you guys are off shopping elsewhere you guys are probably together though  taliesin how much was that  matt this one would run you 500 gold pieces  taliesin is it a superior healing potion  matt no this one is a greater  taliesin im not spending 500 gold on a greater healing potion  travis come on pull a vex get that number down  matt very well for you sir i perhaps have this he pulls out 
none	 a vial that has a gray  sparkling almost like it has an iron filing sediment inside this thick syrupy liquid it  looks like it would taste awful  travis ironschlager  matt laughs yes yes it is  taliesin why do they not make that  travis because theyd put a lot of iron in it  taliesin some people need iron  travis thats true  matt this ive been told has been crafted from and distilled from the blood of many a tyrantlike  stone giant from the far off mountains of the hinterlands this when 
none	 swallowed should imbue  you with the strength of a thousand men  travis a thousand thats just above like four  matt sort of  travis how much  matt for this one this id say would run you a simple 6000 gold pieces  ashley whoa  travis not that im not a man of incredible wealth would you be interested in anything  besides coin  matt speaking of which do you offer  travis well i have this fancy bag myself i happen to have parts of an umber hulk pieces of  dragon if you 
none	 might be interested in that i also have jewels and fancy robes if you need a  change  matt my robes are quite fancy enough but thank you  travis right i have an orc head and i reach into the bag of holding and pull out the orc  head  matt put that away please no its spraying on the front of my vest make a perception roll  no im sorry not perception persuasion persuasion  travis oh thats actually plus one for persuasion 13  matt 13 all right he goes pieces of dragon you 
none	 say  travis yeah we do we have 14 dragon teeth  laura dont tell him all the numbers  travis youre not there four cups of blood its probably more like a gel right now several pounds  of scales and maybe a few claws id have to look theres so many  matt how about this for direct trade no coin exchange necessary all 14 of your dragons teeth  and perhaps two of those blood vials  taliesin whispering what would vex do  travis how about  taliesin whispering thank you  travis all of the 
none	 dragons teeth and three of the vials of blood  marisha what  taliesin ugh  travis done  taliesin ugh  matt he accepts all of the dragons teeth three of the four vials of blood you can mark those  off the bag of holding  laura laughter youre such a dick  taliesin were getting you a leash  travis vex will be so proud of me  laughter  travis goodbye  matt all gone but you currently now have in your possession one potion of stone giant strength  travis stone giant strength thank you 
none	  liam you drive a hard bargain  travis can i find that in here  matt no when imbibed you essentially your strength becomes equivalent to 23  liam one time one big time  laura one use or is it multiple  matt one hour  travis one hour so my strength becomes 23  laura can he get multiple drinks out of it  matt no its one use  ashley what happens if i were to just pinky in  travis give it a little number  ashley give it a little taste  matt your 
none	 gums will get a little tingly for a while probably be a little hyper  ashley would there be any result  matt i dont know do you want to try  ashley im going to wait and try it  travis does that change my modifier at all when it goes up that much  matt oh yeah your modifier would become plus six is what it would be a plus six modifier  travis cool  liam money well spent  matt as you take it and you shake it around you can see on the inside of 
none	 that sparkling metallic  theres a small object floating around and looking inside it looks like its a clipping of a  fingernail or a toenail of whatever giant the potion was brewed from like a tequila bottle  worm  travis thats the part everybody wants  taliesin so ive just been sitting here watching this shocked  matt yes  travis look what i got lets go join the others  matt thank you for your patronage enjoy the rest of your stay here in vasselheim i hope to do  business with you again in the near 
town	 future he turns around and closes the thing he takes his  satchel and he starts closing down his tent and putting things away  laura wait you fucking track him down  liam youve got no idea  matt closes everything down  laura do we see him are we walking up can we walk up as its happening  travis as she walks up i grab vex and i go you will be so proud i just haggled down this guy so  well  laura what guy  matt as you point back and look you can 
none	 see now a cart is being wheeled away  laura i hunters mark him  matt laughs okay  travis why why would you hunters mark him  matt what level  laura what level what  matt what level hunters mark basic level  travis we are in the middle of a city where people might not take unwarranted aggression  well  laura level3 hunters mark  matt he stops in his tracks and feels the rain thats falling in his palm now its soaking him a  little bit he has a bit of cloth over his 
none	 head he puts his hand out and feels the rain for a  strange temperature change and continues pushing the cart pushes it through the mud rolling up  the rest of the thoroughfare and disappears into the city but you have a pretty good idea of where  hes going  travis so anyway i was working with him and you always try and get more for our money haltingly  and i definitely got more for our more gave more money  laura what did you do see im glad i hunters marked him what did you trade 
tavern	 what did you get  travis oh i gave him tiny bits of dragon for this amazing flask of stone giant strength  laura what is wrong with all of you  taliesin i was upset about the carpet and i wasnt hes huge what was i going to say  travis yeah percy got a vial of greater healing  taliesin no i didnt it was expensive and oh god  laura i need a drink  travis to the tavern  taliesin and marisha to the tavern  matt you guys eventually catch up you acquire your staff 
none	 over the next few hours or so as people  are resting having drinks and such it acts as a regular quarterstaff except you can choose  whether you want it to do bludgeoning or slashing damage  orion okay cool  liam i fall in step next to vex and look at her for a second whats burning your arse  laura everybodys breaking things everybodys spending all our money  orion we have 30000 gold pieces waiting for us  laura we dont have it now  ashley 30000 gold pieces from where  orion from when we 
none	 were in kraghammer  ashley oh you didnt collect them yet  taliesin so its credit theres credit  travis yeah its just waiting for us i mean were basically the richest people ever  liam we still have a keep  laura we do we have a keep we have a beautiful keep with furniture and servants  matt as soon as you say servants the barmaid whos coming over and filling up your drink goes  we prefer barmaid but thank you  travis oh excuse me oh can we have a goblet of your strongest stank for 
none	 this one  matt she looks over at her  liam she started before we got here just keep it coming thank you  matt all right all right  travis how much are they  matt for your strongest per glass ill put that at about  laura dont tell him the price of anything  matt very well  liam i lift up the cup and keep putting it in and say a round of the strongest on me ive got  that as well  orion ill take a water  matt all right you get water 
none	 you all managed to get your drinks a very very thick syrupy  meadtype alcohol altogether for those drinks vax it comes down to 15 gold for alcohol which  is expensive for a round this is very fine  travis shouldve let me haggle that down i would have got it to 19 gold  marisha hey youre thinking about it the wrong way grog its the other way you want to go  down not up  laura i love you guys  marisha orion and ashley i love you too  marisha i missed you all so 
tavern	 much  orion pike if were to just be roundabout and mill about today is that what you wish pike  after our tavern what would you care to do  marisha staycation  ashley well wait wheres scanlan  marisha he went to the park  liam you know he needed a little it was really rough going from what i hear anyway and he  needed a little therapy  ashley oh he needed a massage  travis i thought he was going to the house where they  orion lady favors  ashley i get it  
none	 orion well we could do whatever you wish if you care to wish the keep lets go back to the keep  we could easily get there and take an airship back if we choose to  liam we were also talking about visiting keyleths family can you get away long enough  to  laura maybe start the trip with us  ashley i think i can and then if i have to leave at least i can maybe meet your family for  a little bit  travis yeah neverbeenkissed hows that sound  laura are they your 
none	 family technically  marisha theyre our sister tribe because we all separated  liam tell us again sorry explain it again  marisha essentially about 900 years ago or so roughly a thousand years ago we were a nomadic  people and then there was some sort of great sundering were actually still not 100 sure a  lot of information was lost and the elemental planes started bleeding with this plane and oh  vex is falling asleep  liam whoa hey stubby wake up  marisha anyway long story short we separated into four separate tribes to protect 
none	 the places  where the elemental planes bleed into this realm once every generation someone is nominated to go  out and make contact with the sister tribes in order to establish further communication check  in learn about each others cultures  orion interesting  marisha were from the same people but we each have our individual cultures because weve been  separated for so long at this point  laura so these ones are fire  marisha these ones are fire yes so theyre located in a volcanic region and you can start to  feel an energy 
none	 from where the planes start to shift and it gets a little unbalanced thats  where we each live and im from the ones where we protect the air portals  orion lady keyleth did you just say where the planes shift  marisha yes because where all the planes almost like a venn diagram if you want to think  about it  orion who is this who is van diagram  marisha stuttering well he was a great philosopher of one of our peoples but he  described it as being these overlapping circles whats that  ashley 
town	 he was one of the ashari  marisha he was  orion van diagram was one of the ashari  marisha very great man  orion quick question about the planes will we travel there is there any way to perhaps get to  the fey woods through these planes  marisha we dont necessarily overlap with the fey we protect where it overlaps you could get  to the fire elemental plane easier from this place and my town you can get to the plane of  air  laura belches  marisha thats a good one grog  
none	 travis nope not me  orion that was vex  ashley that was a good one  liam its nappies time nappy time  marisha are you feeling okay vex  liam just give her an hour shell be fine  ashley she just needs some time  liam side note im two inches taller and ive always called you stubby  laura oh  liam come here stubby  marisha but anyway the last person to go on the aramente was my mother and she never returned so  we havent really had contact with the fire ashari for 
none	 a while  travis so youre pretty anxious to go then yeah  marisha i have no idea what theyre going to be like  travis but you know about where they are right  marisha ive gotten rough directions well have to probably figure it out along the way  travis are we hoofing it are we flying  orion we could do whatever you wish grog do you have a particular ability called magic weapon  ashley well i have spiritual weapon so i guess yes  orion theyre different things  ashley well what do you want 
none	 what are you looking for  orion i wanted you to bless my quarterstaff make it magical i need my staff enchanted i would  like you to enchant my staff pike  ashley and travis whoa  ashley i know what that means  matt youve been around scanlan long enough  travis the holy symbol goes shattering sound  orion i mean in a strictly platonic arcane sense  matt what little knowledge you have of enchanting items from your experience and you had this a  little bit as well from your own enchanting the process of 
town	 enchanting a weapon into what would be  considered a magical weapon is a weekslong process its doable definitely but its one of  those things where you would have to have somebody sit down with it over a period of time and daily  instill it with that magical energy until it finds its permanence within the object  orion is there anybody in town i could leave that with and pay to do that  matt probably  orion a mage  matt mage maybe not so much there are other clerics  taliesin itd be expensive though 
none	 its somebodys time for a week  marisha it also seems like this is one of those towns where things are expensive things are  expensive here  travis not if you know how to handle them  orion right ill hold off on that  matt but yes it is totally doable  orion is it a thing that i can like start to do hourly for a long long time  matt if you wanted to yourself yeah  orion okay im going to start that process right now  liam heres what i think lady keyleth has 
none	 been talking about this for a long time its calling  to her and were a family now and its her moment were here theyre right nearby theres  no use putting it off lets go to her family  marisha i am so nervous you guys im so scared  laura lets go should we go in the morning or should we go now lets go now  marisha well go in the morning  orion no lets sleep it off  ashley well take just a small nap  laura all right small nap and then first thing

none	 everyones drink  laura i tip him five gold and i give him a wink  matt he happily takes it and the wink is a strong wink he smiles back but also gives you  the look of like time for bed you all eventually finish your drinks and find your way back to your  respective rooms for the evening and have a good nights rest and on that note were going to go  ahead and take a fiveminute restroom break on our end well be back here about five minutes or so  so dont go 
none	 too far and well kick back in the following morning for what appears to be a journey  towards the pyrah tribe of the ashari  marisha im so scared im so nervous  taliesin youre going to do great  break  matt hey guys welcome back weve had our break so as the party comes to consciousness the  following morning a very heavy hangover coming from vex for the evening of lamenting the loss of  a number of financial things  marisha i whip her up a little herbal tonic here drink this  liam im 
none	 taking trinket for a walk for dookies  matt all right go ahead and make your beard roll  travis come on you son of a bitch yes two two 22  matt 22 as you come to consciousness grog wakes up and shakes his head for a minute and you look  and there is a good solid twoinch beard where was once the somewhat clear stringy  fishinglinetype scruff youre starting to see a little color come into it this thick black root  is now starting to appear at the base of the beard  travis singing 
none	 i feel so happy so happy  matt it is like horsehair bristles its very thick and you could probably clean dishes against  it  travis is it like an abe lincoln beard or do i also have a mustache  matt actually for you its only coming in as a chinstrap beard at the moment  liam oh wow  travis dont judge  orion i see vexs condition and i run out to get her a coffee from the bazaar and then do my  perception check on the thing  matt as youre glancing about and 
none	 getting coffee for her you manage to see a cart thats just  setting up this early in the morning in the bazaar you hear some squeaking and growling  and a couple of bird chirps you look over to the side and there is one small setup that has a  number of creatures and small animals and stuff set up in cages  orion oh as im running by because the coffees hot hot oh excuse me would you happen to have  any particular dragonites for sale male preferably but i will take female if you have 
none	  one quietly im just making it hotter when i blow on it  taliesin thats funny it took a second  travis what are dragonites  laura little baby dragons  liam like a pseudodragon  laura you going to have a little pet too  matt okay she glances at the coffee in your hand well i mean weve got two that are a bit  sickly but theyre for purchase if you like  orion i would love one give me whichevers the least sickly of the two  matt theyre both green its hard to tell 
none	  orion oh ill take the darker green one  matt okay that ones probably more sick but ill take it  laughter  matt takes the cage down and you can see there is this lethargiclooking tiny dragonite thats  curled up on this small perch and as she lifts it off it goes lizard noises and scoffs at the  cage thatll be 200 gold pieces  orion oh very good  marisha no dont pay full price for a sick dragon  matt there you are sir have a good day  orion thank you very much 
none	 any particular tips foodwise  matt dont let it die feed it give it water good day sir  orion okay so i run back and i go oh here you are  laura oh thank you  ashley oh whos that  marisha what is that  orion i think im going to name him lockheed  laura trinket looks very interested in lockheed  marisha he looks a little oh  matt trinkets nose goes up to the cage sniffs  ashley is he sick  taliesin i dont think its supposed to make that noise  orion 
none	 do you want to do some healing  ashley yeah ill do just a small healing  matt medicine check okay go for it  liam your bear shat like a fountain wasnt solid i dont know what youre feeding him it  was a little runny sorry roughage he needs roughage  laura trinket get some vegetables in your diet  matt groans growls  laura he likes meat what can i say  ashley what was i rolling for  travis i missed pike  ashley checking about the health i rolled a seven  matt he doesnt

none	 you take a point of damage  travis son of a bitch  ashley maybe you should name him lockheed peach  marisha aw lockheed peach  orion i think lockheed is good enough  marisha can i do a check on him and see if i make him feel better  matt make a medicine check  marisha medicine check oh thats not bad 19 total  matt you gather this may be some sort of a general illness that lingers for a couple of  weeks properly fed and taken care of would probably be able to get 
none	 it through its system  marisha i reach in my pouch and pull out a few goodberries  matt okay you feed him through the cage reluctant to eat the first piece eventually it  takes a bite and then begins to eat the rest through the cage as you continue through  breakfast  laura can you speak with animals keyleth  marisha i can but hes not an animal hes a dragonguy  ashley is he starting to look any better could i try healing him a little bit  matt you can try healing its more of 
none	 a diseasebased illness  marisha just feed him lots of water  travis i have some dry food rations if you want to give him a nibble  marisha i gave him some goodberries ill make up some more goodberries  orion we have a bunch of food and stuff well be fine we can move on with the journey  laura so its groggy but we decided to go see your family right right now  marisha i mean i dont want to inconvenience anyone  laura were going keyleth  ashley were doing it  travis theres fire 
none	  liam ive always wanted to see a volcano anyway  taliesin yes it sounds lovely  laura im sure theyre all as charming as you are  travis youll win them over  orion youll be fine  taliesin whats the worst that could happen oh never mind that was rhetorical dont actually  want to know what the worst that could happen would be  marisha i have to do a trial and meet their headmaster  travis royal stuff  marisha yeah  liam keyleth i saw you piledrive a beholder pretty sure youre going to be 
none	 all right  travis thats true  ashley yeah youre going to do it  marisha its not even that its sometimes learning about your past can be equally as  terrifying i dont know what im going to find  orion well lets go discover it  marisha well from what i heard we head south towards sunder peak towards the southwest its  volcanic territory  travis should we ask how far it is  marisha maybe i only got vague directions  liam can we see sunder peak from here  matt the landscape is very heavily 
none	 wooded and the canopy of the forest tends to rise and lower  about the height of the wall itself you cant really see anything beyond the wall of the city of  vasselheim anyway  laura so remember that way we found a hydra so we might come across some terrible things  travis one of you wordsmiths go talk to somebody and ask directions  laura i flag down the nearest person  matt make an investigation check  taliesin its happening theres nothing you can do to stop this anymore embrace the inevitable  laura 15  
tavern	 matt asking around and gathering a few folks and asking them questions eventually you flag down  one guy at the far end of the tavern hes an amateur cartographer whos in the middle of  sketching out the nearest area he talks to you for a bit and you mention sunder peak mountains  and he goes oh yeah yes no sunder peak its not too far from vasselheim its about two days  travel on horseback southwest the sunder peak mountains themselves be careful theyre pretty  steep i havent actually gone within the mountain range myself but 
town	 ive been within a few miles of  it just to make sure that i can mark it on my map but yeah it should be fine stay on the road  laura okay stay on the road  marisha do you actually have a map that we could use borrow  matt this is not done and i need to finish it before i can give it to a printer to make more  travis whats your girlfriends name  matt i should go and he folds up his map  laura no wait well be on the lookout

town	 wait what happens if you dont stay on the road  matt well forests tend to   ashley i mean i have an idea but  matt there are things that live there that are generally pretty dangerous theyve had people  whove travelled on these routes and at some point theyve been attacked or worse never came  back  ashley wow do you know what theyve been attacked by  matt i havent  ashley you dont know  laura and marisha hydra  ashley hydra  laura we fought a hydra pike  ashley not as 
none	 in the i understand  laura like five heads  matt glances back over at grogs ominous stare towards him again i should be leaving  laura parchment  matt yes hands you this rolledup piece relatively wellmade  laura we will use this to make notes  matt i appreciate that greatly  marisha you wouldnt happen to have a compass would you  matt no not that i can lend out  taliesin we could make a compass if we really needed one its not hard to make a compass  matt anyway im usually here in the 
none	 morning just going about my business so whenever you need  to find me  laura and marisha tyriok  matt he goes and heads off you guys are welcome to prepare as you wish  liam well we need horses right we dont want to walk  laura dont we have horses from our previous  matt your team has horses this team does not  laura but we have enough horses for all of us from our previous run  taliesin we had two extra horses  matt you did  laura yeah lets just take those horses 
none	 we dont even have to pay for them  marisha awesome  travis i need a new horse because mines back the horse  laura the back buckled  taliesin you can ride the bear  laura no he cant  matt it was pretty rough getting you there even as a warhorse you weigh a lot  travis so probably a new horse  marisha wait you drove the horse into the ground  laura okay so we need two extra horses  liam oh were getting more did you bust up the last one  travis hes all 
none	 like this  laura okay lets go find a couple of horses im going to ride trinket so we only need one extra  horse  marisha a warhorse for grog  laura yes i go get a horse for grog  matt okay the cost of the warhorse initially when you get there the stablehand who you talked  to originally youve gone already through it i can offer you another war horse were starting to  run a little low if you keep tearing through them at this rate  laura well well say were covered though yeah 
none	  matt oh thats 400 gold to purchase yourself a warhorse  laura oh 400 darling remember who we are we gave you excellent business before i have no idea  what im saying  travis come on this is your thing come on  laura i think as a return customer you can offer us more of a deal than that  matt make a persuasion check  laura come on natural 20  shouting  travis its verified thats a 20  matt he goes here how about this i will based on your previous patronage and if 
none	 you can  ensure that you would continue to send business my way i would be happy to give it to you at half  price  laura of course half price is a very fair deal grog pay the man  travis would you be interested in negotiating right 200 gold  matt chuckling mark off 200 gold  orion wait for two horses dont we need two  matt there was a warhorse for him and then theres two amongst you i dont know if you  wanted to become a horse and run  laura i was 
none	 going to ride trinket so that there were three for them  travis you could take the bustedup horse it just cant carry me anymore  liam trinket could take pike too with you  laura yeah me and pike will ride trinket  matt okay well then youre fine  orion is there another warhorse for sale for that price can we get the two for 400  matt if you ask about this hes like that wasnt part of the deal if you want another  warhorse thats a different transaction entirely  orion ill take one full 
none	 price i wont bargain  matt 400 gold  ashley wait but where do you put lockheed peach  matt all right well im afraid were fresh out of war horses going forward well have to make  sure our tamer goes out and probably be a few months before we get another load so take care of  what you have  orion how much extra for some side saddles  matt side saddles for that ill throw those in for free for full price purchase certainly side  saddlebags for your warhorse  laura tiberius i want it 
none	 to be known that if you keep asking me for party funds i will not be  so  orion these are my personal of course i would not want to upset you again milady vex i have  missed your company  laura youre so charming today tiberius  liam he called you a lady  laura he did  laughter  laura lets go see your family  marisha highpitched okay  travis and then if we get if we get just outside of the ill wait  matt okay you guys gather your horses fresh warhorse and 
town	 saddlebags upon yours as well  tiberius fine sturdy steeds this one looks to be a little more physically built than the previous  one you purchased hopefully it should last you a little longer hopefully you make your way  towards the southern gate of vasselheim the bastions open it for you and lead you out to the  front road that exits the south side of the city slowly it begins to divide into a southeast and  southwest direction you guys using the directions you acquired previously begin pushing  yourself in the southwestern direction of the 
dung	 path leading you deep into the vesper  timberlands you notice the canopy of the forest itself is so thick and high that it is not so much  an open pathway more than it is an open archway a tunnel that has been carved through the forest for  this path it is a very dense very dark even in the midday sun pathway and it progresses this  way for miles and miles you can hear birds and the wildlife living loudly and out in the open  amongst this forest there are certain portions of the trail 
town	 that you do see are being encroached  upon by the forest and trees themselves there are roots and vines that begin to stretch and try to  reclaim the road and you get the sensation that people that traverse here a lot have to  perpetually keep it clear there is something about this forest that in itself is its own  breathing entity beyond what a normal forest would be it seems to grow at a much faster pace and  even your previous experience in the deep portions of this forest it almost has its own omnipresent 
none	  malicious presence  continuing down for the rest of the day eventually the sun comes to set and what little  bit of moonlight that would find its way through the canopy is entirely cut off by the thickness of  the leaves and boughs of the trees you can continue to go through the night if you wish to  orion light igniting sound  matt a big beacon of light blasts out continuing pushing forward down this pathway its about  930pm and you have pretty good visual in front of you based on the light source 
none	 that is tiberius  how long do you want to push on forward  laura im a little concerned tiberius im afraid that some creatures might be attracted to  that light source it might actually be best to  orion oh snuffing sound  matt darkness once again takes the pathway  liam is there any moonlight  matt you gather glancing up there are fractions and little pieces that give you the sense that  some of the clouds have parted and moonlight would be visible if you werent underneath such a  thick canopy of brush if 
none	 not for your darkvision and the little bit of light in there youd have  no visual  laura light the end of your staff  orion im going to cast light under one of the flaps of my robe igniting sound  liam tibs i pull off and hand him my cloak of elvenkind which is one of the reasons im so hard  to see maybe we could just use that as a shroud for it just for tonight ill pass it to tibs  orion igniting sound ill cast it under that and you can be the 
none	 source of light  matt instead of a beaming beacon of bright light it has now become essentially a hood lantern that  you are now directionally focusing  orion now you look really cool  travis do we want to push on or do we want to rest we should push on  marisha i mean were all right right  travis were all right  marisha were on a path  liam 900 at night you said  matt its 900 at night yeah  liam i think its time to bed down i mean were not in 
none	 los angeles  marisha how far did we make it  matt id say from when you left its probably been about six hours of travel approximately to  where you are now  laura ooh it would be smart weve got another days travel tomorrow  travis okay make camp  taliesin lets bed down its not like we dont have to sleep eventually  travis ill take the first watch  marisha ill do my antilife shell for the first hour that way we all get an hour of good sleep  travis can i trace back a 
town	 hundred yards and dust of tracelessness it from where we came  laura the hunters mark that i cast on that merchant did he stay in town or is he out and  about can i sense that  matt at this distance  laura six measly little hours of travel i can track it  liam are you haggling with the fabric of time and space  laura no im just seeing if i can track the dude i put a hunters mark on is all  travis she went back to the 30s  laura and travis see 
none	  matt i would say at this distance if youve travelled youve lost contact with him however on  the way out you got the sensation that he was still in the city just not in the thoroughfare  that he was originally spotted in  travis mourning getting negotiated so hard  matt all right so  orion im going to roll real quick i was going to do animal handling thats the roll animal  handling every day so i can train it to do stuff so i didnt gain a point today and i take out the 
none	  decanter of endless water water anybody and then im feeding lockheed some  taliesin im going to try and cast some more ammunition since im out  marisha i pull out my little book of druid spells and history and i start freshening up on some  fire spells  laura i try to get trinket to eat some vegetables  liam i pass the fuck out  matt laughs you conk out trinket takes to a couple but seems to be reluctant as its not what  hes used to its a good start but trinket still likes 
none	 the comfort of fresh meat  laura trinket your uncle said your poo is runny you need to eat some veggies  matt bear noises trinket nuzzles his nose and pushes it out of your hand on to the ground  travis if i have the first watch i have darkvision and i take out my firebrand warhammer  as i begin my watch  matt okay it burns like a torch in your hand  travis no no fire  matt no fire okay you because the only supplies you have to craft some ammunition without  having an 
none	 actual smithy at your disposal it is possible its just difficult so go ahead and  take your tinkers tool check with disadvantage  taliesin god damn it 14  matt 14 you use the remainder of your supplies that are currently on you you manage to construct  12 rounds of ammunition for your pepperbox but you are currently out after that and you were  down to about three pieces left  taliesin i was getting a little iffy  matt i put you at a total of 15 bullets for your pepperbox  laura can you use 
town	 bulette armor to make more bullets  taliesin i can use metal theyre basically made of iron so honestly i dont know  travis we have two more pieces of brokenup armor and a lantern and manacles  liam and youre on watch right before i passed out i handed him my cloak all wadded up in a ball  around it and handed it to him  matt okay its hard for you to repurpose anything metal without an actual smelter  taliesin yeah i knew i would just get a little bit on the road right now  
none	 matt yeah and you can try for the bad news ammunition you should be about five shots left  taliesin five shots that sounds about enough  orion so to take a long rest i take can one hour or two hours to still have a long rest and do  stuff  matt a long rest is eight hours  orion so an hour before that im starting to enchant the staff  matt enchanting for a staff is a day focus you can do it slowly over time to help offset that  but itll take you a 
town	 lot longer to do it on the road its more of like when you get back and you  want to focus on enchanting it you can get it done cool you go over your spells you have that  crafted torch anything else before you go to bed  taliesin do i get an up to my hit points at level 11 do i get to roll more hit points at level 11  matt yes have you not done that yet  taliesin i havent done anything other than take my new abilities  matt okay well lets 
none	 go ahead and do that right now  taliesin roll a d10  matt d10 plus your constitution modifier percy is now level 11  taliesin yeah that happened  travis welcome  ashley yeah  all sing the super mario level complete music  taliesin thats ten im up ten points hit points  matt whatd you roll  taliesin i rolled an eight and my constitution modifier is two  matt right ten more hit points  marisha oh and actually you know what before we go to sleep or actually first thing in the  morning before 
none	 i learn my new spells  matt youre also three attacks per round now which is awesome  taliesin yes i am  marisha im also going to go ahead and be like hey guys i made breakfast and make a heroes  feast  laura another heroes feast  travis at night or in the morning  marisha at night because i had it learned  matt everyones going to eat a heroes feast before bed okay  laura wait how long does it last us  marisha 24 hours  matt yeah its 24 hours  laura okay 
none	 so until we go to bed tomorrow  marisha yeah because im learning new spells in the morning  taliesin what do we get  matt as you pull out the second gemencrusted bowl that you purchased in the bazaar earlier you  mark off another thousand gold pieces from your personal fund and as you guys watch keyleth all  of a sudden puts her hands out in front of her and from the very earth itself around your  campsite fwoosh springs forth this long table of cornucopias and fruits and fine meats the smell  permeates the 
none	 air like the best eating hall youve ever been to  orion oh bananas  marisha i thought of you  laura this is amazing keyleth  ashley oh man  travis i pick up keyleth i give her a big squeeze oh thank you  marisha choking noises grog  travis oh sorry i drop her  ashley im going to try the carpet again  matt okay so as youre eating and chopping you step away from the table and set the carpet down  and you grab your holy symbol and you close your eyes praying up 
none	 to sarenrae to hopefully in some  way shape or form be of an aid in restoring this onceenchanted ally  travis be a zero or a one  ashley two  laura isnt that good to roll a two  travis she has to hit 11 or under  matt you sense that once again the attention of sarenrae is scattered and at this moment in time  you feel like there is little attention towards this small arcane artifact that was lost not of  your own hand  ashley i know im sorry sarenrae  marisha so 
none	 at the top of the morning as part of the heroes feast everyone gets 2d12  matt 2d10 2d10 additional hit points to your maximum  marisha and you heal that as well  laura for a day  travis we roll that right now  marisha and you also fill up that as well  ashley yay thats amazing  liam thats tight right there  laura tight  liam yes thank you for introducing that to liams vocabulary  marisha also everyone now has advantage on their wisdom saving throws  travis just for the day right  
none	 marisha for 24 hours  matt youre immune to poison immune to diseases immune to being frightened and all wisdom saving  throws have advantage  ashley immune to being frightened all of us  matt after eating this meal it instills you with an extremely powerful naturebased enchantment  you feel your physical form given unnatural heartiness and the confidence instills your  entire body and so you are immune to poison immune to disease immune to frightened and you  get advantage on your wisdom saving throws for 24 hours  travis i aint afraid of no ghosts 
none	  ashley the opposite of tryptophan  matt a very fine a very expensive meal all right you guys eventually find yourself getting  to rest through the evenings rest grog keeping watch eventually the weight of the meal comes to  your form and you begin to fall asleep you all wake up in the morning untouched unscathed but  all asleep  travis snoring  liam gasps  travis fuck  ashley you fell asleep  travis no no it was just so calm that once the sun came up i heard you i fell asleep  laura 
none	 youve got a lot of drool in your beard  liam ill take the first watch next time everythings good no use crying over spilt milk  lets keep going  marisha its good to have a good nights sleep though  liam yoink thank you whoosh  travis sorry zero zero  matt hundred no progression on your beard  travis aw i thought it was like the lowest roll you could ever do  laura zero means ten thats a hundred thats the best you can do  liam the lowest you can get is ten  travis 
none	 shit  liam or 11 really  matt its all right but you still have your fancy little lincoln going on  travis they call me honest grog like lincoln no  taliesin no i was there i was with you  travis zero zero hundred  laura lets go  matt all right you ride up again you get yourself back on the path and you progress up the  pathway you continue to ride for the next six to seven or so hours stopping briefly to eat lunch  and just get your energy up  orion feed 
none	 lockheed  laura leftover from the big feast  matt theres been no change in lockheeds health visually yet but you continue the process you  push forward for the remainder of the day eventually getting to the end of your second day  of travel as the sun is beginning to slowly set you watch the direction its passing and you can  see now in the distance what appears to be a large mountain range beginning to appear above the  breaks in the canopy where you can see part of the trees begin to part there are 
none	 aspects of the sky  visible you can see the clouds have regathered theres a little bit of sunlight that breaks  through every now and then you can see just the general glow of the sky as it pushes over but you  do see the edge of a mountain range in the distance probably no more than a couple hours of  travel to get to the actual base of  marisha worried sounds  orion that wasnt a word  travis is that an ashari song  marisha im just its just a lot of pressure its 
dung	 good  orion so how should we approach  marisha well just approach like one would approach  matt you hear a sudden clap of thunder thunderclap comes rumbling through the sky and  you can see above the mountain range the clouds that are gathering are very dark and a roiling  thunderstorm is starting to break over the mountain range you see flashes of light from  within and a few other claps of thunder rolling over the mountain range  laura does it look natural  matt it looks like a thunderstorm its not ominously dark more 
none	 than what youre used to but  it looks like there is a thunderstorm blowing through  marisha can i do a nature check see how long its going to hang out ooh 17 thats 27  matt you take a moment and watch it it is stationary taking a very close look it doesnt  appear to be pouring any rain its just a thick gathering of black thunderclouds that has yet to  release its watery payload  laura what do you think keyleth does it look safe to traverse  marsha it just formed right we watched 
none	 it happen  matt as you approached and noticed you could see that the storm is there  orion apparently your people have a taste for the theatrics  laura do you think thats where they are  marisha i drop to my knees and i do commune with nature  matt as you spend a little time focusing on the landscape around you whats the range on that  marisha its big 5thlevel spell  matt here we go got it laugh all right so three miles of you its a little bit beyond three  miles but you 
none	 gather at least within the distance there that nothing immediately visible but the  temperature you can gather gets slightly warmer as you approach the mountain range thats the  most you can gather from this distance  marisha looks like thats the way  liam is it safe to just approach  marisha thats what i did with the earth ashari but i mean they were welcoming and kind  orion maybe they will be too you know maybe they just like being warm  ashley do they have a reputation of being  marisha we havent made contact 
none	 with them in almost two generations i dont know last time we  made contact with them it was fine and everyone was good but who knows its been a while  because my mother didnt come back  liam this is maybe awkward but you and we share something in common our past is awkward i get  the sense that yours is not as much your people are they a mix of many kinds  marisha how we came to be for all we know once again roughly a thousand years ago certain  people possessed natural abilities 
none	 we assumed we were blessed by the gods of nature and when we  realized we had these abilities and then the sundering happened thats when we banded  together but it could have been anyone between humans elves there were a few dwarfs gnomes  mainly humans and elves so were primarily i guess you could say mutts primarily halfelven  but we separated off into our own separate tribes so we each developed our own individual cultures  even though we came from the same root  liam but predominantly a melding of humans and elves  marisha 
none	 but were accepting of all races at least the air and the earth ashari are  orion and i assume they are steeped in tradition as well such as your own people  marisha yes absolutely and each tribe has its own tradition its had a lot of time to develop  orion oh i see im going to reach in my dust of illusion and  laughter  liam friendly fire  orion its okay it didnt break  matt that was the day that orion set himself on fire  taliesin right here on camera  liam we 
none	 just hit 7000 subs when orion set himself on fire  orion it happens all the time when you bend it  taliesin sputtering laughing  orion its fine were all okay  marisha it touched my ass it hit me in the ass  taliesin theres like five jokes im not making right now  orion and i just sprinkle some on myself and i turn my scales silver  matt okay magic noise all of your scales shift into a glistening silver color that of the same  scales that the followers of bahamut had adorned their armor 
none	 with when you went to that section of  vasselheim  orion this is the color my brother faeryn is  laura it looks good on you  liam yes so youre a silvercolored dragonborn now  orion if they are steeped in tradition the metallic dragonkin are more welcome in societies  more than the chromatic as weve seen  liam judging books by their cover yes i ride my horse around in a circle just to face everybody  and say everyone maybe go a bit back go behind keyleth vexahlia and i will trail just behind as 
none	  your retinue  marisha sure  ashley is there anything we can do to help or just make you feel a little bit more at ease  marisha i dont know what to expect  orion i have this longbottom herb you can smoke before we go  marisha im good ill wait  liam we need her clear tiberius  marisha see what im most nervous about is when i went to the earth tribe they said that my mother  had passed through and went through her training and her ulare trip and she was fine and 
none	 then  continued on  laura maybe your mothers still here  matt thunder another lightning clap  taliesin lets get a move on i think  marisha okay  travis keyleth were all here behind you youve got this  laura well pretend to be your small army you are our leader  marisha okay and please dont mention anything about us being called the shits when we first got  started  ashley vox machina thats all it is  travis wait is that kashaw made you look break the tension never mind youve got it  matt 
none	 you continue riding towards the mountain range at the base of the sunder peak mountains  eventually the forest begins to give way as the ground itself becomes less and less hospitable to  vegetation theres a certain smell to the air that seems to come through the wind that buffets  the bottom of the mountain range itself it smells like a distant forest fire like you can smell  almost like burnt cedar a little bit of ash to the air you make your way to the base everyone  roll a perception check  liam 15  
none	 taliesin 17  marisha nervous 14  ashley 17  laura 15  travis eight  orion 13  marisha 14  matt okay percy everyone else you look about this mountain range and its just the sheer edge  like theres no real sign outside from climbing it up how youd manage to find  laura oh is it favored terrain  matt is mountainous part of your favored terrain  laura oh is it still mountains  matt yes these are mountains you glance up though you notice that there is apparently two  paths that diverge at 
none	 the very base theyre very steep back and forth switchback winding paths  that lead up the front of the mountain its hard to see exactly where they lead because once they  reach a certain point the rest of the mountain cliff seems to blend into itself but you do  notice there are two maybe fivefoot wide very thin switchback paths that lead up the side of the  mountain  taliesin oh look we have two options for our ways up  liam two paths percy  taliesin two paths i want to examine the path to 
none	 see if theres one thats been more trod  liam lets choose the one less travelled then  taliesin that wont make much of a difference  matt were cultured  laughter  taliesin 14  matt 14 glancing at the two sides the left path appears to be far more worn the right path is  largely untouched with a thin layer of ash coating it so you get the feeling that one hasnt  seen use in quite some time  taliesin are the prints going both directions or is there a majority going one or the other 
none	  matt on the left side they seem to go both ways but even those prints are fairly old at least a  week or two has seen any sort of traction on the path  taliesin footprints horse prints both  matt footprints  taliesin no horse prints  matt correct  liam what do you see percival  taliesin i see the path is probably too treacherous to bring the horses we might want to  leave them here one path has barely been touched the other one has been pretty well ridden through  i say we 
none	 take the more common path  marisha all right  matt so you leave your horses behind okay  liam are there trees to tie them up  matt there are some trees towards the edge here  laura wait why are we taking the more travelled one do you think your family is more reclusive  marisha our tribe we generally can still make contact and trade with nearby towns generally  there might be more travelled ones once again im not sure  liam yeah the one that keyleths people or cousins or whatever they are have been 
none	 taking  marisha yeah lets try the path more travelled first  matt so you guys leave your horses behind you tie them up to one of the nearby trees one thats  off to the side leave a little bit of feed for them  laura we tied them  matt okay you make your way up the switchback path up the side of the mountain it is  relatively steep it continues up at about a 40degree incline and there are certain moments  where it tends to pinch to about a twofootwide path and you have to 
none	 uncomfortably put your back  to the side of the mountain to get through those passes youre about id say about an hour and a  half two hours later the sun has officially set and what little bit of moonlight would be brought  forth is currently encased by the thunderstorm ahead and you do still hear the occasional clap  of thunder and see the occasional flash that almost seems to be happening above the range out  of visual sight  liam i think we need light so we dont go over the edge  orion sure 
none	 igniting sound  matt tiberius creates a beacon of light at the edge of his staff and being centrally located to  the team is a fairly good source of visual light to the pathway you guys continue to go up the  side im going to go ahead and have everybody do a constitution saving throw here  marisha druid dice not good  orion 18  taliesin 13  marisha nine  laura nine  ashley 17  travis 18  matt this isnt a chillbased thing the air itself the wind thats blowing down is filled  
none	 with this thick ashtype dust thats coming through here youre finding yourself coughing  its getting into your lungs a little bit  taliesin ive got a mask for this im going to put on the mask  matt okay you pull your mask down  laura i pull my hood up  matt no immediate effects but you find yourself unable to suppress an occasional cough you  continue up the side of the mountain you guys pull your cloth up over your faces you make your  way its pushing almost midnight at this point in time and 
none	 youre getting tired your legs are  growing sore from the constant perpetual walk upwards at an angle the path begins to become less of  a switchback and you can see its beginning to pull inwards towards what looks like a ravine in  the mountain range theres an area where the actual mountain carves inward and leads into the  mountain range proper during that time vex as you guys are making your way up to this slight  inward path and it starts pushing into the mountain range less dangerous and less pressed  against the mountain 
none	 as you were previously you notice up at the top there are a few shadowed  figures just out of your visual range that you can just make out over the backlight of the clouds in  the sky  laura do they look  matt you can make a perception check  laura fuck i chose poorly thats terrible yeah eight  matt eight at this distance its hard to really make out any sort of visual on their form their  size but you just see theres a handful of them and it looks like three figures that 
none	 are moving in  unison along the ridge a little ways up ahead of you guys  laura shut up  matt can i go ahead and get a stealth check from the group with disadvantage on the ones that  failed their constitution saves  marisha how do we know if we failed  matt the fail is the nine or below yeah ill let you know if its a fail or not but you guys  everyone has to make a stealth check and the ones who currently have the coughs have disadvantage on  the roll  
none	 marisha who has the coughs how do we know  travis your clanging armor didnt do nothing  marisha did i fail with a nine  matt with a nine yes you did youre also coughing  marisha oh my god  orion 22  taliesin 11  marisha 14  matt 14  travis 21  laura whoa  ashley 19  all whoa  ashley i have been oiling my armor  travis she didnt have disadvantage she rolled a 17 on her constitution  matt right so you were fine  liam how did trinket do  
none	 laura 15 i did not roll for trinket for either of those things  matt go ahead and roll stealth on trinket  liam mighty two  travis a mighty two  laura youre so annoying  travis you know you dont have to breathe all of it in every time  liam oh right no 15 sorry 15 for stealth right  matt for stealth  liam coughs loudly  matt as you guys make your way into the path and she points this out theres a couple people that  kind of theres a quiet silence and then 
town	 coughing a couple of coughs coming through  shushed as best you can you can see the figures shift and then vanish from sight  travis should we hurry what do you think  laura well they know now  marisha im going to do a perception check and see if i can see any sign of a village or a town  or my people 23  matt looking around the pathway still continues upward and it continues and then disappears over  a ridge where the mountains come inward to the closest portion where the mountain range tends 
none	 to  break you cant see anything beyond that because its still too far away from you  marisha knowing my people and my tribe would i know if these were centurions  matt you have no idea you havent been to this territory you know that centurions usually are  sent out and people keep watch on the landscape around but you have no idea  travis because i know the mountains are we still on that crappy narrow precipice  matt that crappy path is starting to move inward finally towards the actual mountain its starting  to 
none	 crest over into the top area where it goes into almost more like a ravine where the two walls  of the mountain come together to give you a small valley path that leads  travis could i look and see if there are any boulder avalanchetype situations that i can  see  matt sure make a perception check  liam can i clarify something am i giving scanlan a shoulderride right now or is he knocking boots  back in vasselheim  matt yeah scanlan paid well for enough attention to celebrate his current  nonfreezingdeath or smashing 
none	 by a dragon hes still recovering through the positive  reinforcement of numerous female workers  liam yes i call it a tiefling trio  travis theres going to be art for that  taliesin dont say things like that out loud  matt do you guys continue  taliesin i think so  laura can i i mean  marisha lets continue on  matt all right you continue pushing in and this area where the mountain range tends to collide to  this path that then leads on its slowly winding around and heading upward and closer and 
none	 closer in  towards where the mountain range crests theres a couple more flashes of lightning some thunder  and you all look around  orion i rolled an 18 because i want to do an arcana check for anything i can feel from that  storm  matt 18 best you can gather the storm is localized it is not moving and this type of  storm seems to be more generated not because there is a gathering of storm activity or any natural  rain that falls in this area and in fact most of the rock and 
none	 landscape you see here is very  dry this usually accompanies a place of very strong power natural occurrences where there is a  funnel or focus of some sort of unbridled arcane or divine energy tends to call this type of  aberrant weather pattern to it  marisha this would sometimes happen at the air ashari as well wed get windstorms occasionally  it happens  matt you hear a strange clacking sound and you glance up just in time to see a large boulder  booming sounds down the mountain so for this one in particular this 
none	 would be towards the  people that are in front that would be keyleth vex vax and trinket  marisha do i have enough time to react  matt you guys can go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw  orion how big is the boulder  matt its roughly six feet in diameter it barrels through the vicinity  marisha 23  matt one  orion can i try to do something right now  matt well let them do the reaction first  laura what was my number it was 13 13 for me and trinket gets 
none	 13 as well  matt 13 and 13  orion can i try and do something  matt as soon as i finish their action basically the boulder smack and they all tried to dodge  out of the way and then you can do your action  orion im going to try to cast telekinesis and whoosh  matt okay the casting of the spell itself takes a moment its one of those things where its not  an instant thing you have to do the motions for it its not so much instant however as the  boulder 
none	 manages to roll by all of you except for vax manage to roll out of the way in time  everyone ducked out as the boulder trucks past you take 16 points of bludgeoning damage as the  boulder slams into your side  marisha 60  marisha matt and taliesin 16  matt you immediately glance up to the top and you can now see three figures have gathered at the  very top of this ridge and you can see two more are lifting boulders  travis lifting boulders  laura oh are they giants are they more 
none	 fucking giants  matt glancing up best you can see and theyre about 45 to 50 feet up on this ridgeline  they appear to be larger than normal humans they are humanoid you with your highest perception  glance up and you can see each one has two heads across one set of shoulders straining noises  laura can we get in a place that boulders wont hit us if we get right up against the cliff  face  matt you can certainly try  orion so now we see that happening  matt you guys all see 
none	 this happening now  orion cool so as i see the next one i cast telekinesis on the one hes about to throw and  huck it right back at him  matt okay one of the boulders gets loosed now this ones coming towards the bottom group here as  tiberius you reach up and do that go ahead and roll a strength check with the strength of the  boulder which i believe is muttering whats the strength check on this boulder  marisha how far away are they roughly  matt theyre about 45 to 50 feet 
none	 up on the pathway  travis we could just bolt were at the bottom of the valley  matt all right so you just roll and add five roll and add five to your d20  orion okay that was 15  matt 15 he rolled a five even with his strength bonus he throws the boulder down the boulder  smacks him right back in the face you can see he just groans tips over backward out of visual  range there are now two of them currently visible at the top all right so go ahead and make 
none	 your  attack the rest of you guys get a round however at this point in time as you guys are preparing the  second boulder comes crashing down towards the second half i need percy pike grog and  tiberius to make dexterity saving throws  marisha do you guys want to run  orion nope got a solid five  matt dexterity saving throw five  laura 14 on the first one  taliesin 18  matt okay 14 is fine  travis 13  ashley 15  matt 15 okay all but tiberius you guys dodge out 
none	 the way tiberius whos concentrating on the  telekinesis impact noise the secondary boulder unfortunately connects you take 12  points of bludgeoning damage i need you to make a concentration check roll a d20 add five to it  orion thats 24  matt 24 yeah you maintain concentration as it almost knocks you off your side you manage to  grunts maintain your focus on the spell your telekinesis is still going  laura i try to hit him with an arrow  matt go for it  laura 16  matt 16 hits you go flying arrow 
none	 you loose it and it goes hurtling up the side through the  darkness and it finds purchase somewhere in the face of the entity go ahead and roll damage  laura yeah 17  matt 17 nice  laura i didnt hunters mark him  taliesin is the entity still lifting boulders  matt there are two entities currently that are still up one you cant see because it got the  boulder smashed back into its face  travis as much as i like being targets for their lawn bowling we are in the bottom of a fucking 
none	  valley  marisha yeah were in a death pit man  ashley run  matt you guys just run okay you start bolting forward heavy steps you can see the two  entities now reach over and grab rocks and start running  ashley run zigzags  marisha i turn around where they are right in front and throw up a big wall of stone  matt they both throw boulders overhead now arcing missing the entire ravine trying to get it  downward  orion is my thing still going  matt your telekinesis is still going yeah 
none	  orion im going to catch one and whoosh  marisha dont take out my wall of stone  orion no im going to whack the dude  matt one of them rolls down and it would have impacted except for the wall of stone it hits  let me see the strength of that oh it rolled a one on its strength the boulder slams right at  the bottom of the ravine gets even more speed as it ramps up like a bowling ball and slams into the  stone wall the stone wall impact noise heaves and 
none	 cracks and portions of it fall and collapse  but it does manage to stop the force of that boulder the second one comes overhead towards  you go ahead and make a d20 roll and add five to it  orion 19  matt 19 yeah i rolled an eight you manage to straining catch the boulder its just on the  cusp of the weight limit you would have on telekinesis but you manage to stop it in midair  and catch it youre just throwing it off to the side  orion no im going to huck 
none	 it right back to the other guy again swish whoosh  matt okay its a heavy boulder and its a long 50foot distance away so im going to go ahead and  have you roll another d20 plus five  orion thats 14  matt 14 you manage to stop it from crushing your party and you throw it up and it manages to roll  up the side get partway up and then continue arcing and rolling down away from you guys  safely skee ball style  marisha running  laura i pat tiberius on the back as 
none	 i pull him along run  matt you guys keep running you notice as youre bolting forward the two entities that are  looming reach over and  taliesin okay im going to stop if i see one pick up a ball im going to stop and take an  action if thats okay  matt sure go for it  taliesin im going to swing around im going to pull bad news out as i swing around back myself  down and im taking an aimed shot at its arm  matt okay go for it youre spending a 
none	 grit point  taliesin spending a grit point its been so long there we are yeah oh the curse is broken  thats 29 31  matt 31 definitively hits  taliesin 31  matt what does the arm shot do its no damage right  taliesin the arm shot is okay sorry its been a while ive never done this one before no  damage but it drops one item of my choice  matt so as its lifting the boulder you fire and it hits the elbow out from under it  taliesin and i use the strength 
none	 of the shot to pick myself up and keep on running  matt okay go ahead and make an acrobatics check so as one of them is lifting a giant boulder  taliesin 23  matt 23 youre fine percy swings around fires bad news that echoes through the entire ravine  echoing gunshot acting as a sound focus you hear it echoing outward from the blast that sends  percy back but percy turns around throws his arm down on the ground and using the momentum from  the blast picks himself up leaps onto his feet and continues 
none	 running in time with the rest of  you a trail of smoke billowing behind him from the barrel of bad news which you can see is now  glowing with a bit of red warmth the metal itself heated from the sheer force of the blast at this  time you look up and see one of the entities with the two heads is lifting a boulder over its head  one of its elbows gunshot out from under it collapsing sound as it collapses onto its head  and that one also falls out of view as the 
none	 other one looks back and sets the boulder down starts  shaking its fists at the air angry grunting  marisha laughs rabble rabble  travis in giant i call back fuck you  matt in giant  travis i dont know if it is a giant it had two heads  taliesin that felt really good  matt you recognize the echoing voice it says come back here food but you shout that back at  it it goes hey you guys have just charged at which point the ravine begins to open into what  looks like a 
none	 let me get a little out of this chaos here the ravine opens up into a valley it  looks like the top of this mountain range the top crested area surrounds this valley that slowly  descends into the center of this large mountain you guys have walked up the outside of it  orion a hidden valley  ashley hidden valley ranch sorry it sounds so stupid  laughter  matt the valley itself is roughly three miles across to the other side of this crested mountain  range  marisha three miles  matt yeah you notice 
none	 this valley is actually a settledin bowllike caldera you realize this  particular mountain was once or possibly still is an active volcano as you begin to move in  closer the ground itself becomes more and more jagged with what looks like broken obsidian rock  sharp volcanic stone and glass it is a very warm heat that this area tends to give off and the  temperature is now significantly causing you to sweat not just from the run but the severe  change in temperature from what youre used to in this area of the continent  
none	 orion this feels great to me im stretching out my scales letting the heat in oh yeah thats  good  matt the air now the burning wooden ash smell is becoming much stronger and you readjust your  cloth to cover your mouth you also as you begin to push closer and closer towards the center you  begin to see occasional pools of ashy mud dotting the landscape where sulfurous gas caused the  liquid earth to bubble and fume in certain patches  orion lady keyleth is that you oh its  ashley oh are we  
none	 matt everyone go ahead and roll perception  orion as they are doing this with their noses im going to open my bottle of air and just have  it soft spraying sound  marisha ooh 28  taliesin 15  ashley 13  laura 12 man  liam one  laura what is our rolls tonight  marisha twinsies twinsies rolls  orion that is a negative two  matt laughing okay  orion there see  liam take that game take that  matt far off in the distance keyleth as the rest of you look at the 
none	 landscape you see what  looks like a small forest a very localized forest right in the center of the valley you can see a  cluster of trees that exists about a mile a mile and a half away from your current position as you  guys continue pushing forward you start seeing larger stone clusters and formations almost like  a very violent activity were forcing and jutting up portions of stone out of this caldera at some  point  marisha can i do a nature check to see if its natural from earthquakes or if earthbenders 
none	 have  done it 25  matt looking at it it appears that a lot of it appears to be natural but there are portions that  appear to be sculpted or have sections that are cleaved off or taken by possible tools for use of  building or other purposes  marisha and most of it appears to be obsidian  matt obsidian volcanic rock which is very porous and light and somewhat brittle in  places and occasionally you see sections of glass smooth glass that fill pockets across the  ground as you get about half a 
none	 mile to threequarters of a mile into this caldera  towards that forest you were seeing in the distance there is a loud grinding of stone out of  nowhere this grinding sound all of you glance around as suddenly whooshing a series of stone  walls rise out of the ground surrounding you front back side to side and a fifth one closes  the top off you are now left in complete darkness imprisoned in what seems to be some sort  of a stone cube  orion what light sound effect  travis oh my god  
none	 orion sorry  laura really bright in here  matt as you look around indeed relatively roughlooking stone walls have completely  encapsulated you guys on all five sides you are all entirely trapped inside the structure about 40  feet high and 40 feet across  laura we dig we dig down can we dig  orion i think a fireball can do this no im just kidding  travis i take the warhammer activate it and run up towards the walls and swing as hard as i can  into one of the walls  matt okay go 
none	 ahead and roll a strength check  travis strained wince  ashley can i assist  matt laughs if you want to you rush up with you mace as well  travis 19  ashley oh you dont need assistance  travis yeah i do from pike anytime  laura and ashley nine  matt so the two of you together slam your  weapons into the side of the wall a portion of  the stone cracks a little and chips fall out but the stone still stands pretty solidly  liam everybody stop keyleth  marisha can i 
none	 see through it where they chipped away  matt where they chipped away theres still more stone behind youre not sure how thick these  walls are  liam we just wait or keyleth talks wait  matt about a moment later you see a small red glow appear from a portion of the wall on the  opposite side red glow looking like a portion of the stone about this wide begins to glow bright  red before dripping off molten leaving a small slit you can now see through the slit a few  heads appearing as one 
none	 steps into eyes shifting peering through the small space you trespass  into our home i will ask you once your business before we let the mountains fury take you  marisha please i am keyleth of the air ashari and i am here to further my aramente  matt he looks back for a second go ahead and make a persuasion roll with advantage  liam i kneel down toward keyleth  laura and i bow  taliesin yeah  marisha and i look around and im like  matt so  marisha persuasion  matt with advantage  
none	 laura can we assist  liam were doing it  marisha persuasions not good ten  orion i dont bow im still at her side  matt you guys have all kneeled around her there is a moment where they all look about themselves  so keyleth of the air ashari you know of our people you trek up here with a group of strangers  at your sides welcome weapons at the ready i ask you for the aramente whom do you call family  whom gave you to this world  marisha my father korren and my mother 
none	 vilya my mother was my predecessor wait no thats  right yes predecessor  orion yes your highness  marisha she followed in my path im following in her path  matt the eyes have now moved away from the slot  marisha damn it god im so bad at being eloquent  matt a moment later you hear a large stone crushing a large impact sound and a voice  say stand back  laura how  ashley for what  travis we all back up  matt as you all back away the front wall of stone that 
dung	 was put up before you that the eyes  were looking through suddenly crashing crumbles into a pile on its own revealing the caldera  before you once again there stand about ten individuals all dressed in what looks like dark  brown and black hides and leathers with sections of what looks like obsidiantipped weapons  certain arrows are cocked at the ready against the rest of you and one individual the one that was  speaking to you earlier comes forward you see all of these people they are from varying races  dwarves halflings humans about three 
none	 halfelves among them when an elven man comes forth and you  recognize through the eyes and the tone of voice this is the one that spoke to you through the slit  in the stone he has no hair completely bald of all hair tattooed darkness around his eyes and  you can see his entire left arm is covered in a longhealed but horrible burn scar he steps up  and gives you a nod of affirmation then you shall tell this to the flamespeaker if you are  indeed ashari he will know what to do with 
none	 you come with us  marisha and what might i ask is your name  matt glances back over his shoulder calhoun but im not the one you wish to speak with  orion hi im tiberius stormwind  matt he turns around and continues walking back towards the forest  marisha let me do all the talking this time  laura would you like us to follow you your majesty  marisha oh you dont yes family my brothers and sisters  laura got it  matt you guys continue walking alongside keyleth and as you do most of 
none	 the druids flank you to  each side about four of them with arrows still drawn walking behind you as you progress they  are still armed and keeping a close eye on you as you travel  laura this is really not necessary  marisha just let them do it  matt calhoun leads the way and you guys continue traveling for about half an hour or so until  eventually you begin to reach an area where you see more of these rock structures but many of  them have been carved out or a series of stones 
town	 have been gathered to build small huts and abodes  you can see this is essentially a village built from all the materials that were scavenged from or  brought to this caldera to construct pyrah the realm of the fire ashari  as you move through the town silence still claims the entirety of the druids that are escorting you  with calhoun leading the way you can see other druids begin coming out of their abodes glancing  around and watching you as you approach no scowls no smiles just a general air of  indifference amongst them 
none	 as they carefully watch the strange outsiders stepping through their  homestead you are then led through the village to the outskirts of this forest now the forest you  see as you get closer all the trees are long dead and petrified there is not a leaf among  them and most of the wood you see is either gray or black from being charred burned or dying over  time and being petrified as you head towards the edge of the forest calhoun stops and turns around  and just crosses his arms and stares at you  
none	 sh  at which point the ground explosion shudders and you can see in the distance from within the  forest almost you see a large spray of molten rock disappear into the loose canopy of the burned  trees before you some sort of brief volcanic eruption seems to have sprayed out from the center  of this cluster of dead trees about 20 seconds later you see a shape begin to emerge from the  dead forest stepping out of the shadows you see a man standing there human very thick sturdy  build no shirt brasscolored bracers 
dung	 long billowing pants of a deep maroon color with gold  trim and designs his skin is very darkened whether by blood or by sun he has a very dark  complexion to him his hair is long and jet black you see his jaw is very square and his cold black  eyes show no emotion as he ignores the rest of you and steps toward keyleth heavy footsteps he  walks right up to you now hes looking down at you hes standing probably a good foot and a half  taller once again no emotion no expression 
none	 you are kin of vilya are you  marisha im king of vilya  orion kin  marisha oh kin of vilya yes i am  matt i am cerkonos the flamespeaker of pyrah the guardian of this rift welcome to pyrah my  child i must ask why have you come  marisha i am here to complete my aramente i have already been to the earth tribe  matt he crosses his arms for a moment  marisha my mother vilya never returned to zephra  matt for you to be here on your aramente it is proof 
none	 that she did not complete hers or at least  is no longer with us i am sorry she was strong of heart  marisha so she came through here  matt she did she completed the trial the challenges and moved on to continue her aramente  about ten or so years back  marisha only ten years ago shes been gone for close to 20  laura how long was she here  marisha yes how long was she here  matt she stayed naught but three or four days and then her journey took her id hoped 
none	 wherever  she was she was safe  laura can i check him to see if he is telling the truth 22  matt he seems stern but honest his words genuinely come from a place of worry and a tinge  of regret at the knowledge that hes just received your mother was strong of heart and was very  fierce she could stir the heart of the mountains themselves with a word she was very well  respected amongst us  marisha she was better than i am  matt i hope not at this moment his face 
none	 becomes a little darker and he says korren i  assume he is well  marisha he is as stubborn as always  matt laughs well you come with compatriots you trust them  marisha yes these are my traveling companions vox machina theyve proven themselves time and  time again weve been together for almost over a year now  matt do you trust them  marisha i do we actually have a keep now in emon  matt good youll need trust you are here to learn then for your aramente to be tested yes  marisha correct 
none	  matt then speak what youve learned to seek what you wish to learn what do you lack what  will be your death  marisha i have actually seen a vision of my death from not having the will to do what is  necessary for fear of harming others instead of protecting myself  matt then the test begins now without preparation do you also wish to join her in this  task  travis and taliesin yes  matt for the first time you see a smile across his face beneath it you can see the gleaming 
none	  white toothy grin of the man that acknowledges some sort of honor then the trial shall  commence come within cindergrove he turns around and heads back into the forest the rest of  the druids have stepped back now theyve left you to your own devices  travis a vision of your death  marisha part of one of the ceremonies that the earth tribe gives is called the alore ceremony  its a tea that they make that is derived from a local plant that its essentially a vision quest  tea it gives you visions its 
none	 a cultural tradition i guess i saw two paths one was an  older woman who was wise and hardened and brave and she had a line of young ashari behind her and  i ran away i feel like she was me and i ran away and i went down another path there was a  tree it was young but strong and it had a familiarity as i reached out and touched it my  vision was taken through the path of the roots and i could see the world and i could see how  everything was 
none	 connected and it took me to you all and you were strong and fighting and proud  and then vax yelled out this one is for keyleth i wasnt with you and then grog yelled  out this is for our princess and it broke away and i realized that i was that tree and it  was my death and as i ran to the other side i went back to the old woman and all of my people  slowly started fading behind her and as she looked at me she said your future is as  important 
none	 as it is fragile protect it and she too faded away i realized she was me and when i  came out of my vision i talked with the earth headmaster patisse and she told me that if i was  going to survive i needed to have the will to do what was necessary and the strength and ever  since the child its been hard i was there for a long time at the earth tribe longer than most  stay on their aramente i couldnt get through the trial every time i used a natural magic every 
none	  time i tried to fight i just saw flashes of that childs eyes i was blocked normally they save  the alore ceremony for the final testament but they actually started me with the alore ceremony  in order to help hopefully unlock my spiritual blocking that i was having but i dont know  orion so what now your highness  marisha continue on and hope i dont make a fatal mistake hope that i can learn  orion we wont let that happen  marisha i hope i dont let you guys down  taliesin we face 
none	 this together  matt explosion theres another shake of the ground as you see another spray of molten rock  spraying and you hear pattering in the distance of the forest  laura well do this together  travis were with you to the end  marisha i love you all  matt you all move together into the cindergrove forest pushing through the hardened blackened  tree trunks to the left and the right of you the actual floor of the forest what appears to be  piles and piles of burntaway brush ash and whatever else once was 
none	 considered life amongst the  boughs of these trees when they grew there eventually you find your way to the center of the  forest and you can see now the source of these molten rock sprays there is a large crevasse  bisecting the center of the forest about 35 to 40 feet across and about five feet wide that is a  pool of slowly roiling lava you can see the actual air around it is heavily warped by this  intense heat thats being released and all the trees that are immediately around it are all  
none	 warped and bent and have been burnt to near lack of recognition standing there amongst the edge  of it is cerkonos with his arms crossed trained on you keyleth you see occasionally a couple of  bubbles lava bubbling in the lava behind him and even his form is shifting from behind as the  air itself ripples and changes he looks at you and says sit focus ask permission  marisha i do as he says  matt go ahead and make a wisdom check roll a d20 add your wisdom bonus  marisha 27  matt 27 
none	 as you sit down and close your eyes you begin to focus your mind towards the center of  this mountain the heart of the fire that gives it its life and as you all watch a minute passes of  silence before suddenly the ground shifts again and you can see the lava begin to grow more and  more active sending off little spittles of rock  marisha i push it out and continue to focus  matt you guys begin to see now the lava is shifting and beginning to roil and youre almost  afraid its 
none	 going to start bubbling over and fill the area and this nervousness grips your heart  especially you vax who had previously had some unhappy runins with molten rock its a genuine  fear that you hadnt quite acknowledged since that moment and you begin to feel really uncomfortable  being this close to this opening as you continue to focus you hear cerkonoss voice again calm  and methodical ask permission id like you to go ahead and roll a nature check  marisha 19  matt 19 rock scraping the ground shifts again you can now watch the 
none	 lava strangely enough its  beginning to billow upward but not spill over the edges of the crevasse its actually slowly  circling you hear this strange sucking sound almost like sludge is being pulled through a tube  and the lava beginning to slowly spin and spin cerkonos is still the back of him you can only  imagine is either burnt to a crisp by the sheer proximity of the heat but he is unmoved  marisha i push it out and continue to focus just focus and meditate on asking permission  matt keyleth of the air 
none	 ashari ask permission go ahead and roll one more wisdom check d20 plus  five this time with advantage  marisha oh my god i rolled the same thing twice wisdom five 18  matt 18 at this point you guys notice one final shift of the ground and the trees actually crack  and you see bits of broken branch and tree begin to fall and hit the ground around you the air is  beginning to pick up and even though you try and cover your face the ash is still pushing through  and your eyes are 
none	 starting to hurt you feel suddenly this blockage this tension like the  mountain was fighting you give way and in that moment you gasps breathe in and open your eyes  and you all notice that the lava that has been slowly circling now whoosh pulls down into a  vortex that disappears into the crevasse and is now a spinning whirlpool of molten rock in the  crevasse as cerkonos still stands there cerkonos now steps aside and seems to vanish from your  sight in but an instant his voice lingering in the air saying now you 
none	 may enter looking  down you lean over and you can see this slow spiral of molten rock it seems to disappear 15 to  20 feet below you cannot see the bottom of it and when you try and lean forward the heat is so  intense that you have to close your eyes youre forced to there is a leap of faith here  marisha before i leap down i cast protection from flame on myself or protection from energy  and im going to use fire  matt which gives you fire resistance  marisha gives me 
none	 fire resistance  matt okay good to know and then keyleth  marisha i close my eyes and let myself fall  matt you guys watch as keyleth steps forward and tumbles off the edge into the vortex of molten  rock whoosh shes gone  liam i look to my sister and grab her by the shoulder and squeeze then i dive in  laura oh shit are we doing this  matt make a wisdom saving throw as this is fighting a very strong fear of yours  ashley because we had the heroes feast are we not 
none	 frightened  marisha oh my god thats true you have advantage on all of our wisdom saving throws from  the heroes feast  liam 16  matt okay you shrug it off and the thought of your sister the thought of keyleth the thought  of the moments of connection you guys have had you push through that pain and you leap and swan  dive into the vortex  orion i cast stoneskin whoosh  matt you leap off tiberius dives in as well all of you guys jump in you dont need to roll  anything it 
none	 was only because of his fear he had to the rest of you leap into this vortex  laura trinket jump come i smack him on the butt and i jump in after him  matt and trinket roaring leaps in looking over his shoulder at you like what have you done  laura youre brave very brave  matt as you all individually leap through its interesting theres a falling sensation and then  gravity seems to shift youre facing downward but you feel gravity begin to pull you to the  side and your feet find purchase on 
none	 what seems like the lava spiral but it doesnt burn you  step on it like its hard rock shifting slowly beneath your feet where you have to continuously  change your step like a slowly rotating tunnel youre walking through and youre walking  downward downward this way and you see light before you very bright light and you move  towards it and move towards it and your eyes try and focus and you cover your vision and  eventually you step out of this tunnel and it takes a moment for your eyes to focus and looking 
none	  around you you see a vast barren wasteland of black cinders embers and ash for miles and  miles around you thin rivers of lava cut across the plains like blood splatter  marisha oh my god were in the plane of fire  matt the wind blows extremely strongly and the atmosphere is dry and nearly unbearably hot like  the hottest desert youve ever imagined an intolerably blazing sun is coming to rest near a  distant mountain range but your eyes catch an even more distant danger a black roiling  cinderstorm a few miles off 
none	 red lightning flashing within its turbulent ash clouds it looks  to be moving away from you thankfully but you do indeed find yourself standing in the center of the  elemental plane of fire a voice echoes from behind you and you look over your shoulder and  you can see there is a circular doorway still held aloft there shifting slowly the vortex you  stepped out of still locked in place a voice says stay together follow the footsteps when  you find the stone spire there you will find your trial  marisha okay  orion 
none	 just to note when i cast stoneskin i didnt do the concentration i let go of the alter  self  matt right that was illusion dust so its fine  laura well we follow footsteps i can track footprints  marisha okay sure yeah he might mean more metaphorically im not sure it could be either  its hard to tell can i sit and take a minute to meditate and see if i can connect with my mother  and see if i can find some sort of trace essence  matt make another wisdom check  laura 
none	 and i want to use primeval awareness  marisha i have advantage right ill take that 15 thank you it was a one so thats 28  laura can i use primeval awareness to see if theres any aberrations celestials elementals  fiends undead any scary things dragons within six miles no a mile  matt you sense there is a very very faint comfort in this path so you know its been walked  before youre unable to glean anything beyond that but you know youre on the right path but  your mothers been gone a long time 
none	 surprising youve even caught wind of this type of an essence  lingering  marisha any direction of which way the essence might be blowing  matt its hard to tell make an investigation check you sense within the mile because its  not like blips on a radar you just generally sense something nearby in three different  directions elemental presence strong elemental presence you glance up very strong elemental  presence as all of you can see about a quarter mile half mile away you see theres something  drifting in the sky that is burning like a 
none	 beacon  travis what  marisha its a fire elemental  matt what did you roll  marisha 16  matt 16 glancing about trying to gather a sense of direction you look and notice that theres no  footsteps theres no sign of any sort of stepping the wind that blows through here and  theres a strong wind and all of you are having to keep your eyes closed and arms up to try and  block your vision from the wind and it is a perpetual difficulty to even just breathe here  every inhale burns the 
none	 inside of your lungs  orion oh pop  matt there you go tiberius has a big old bottle in his mouth now like a magical pacifier and  youve got your mask on which is helping it is still very hot here and under all the armor  youre wearing you immediately break into a very heavy sweat you notice though that through your  investigation and the connection with your mother and the directional sense while there are no  tracks there are small pools of lava that progress in a pattern one that would even  resemble 
none	 footsteps of a giant or some sort of large creature  marisha lets head that way lets follow this lava trail looks promising  travis were behind you  matt all right you guys begin pushing forward blazing sun bearing down on you heading towards  the direction of these pools of lava and they scatter a bit but there is a general direction  you are able to follow  laura quietly theres no way to stealth here is there cover ourselves in ash or something to  make us less visible  matt what are you doing  
none	 laura is it possible to cover us in ash and try to make us less visible to the elementals  matt you can certainly try  marisha do you have pass without a trace right now  laura i do have pass without a trace i can cast that on us  matt okay so you cast pass without a trace on the group as you do the magic pools a bunch of  the ashes whoosh from the ground surround each of you and theres this gentle cloud of ash that  just tends to drift off your body 
none	 and perpetually replace itself from the surrounding terrain it  does offer you some blanket of visual obscuring from any sort of high vantage point or distant  vantage point up close not so much ill have all of you guys roll a stealth check with a plus  ten bonus from the spell  liam cloak of elvenkind is with advantage would that take place here  matt it would yes  marisha 25  travis 17  taliesin 19  ashley 23  matt with the disadvantage because you have heavy armor on  ashley let me do

none	  familiar with the training the elemental plane of fire does seem to be a very prominent home to such  dragons as the red you guys notice this and stop in place and keep low as time passes eventually  it moves past heading towards the distant mountain range thank god you cast that spell you  wait a little while until its out of sight and beyond your vision you keep pushing forward  another 20 to 30 minutes or so through this hellish landscape the heat is starting to get to  you guys i need everyone 
none	 to go ahead and make a constitution saving throw  orion 21  marisha do i get anything for having my protection from fire  matt ill say give you advantage for this  taliesin my mask doesnt give me any advantage does it  matt not for heat this is the general atmospheric heat  taliesin 11  liam 13  travis 20  ashley 13  matt you all are feeling the heat starting to get to you but currently it doesnt seem to be fully  affecting you you get the feeling the longer you stay here 
none	 the more its going to have an effect  on you however youre still pushing through without a problem you push on for another ten  minutes or so before you come across a few more of these streams of lava and there about 20 to 30  feet ahead of you you see a single stone obelisk that rises out of the ground about 15 feet up and  towards the top you see embedded in it a single mildly glowing what looks like a fist or  heartsized ruby that is embedded into it like a beacon or 
none	 a small fiery lighthouse in the center  of this open plain  laura thats pretty  marisha that looks like a stone spire to me  travis well its shiny  marisha its rather shiny yeah lets go there  matt all right as you guys approach stepping towards the obelisk around the back of it make a  perception check  laura 17  matt all right so as you begin to step forward you instinctively stop as you see figures step out  from behind the spire three normal humans in fact immediately you recognize stepping from 
none	  behind it is cerkonos and two of the other druids that you had accompany you into this cerkonos  walks towards you arms still crossed in front of the spire you see his wind being blown to the  side from the sheer force of the heated winds that are blowing through this barren landscape he  looks about the rest of you youve done well but there is not much time and he looks off to  the side and you can now see the cinderstorm that was once heading away has changed course and is  now 
none	 making its way in the direction of you and the spire you can see its probably about a half a  mile to a quarter mile off and you can see the red arcing bolts of energy floating through it  and its starting to darken the landscape beneath it show me what it is youve learned and with  that the form of all three druids suddenly burst into flames and grow in size cerkonos becoming  astronomically large for even the elementals youve encountered everybody roll initiative  groaning  marisha oh jesus ballsacks all right  taliesin

none	 goes and takes effect  orion as im going to do that im going to heighten it and spend three sorcerer points so  it gives him disadvantage  matt i will say because the blight spell is a scroll you cannot use metamagic its magic from  your bloodstream is what gives you that ability  orion fair enough  matt whats the dc on that  orion 17  matt 17 constitution rolled a 16 so no does not make it  cheering  orion so what i can do is i can if i cant heighten an

none	 matt all right go ahead and roll damage  marisha 2d8 not bad 12 plus four 16  matt 16 damage nice and he is grappled currently as you are swirling around him as this  vortex of water as you hit for the attack you do take six points of fire damage from being in the  midst of that flame  marisha does he take extra damage because im water because he has water susceptibility  matt water susceptibility essentially he takes one point of cold damage on top of that and if he  tries to moves 
none	 away from you he moves slower  orion youre swirling water around him right now  marisha its water versus fire elemental right now  matt however because it is a fire elemental it is immune to being grappled because it is just  fire you cant really grab around it  marisha well i just football tackle him impact water right through his form steam rolls  off of me hiss  matt and it is uncomfortable being in this plane as a water elemental but youre pushing through it  marisha i take how much four damage  
none	 matt that was six damage which should be halved because you have the resistance still on you so  thats three damage to you you also entered its space so you also are on fire strangely enough  you are a water elemental thats caught fire  liam water  matt its strange the water is steaming and the flames are having a hard time rolling im going  to say im going to say you cant thats stupid a water elemental is not going to catch  fire that makes no sense im going to say for the sake

none	 your arm and your hand burning you  you take ten damage from the first strike eight damage and because this is magical its not  reduced so thats 18 plus another ten 28 total points of fire damage from striking at it all  right that ends your turn grog up to the top of the round thats now come to cerkonos cerkonos  is going to stay right where it is its going to go ahead and make three melee touch attacks its  going to be probably going to be one against each of you actually so 
none	 against keyleth that is  a 24 to hit  marisha hits  matt so that would be 12 points of fire damage reduced to six because of your spell but youre  not ignited  liam against everyone near him  matt its doing an attack against each of you its just reaching out cocked dice that is 18  against you  liam hell yeah that hits  matt all right you take nine points of fire damage and against grog that is a natural 20  groaning  travis was that a crit  laura and liam

none	  laughter  ashley and laura singing 27  matt did hunters mark damage on the last one right  laura yes 16 with bloodseeking  matt nice so its now bleeding  laura hes a bleeding fireball  matt interesting thing about this i will consider bleeding as part of its conditional  immunities because it does not have blood it is a flaming elemental  laura waste  matt but it still took damage you can see now the flames of this are starting to flicker a  little bit its having hard time keeping itself cohesive  
none	 travis on the smaller one  matt yeah that ends your turn do you want to move anywhere you staying there  laura im going to go around the back of the wall with trinket oh no i knocked it down on myself  can i get around to the other side  matt thats as far as you can get with your run right now unfortunately  laura okay thats cool  matt okay that ends your turn tiberius youre up  marisha dont worry about hurting me if thats what youre afraid of  orion okay im going

none	 two  orion if i have to move can i move closer to hit  matt youd have to get into melee with this to hit all three which would be disadvantage if its an  attack roll  travis just take the two  orion ill take the two ill do that and then im going to spend three points to heighten the  spell and that gives them disadvantage on their saving throw so im going to do that right now  matt so whats the saving throw dex  orion 17  matt 17 dex okay go 
none	 ahead and roll damage and its half damage for that right  orion yeah if they save  taliesin thats pretty good  orion ten 18 whats that 30 35 35  matt 35 okay keyleth and grog also make dexterity saving throws  travis fair  matt two fails on cerkonos  marisha 17  travis 20  matt that is a natural 17 for the fire elemental though it takes half damage there so whats the  total on there  orion and that was at disadvantage  matt oh disadvantage natural 20 sorry well it still takes 
none	 half damage this elemental you  notice its form suddenly cracking freeze into ice and then shatter  cheering  matt below it you see standing in its place the druid that was once there thud drops down on  its knees and looks up at you with a nod  laura were coming back  matt whatd you roll with disadvantage on the saving throw guys by the way  marisha disadvantage  travis thats worse 14  marisha four  matt both of you guys take 35 points of cold damage cerkonos also takes 35 points of cold 
none	  damage all right cool thats tiberiuss turn this druid is going to go ahead and is going to  transform into an eagle and head back in the path from where you guys came from this guy is going  to move in there and is going to make two strikes against you pike natural 20  laura no  matt and thats a natural 18 plus six is 24 welcome back  laughter  ashley my armor class is 20 so they both hit me  matt thats a natural 18 plus six on top of that  
none	 ashley point taken  matt seven times two thats 14 plus three take 17 points of fire damage from the first strike  the second one does so 14 from both so total of 28 points of fire damage and you are ignited  all of a sudden your armor heats up and you see flames begin to lick up through the different  sections of the plate and the fire elemental is harrying right on top of you  taliesin singing oh that girl is smoking on fire  ashley singing this girl is on fire  laughter  
none	 matt and with that its percy and pikes turn  taliesin you first or me first  matt well percy at the top of your turn actually you both take  taliesin no i put myself out  matt thats right  taliesin take that soda can poptopper off me  ashley oh no wait my frost brand sword im resistant to fire damage  matt take 14 points of fire damage you also take what would be four is now two so a total of 16  points of fire damage  ashley 16 points okay wait so what 
none	 was it  travis and laura 16  liam reality is malleable here  matt as the actual protective energies of the frost brand gives this layer of cold across your  armor and reduces the impact youre still on fire but the fire is doing less damage to you  physically as the cold is counteracting it cool percy what are you doing  taliesin okay im pulling out the pepperbox and im taking an ice shot at the little one attacking  pike and im going to take a sharpshooter thats the wrong dice to roll im going 
none	 to take a  sharpshooter bonus for it so thats a miss thats a nine actually no shit god damn it  thats a misfire im going to spend an action to fix that  matt okay go ahead and roll the check on that if you could  taliesin oh what is the check on that thats a dc 12 eight nine ten 11 12 i hit my check  matt you just barely make it the gun is not broken as you spin you go to fire and something  about the trajectory of the bullet is off 
none	 and as you release the trigger all of a sudden the whole  front of the barrel cracking encases in ice and youre like crap and you have to chisel the ice  off  taliesin fire again  matt well it takes an action to try and  taliesin no i looked it takes an attack  matt then yes youre able to do that  taliesin if it goes then im  matt then it takes an action to fix it thats what it is yeah its an action to fix a broken  gun  taliesin yeah 
none	 action to fix a broken gun lets try it again without the sharpshooter bonus  better 20 to hit  matt 20 does hit yes  taliesin and i dont get the bonus on that because i suck seven points of damage  matt seven points of damage  taliesin rolled a one  matt sometimes it works out that way all right  taliesin and im going to back off  matt cannot use your attack again until an action it is an action  taliesin it is an action i thought it was an action to  matt 
none	 its an action to repair and then if it breaks you cannot use it until youre out of  combat  marisha did it break  taliesin it did break  matt it didnt break it jammed and then it managed to alleviate that  taliesin i would have switched guns anyways but okay next time for some reason i thought it was  an attack action  matt no worries thats the downside of the firearms so no damage you dont get your second  attack off as you take your full action  taliesin to fix it okay 
none	 thats fine it was shitty damage anyways hey i get to keep the  bullet  matt cool so that ends percys turn pike what are you doing  ashley percy where are you at in terms of hit points  taliesin im fine im at half im at 56  laura hes at 12  ashley i know hes at 12 can i get over to vax  matt youll not be able to get to him  laura sprinters boots  matt you could with your sprinters boots yeah  ashley sprinters boots  matt all right so 
town	 whoosh you get by there the fire elemental does get an attack of  opportunity on you and that is a 17 to hit armor class is 20 so as it reaches towards you it just  streaks off your armor impact the flames heat one of the plates below but you manage to pull out  before it can actually find any real aggressive attack on you  taliesin that was full road runner  ashley 29  matt so as pike rushes up to you and touches you on the side of your waist as you feel all 
none	 your  wounds and burn marks tend to subside and heal up instantaneously  liam oh yeah thats good  ashley thats a little bit of something  liam yeah ill take it  matt that ends pikes turn keyleth youre up  marisha all right im going to do a multiattack right on cerkonos so im going to do two  impacts with my big wavy arms  matt all right go for it  marisha so plus seven to hit so first one 18 so thats 20 okay and second one thats not as  good 19 sorry 
none	 18  matt 18 also hits  marisha okay cool so thats 2d8 plus four bludgeoning damage twice so thats five six so  thats ten nine plus another 13 23 points of damage  matt 23 points of damage your attacks in this form are considered magical correct so yeah it  doesnt do half damage its full damage because normally it would have resistance to bludgeoning  but because of your magical weapons because youre a crazy druid full 23 points of damage as  all of a sudden the elemental form starts slamming him with these giant 
none	 tidal wavelike fists  marisha oh plus an extra two because im a water elemental  matt there you go wham wham you can see steam is starting to billow off of cerkonoss  elemental form theyre both in this crazy tidal epic elemental throw down this is wwe style  orion oh no it must be stopped  matt are you going to stay where you are  marisha yeah im on his ass  matt all right that ends keyleths turn grog youre up  travis can i move around the backside of him without him getting an 
none	 attack of opportunity if i  stay just as close as i am now no  matt as soon as you dart off to the side hell get a strike on you  travis son of a bitch  taliesin can he do a onespace move without an attack  travis just because im cooking fuck it ill keep swinging im in a frenzied rage  matt go for it three strikes against cerkonos  travis thats a 20  liam natural 20  travis oh no a total of 20 19  matt hits  travis and a 22 
none	  matt hits all three hit  travis 11 17 and a 19  matt 19 whacks once again streaking into him mouth open roars the foam that would normally  be gathering at the side of your mouth though is just this dried crust on the side because theres  just all this heat in the air with each yell as you close your mouth you can taste the ash that  is coalesced on the back of your tongue its this terrible smell it would bother you if you werent  so focused in your furied rage in 
none	 this vicinity however you do take three points of fire damage  two points of fire damage and ten so a total of 15 points of fire damage from striking at it with  your axe as the fire blows back onto you also at the top of your turn because you were on fire you  took another eight points of fire damage from the flames burning and licking up your shoulders you  smell the scent of burning hair reach your nostrils  travis its because were family  liam it could be your pubes dont jump to 
none	 conclusions  matt that ends grogs turn hold on that your turn at the top cerkonos is going to angrily now  go into three more attacks one against keyleth two against grog because grogs starting to look  a little rough and the flames are affecting him more than its affecting keyleth he turns to slam  you twice that is a 26  travis thatll hit  matt nine plus eight that is a 17  travis misses  matt 19 plus eight thats a 27  travis oh i dont know if that hits or not  
none	 matt im sorry that ones against keyleth so one hits you one misses and the last one was 27  versus you  marisha yeah  matt so you take 11 points of fire damage from the strike you take ten points reduce that to  five so you take five points of fire damage that is cerkonoss turn that brings us to vax  liam okay so cerkonos is still busy with keyleth so im going to take a split second to  inhale exhale and then dagger noises right from where i am so 18  matt 18 
none	 hits  liam 14  matt hits  liam natural 20 for the third do i get to pick which one is the okay so the first one hit  which is sneak attack so that is four plus seven is 11 plus 14 17 23 25 31 for the first  hit second one which was a hit is which part gets doubled  matt just the dice roll  liam the dice roll four plus six is ten  matt all right so whoosh whoosh whoosh youre launching the daggers out and its  difficult to focus on 
none	 because there is currently this swirl of water and flame that is going  around as your third dagger hits you can see the elemental form shrinks and the water elemental  that is keyleth absorbs what you see now cerkonos in human druid form now floating aloft in the  center of keyleth as an elemental static take that microphone sorry guys impact and is  that your turn  liam thats it yeah thats it ill back up against the side of that wall thats right there  but thats it  matt okay vex  laura i 
none	 come around the side of the wall hi oh hey and i shoot at the other guy  matt all right go for it  laura is he within ten feet of anything  matt no  laura then im going to lightning arrow im going to hunters mark him  matt all right hunters mark is a bonus action  laura yes so im going to hail of thorns him  matt okay  laura yes 15  matt 15 that does hit  laura yes 17 plus four so thats 21 plus 3d10 14  matt all righty 
none	 as you come around the corner  releasing the arrow it slams into the  side of the elemental bursts into it you can see the splinters shooting throughout its form  sending out all these little fiery sparks as all the thorns burst into flames from the contact with  the body which then diminish and burn away into ash in the middle of the air  laura take two that one doesnt hit though  matt what was that  laura 13  matt 13 just hits  cheering  matt dont have huge ac  laura yay 
none	 16 20  matt 20 all right impact the arrow hits and then bursts and gets caught into its form before  it eventually gets expelled it is just this tiny flaming shaft that ends your turn all righty  that brings us to tiberius at the top of your turn you take ten points of fire damage reduced  to five from the flames that are burning on your body  orion and i turn to the fire elemental because theyre coherent right im like do you really  need me to do this i ask it the question 
none	  matt currently the elemental is just in the middle of its just an amorphous flaming mass  laura hes like one of those creatures at a gas station  laughter  orion fine so i go glacial blast with my finger hiss  matt okay for its saving throw it rolls an 18 whats your dc on that  orion 17  matt so half damage go ahead and roll for the targeted blast  orion 14  marisha 14 17 18 plus six so its 24 plus another eight so thats 32  orion 32  matt 32 
none	 points of ice damage reduced to half because of that so it takes 16 points of ice  damage and would be grappled if it wasnt immune to being grappled as the ice encases around it  its fire form flicks out from underneath the ice and keeps itself fluid and moving  orion and i will use two sorcery points to quicken a spell and use my cantrip control flame  to whoosh start juggling the flame that i was caught on fire with  laughter  matt and with that tiberius you gather the fire off of your 
none	 body ill say you are no longer on  fire as your control flame has pulled the fire from your torso and youre now just tossing it  around in the middle of the elemental plane of fire  orion would somebody end this please  matt the elementals turn it turns angrily towards you trying to shoot it constantly with  the ice blast rushes forward whoosh with immediate speed darts up in front of you  attacking twice that is a two so that misses thats a total of eight and 19  taliesin its a what  
none	 matt 19  taliesin its a 19 im going to spend a grit point and say that doesnt hit  matt gunslingers dodge  taliesin yep im going to gunslingers dodge  matt all righty as it swipes out for you you spend your grit point to dodge out of the way  slowmo the giant flaming hand streaks past you what bit of scruff you had on your chin is now  slowly withered away and burned into evaporated air its pretty rough that ends its turn percy  and pike you immediately have your action  taliesin im 
none	 going to unload into its body i know im at a disadvantage because im that close  but im just going to unload into its body  matt so three attacks at disadvantage  taliesin three attacks with disadvantage  marisha was that a 20  taliesin that was a 17 but its okay because i have disadvantage so thats a 21  matt hits second one  taliesin 17  matt hits third one  taliesin 26  orion and liam gunshots  matt so three shots against it  taliesin 18 plus 23 26 35 points of damage 
none	  matt 35 points of damage gunshots as each one blasts through the elemental form shimmers and  you can see now the druid left there in its space lands on its knees looks up at you and gives you  a quick little smile at this point you guys hear roaring flames this rolling crumbling angry  fiery sound as you glance over and you can see the cinderstorm is nearly upon you at this point in  time at this juncture you guys can continue to fight if you want to but you can see cerkonos is  
none	 looking over and looks at the rest of you we should go now  travis and taliesin yes  laura did you complete the mission  marisha i slowly release him down from my water elemental form  matt as he touches down he immediately poof turns into a giant eagle swoops and grabs you  pike gripping sound and heads towards the exit  laura i guess its time to go  orion i think we should go yes  marisha i drop my no im going to keep in my water elemental form  matt okay whats the 
none	 speed on it  marisha 30  matt okay so same speed as you normally would be all right so as you guys begin charging back  in the direction you came from dodging the lava pools as you come the cinderstorm begins rolling  in and you can see its a full like you know that scene in the mad max movie looks like that  and its pouring into the path you guys are running you get about halfway there about ten  minutes into this run before the heat grows so intense that you can feel it 
none	 now burning at the  side of the face  marisha okay i lied i drop my elemental form i go ahead and im going to cast gust of wind ahead  of us to try and make a tunnel and try and air this heat down  matt okay that helps a little bit and gives you guys a little more leeway as youre pushing  forward the storm blows over you entirely and darkness comes in it feels like youre in the  center of a cloud there is light somewhat but your vision is obscured about five 
none	 feet ahead of  you and you think youre heading in the right direction towards the portal you can see roughly  as cerkonos is carrying you through the storm i need everyone to go ahead and make a constitution  check  ashley could i do a mass cure wounds before i go because i was going to do that right last minute  matt you currently are being held aloft and you cant see the rest of your party unfortunately  you can ask him to drop you if you want  liam im reaching out and clasping 
none	 vexs hand as we run forward  marisha what are rolling  taliesin constitution check  ashley all of us  marisha thats not too bad  taliesin okay 21  marisha 22  orion 19  liam ten  laura nine  ashley five  travis 13  marisha aw we were the happy table  laughter  matt you guys keep pushing forward for you guys the sheer amount of heated ash that is starting to  pour into your lungs even though keyleth is keeping a tunnel ahead of you  laura were a little further behind 
none	 her laughs  matt all of you suffer ten points of fire damage  travis can i use my stones endurance  matt you can yes  travis okay shit  ashley im going to ask him to drop me and im going to do a mass cure wounds  matt okay  ashley oh fuck how high am i  matt you dont know  laura and marisha no dont do it pike  ashley hes dying  travis no im okay i got back 19 points  matt okay you shrug off that damage you dont heal past 
none	 it you just shrug off that damage  travis okay good  matt so you take no damage from that  ashley oh thats good  matt so as you guys are racing forward the storm is still blowing and you can hear cerkonos  shouting as a hawk adding this beacon of noise as you guys are trying to follow suit since youre  leading the way keyleth i want you to go ahead and make a survival check  marisha i was going to say can i use my wanderer ability where i think i get my survival 
none	 ability  i think i get advantage  matt ill give you advantage on this survival check go for it  marisha please thats much better okay 14 no dont sorry i rolled a 14 24  matt 24 youre able to keep a focused direction on both where cerkonos is going and keeping a  connection to where that portal was you guys stepped through to get to this elemental plane as  youre pushing forward you find yourself not getting lost in this darkened storm thankfully  slowly ahead of you keyleth you see what looks like the 
none	 slowly rotating portal that you guys  stepped through  marisha were almost there  matt everyone once again make a constitution save  marisha hold on  laura which one  taliesin yes  laura thats good that was better  taliesin 21  marisha 13  orion 14  liam 14  laura 18  ashley eight  travis 19  matt all right everyone below a 15 you take 12 points of fire damage as the fumes come into your  lungs the wind tunnel is helping reduce the dc of the roll to a certain extent 
none	 but this is a very  dangerous storm to be in essentially every minute that passes that youre in it  travis can i use a hit dice to heal myself at all  matt you need a short rest to get there you guys make your way to the outskirts of the portal and  you leap through as one by one you all jump into this portal the druids following behind the  sense of falling becomes this jettison motion as you are shoved and thrown into the air out of the  portal and landing about 15 
none	 feet 20 feet from the fall i need all of you guys to make  an acrobatics check  liam oh you bastard  taliesin can i use my saving throw reroll that i get  matt its a skill check  taliesin its a skill check damn it okay  matt so grog  travis six  laura pike whatd you roll  ashley 16  laura one  liam 25  orion one  marisha 19  taliesin 12  matt all right percy tiberius vax and grog all take three points of damage from the fall  
none	 whack youve hit the ground around this open lava crevasse smacking onto the ground looking  up into the air catching your first gasp of relatively clean air comparatively to where you  just were you hear with a rumbling sound the lava spiral begins to close off sucking sound  ashley mass cure wounds 33  liam what about my sister and tibsy  travis everybody gets 33 points  matt oh you guys managed to catch yourself and dont take any damage as you land on your feet  liam because they rolled a one  matt oh 
none	 you rolled a one  laura me and tiberius rolled ones  matt oh i thought you rolled a one im sorry you take the three damage  laura oh thats it well its easy to get us confused though because we look so similar  matt that is true  ashley 33 guys  taliesin 33  matt as the lava vortex closes you can see the cinderstorm thats been billowing out like a giant  stack of black smoke and burning embers slowly fades away the portal closing off entirely as  the molten rock pool comes to 
none	 rest cerkonos is now standing out covered in soot like the rest of  you and he steps forward and releases his hand out towards keyleth as youre sitting on the  ground from the fall lifts you up to your feet looks you in the eye you you have the blessing  of the pyrah behind you  travis yeah keyleth  taliesin bravo  matt go forth and continue your aramente knowing we acknowledge your wisdom and ability  marisha thank you cerkonos brother  matt he reaches his hand out and clasps it lifts you to your 
none	 feet at this point he turns and nods  to one of the nearby druids the druid steps forward presenting a black orb about that big of  blackened rock that has red veins of pulsing energy arcing through it like a bolt of lightning  locked in a single moment in time this is a spark stone rare within the realm you just  escaped weve harvested but a handful over generations and few have returned with them this  one is yours keyleth to use yourself or bequeath to an ally when crushed by the hands of  
none	 one their fists shall burn with the fury of an efreet  laura for how long  matt for as long as you wish  laura forever  matt the choice is yours who this blessing is given  marisha thank you this is a great honor  matt well youre welcome to stay as long as you wish before you must continue on your journey  marisha i think a rest might be in order im exhausted  travis yeah you think they have graham crackers and little bits of chocolate with marshmallow  marisha oh to make smores 
none	 thats a great idea  ashley thats a good idea  laura and also a lot of water  taliesin water would be lovely  marisha do you have water cerkonos  orion i have water spraying  matt at which point water begins spewing forth from this vial that tiberius has spraying all  this steam is rising up as it hits the ground the heat from the vicinity  orion its mainly for drinking and such but are we all done  matt the other druids step forward looking a little thirsty themselves its a magical source  
none	 of water where they have to toil to bring it to their location they all take out their cups and  fill from it you all drink they take the small cups they have off to the side they cheer to you  eventually leading you out of the cindergrove you guys break your way towards the druidic village on  the outskirts of the forest cerkonos gives a nod rubs his shoulder i am to tend to the wounds of  my helpers in your test do as you see fit leave when you feel comfortable and good luck 
none	  marisha i bow to him and i salute and i say kaitiake brother  matt kaitiake princess and he turns around and steps back towards the forest  travis your people are fucking sweet  laughter  marisha thank you  orion yes i rather enjoyed that environment myself  ashley what does kaitiake mean  marisha it is sort of our salute it means guardian and brethren its a high salute  laura mispronouncing kaitiake  marisha kaitiake  laura kaitiake  liam and not tomorrow please but where do you need to go next for this quest 
none	 of yours  marisha well my last stop would be to the water ashari in aquas back on another continent  travis well thats good i dont think we could take another one right now anyway  marisha no i dont think we could im doing pretty good actually im ahead of schedule  orion laughs wonderful lets just take some respite  travis yeah please  matt well say for the sake of brevity as it is getting rather late and which for all of you guys  watching consider this lengthy episode a gift for the fact that 
town	 we wont be doing this next week  because some of us will be out of town but you rest for a bit you eventually find your way back  down to the base of the mountain range your horses have not been touched although they are a  little hungry an uneventful journey make your way back to vasselheim where over the past six or  seven days of travel pike you come to find the curse has been lifted from the temple of sarenrae  and your followers as they are now calling themselves though you had not 
none	 expected to become  this beacon of light to these worshipers who had no central focus or entity to guide them in their  worship youve become a very important figure to them and they welcome your return to the temple  ashley quietly oh but i dont want to go back  laughter  ashley what if i want to stay  matt then talk to the producers of blindspot  liam youre an important figure to us as well pickles  ashley pickles  travis yeah youve done so much for our lives maybe you continue to do

none	 you soon  ashley oh okay  matt and keyleth you have the boon of the spark stone to gift to whoever or whatever you see fit  marisha do i know what it does can i do like a check on it  matt best you can ascertain looking at it is once the stone is crushed the hands of whatever  creature crushes it become bequeathed with the flame of the elemental plane itself  orion interesting  liam that would be good for anybody  ashley can she use it well she already has that  marisha 
none	 ill keep it safe  matt you can keep tabs on it it doesnt affect a weapon if youre holding it its only physical  attacks like punches claws anything like that are affected by the flame  marisha could be cool for grog boxing  taliesin would it enchant anything in animal form  marisha oh claws you said claws  matt yeah so an animal form of yours trinket anyone like that would have flames on their  forearms  travis maybe well wait until something is negated  liam sleep on it  matt go ahead and
