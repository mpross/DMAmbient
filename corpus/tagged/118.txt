thats it thats /none/ all we have  matt good great  marisha done and done  matt all righty that being the case lets go ahead  travis twins  matt twins  liam twins  matt  and bring it in to tonights episode of critical role  opening credits  matt welcome back so to get you guys up to speed for tonights episode vox machina our band  of adventurers after defeating the chroma conclave destroying thordak and then raishan the  mastermind behind their ascension you then recovered a few objects of possible revealing  her plans at the /none/ very least though keeping it tempered youve begun closing loose ends that you  hadnt had the time to get to at this point including finishing keyleths aramente you  managed to charter a ship and crew at emon to head towards the west the ozmit sea where you were  boarded temporarily by what appeared to be a band of pirates  defeating them and sinking the ship you continued forward taking a prisoner  laura a friendly prisoner were friendly taking a prisoner nicely taking a prisoner  travis what history do you remember  matt you then /none/ eventually found yourselves the ship reaching the outside of the anamn mountains  anamn islands its been a long week  travis yeah man  matt where the ship set anchor on the outside of the reefs that encircle the center of these three  islands where in the center of them lies a partially submerged city of vesrah the last stop  on keyleths aramente and the water ashari that live there you upon arriving just past sunset  watched the city come to life and the vesrah come out and upon discovering that you were allies or  /none/ at least friendly they took you in and gave you the idea of what you had to do to finish this  aramente your task to come the following day was to be led down into the aerie of torrent  where the elemental rift to the water elemental plane resides under protection and you were to  retrieve three lodestones magical stones that are occasionally farmed from the water elemental plane  as they fade from power these stones are utilized apparently in both keeping the rift  contained and keeping the city of vesrah aloft and up towards /none/ the air however in the process of  them researching where these lodestones came from it was discovered in the most recent years that  they were byproducts of one of the krakens that lives in the water elemental plane and  laura kraken plural  matt there are a number of krakens this one however was drawn back to the rift from one of  the earlier expeditions of the waveriders that were attempting to find them and now has taken up  its lair on the outskirts of this rift so your task as vox machina is to /none/ enter the rift into  the water elemental plane find and bring back three of these lodestones and do so without  slaying the kraken as it is an important part of the ecology and continued existence of the city of  vesrah so thats where we come up so as it is evening youve been fed a largely fish and  marinebased meal and youve had the opportunity to speak with some of the locals and prepare and  discuss amongst yourselves exactly what you wish to do for this journey tomorrow so  marisha so what time is /none/ it here  matt i mean its probably postfood and mild celebration of you guys making it here in the  first place they dont get too many intentional travelers most of the people that come here are  either shipwrecked saved by the waveriders in the middle of storms and some of them stay and end up  joining the vesrah they have a number of reformed pirates people that almost died at sea or drowned  but were saved by them and eventually joined them  but id say its about maybe close to 10pm the equivalent  /none/ marisha oh its late  laura i feel like we should  matt you got here just after dusk  laura we should have a heroes feast before tomorrow i have no idea what a kraken does or  marisha me neither actually is uvenda still around  shes still there are we still in front of her  matt uvenda is around yeah you can find her as you approach her shes finished her meal and is  halfnapping in this almost a high chair though its built beautifully of what look to be  petrified bleachwhite shells and /none/ coral structures this looks to be her seat at this open  natural gazebolike eating space shes halfresting off to the side with her staff  leaning off a bit and as you start approaching one eye flies open and rolls in your direction  and she leans forward young keyleth what do you require  marisha sorry i hope im not interrupting  matt my nap yes but you seem intent what do you wish  marisha i was just curious i guess if you had any advice for tomorrow morning  is there anything i should know in /none/ particular  about the kraken  matt from what we know the kraken is a very hungry beast it carries with it a swarm of long  grasping tentacles it moves unimpeded and destroys structures in its path seems  nighunstoppable which is why maintaining the rift is so important to unleash more of these  entities into our plane would be disastrous not just for our city but for the entirety of the  ozmit do be aware that you will be encountering this beast deep deep in the fathomless depths of  the water elemental plane so be /dung/ prepared best you can to swim  marisha right you mentioned it being hungry what does it hunger for  matt anything that crosses its path youll see the sand below the vicinity of the rift is  partially soot dirt and sand but a lot of it is sprinkled bone  of things that failed to make it through the  rift  marisha and i imagine its pretty dark down there  matt its not the brightest place no  laura how large are these lodestones that were looking for  matt we will show you these down /none/ in the aerie tomorrow but theyre roughly and she gives a  motion about that big in her hands about that large but you can take time and research the ones  that are dwindling within the temple that way youll know what to look for  liam and in all your experience with these beasts are their attacks mainly physical  matt mainly however they have a degree of control over the waters that surround them those  who have returned the waverunners who do these passes every few years they speak of currents  swiftly changing it leaving /none/ bursts of darkened inklike material to obstruct the space and they  speak of sudden surges of energy that rock through the nearby waters  laura great  travis so we need snorkels  laura lots and lots of snorkels  liam long ones  marisha are there other creatures that live in the rift  matt there are creatures but those of flesh and bone usually find themselves in the belly of the  beast and due to the nature of its presence and the rifts energy elementals do occasionally  wander halfcrazed directionless in that space as well /none/ so be careful  marisha all right is there a particular creature that you know is good at evading this kraken  matt our waverunners they travel usually in various forms of their merform  marisha all right  matt anything that can swim quickly swiftly search fast and retrieve and return  whatever that is to you thats your choice  marisha okay  laura keyleth i know you have the ability to turn us into different things  marisha yes  laura is it possible to turn us into water elementals  marisha no thats  laura its /none/ not a thing  marisha  thats not really a beast i can turn you into  travis like a great herd of dolphins that we can commandeer  taliesin sea cows  travis yeah and then just ride them  laura and liam manatees  laura narwhals  travis they do have a spike  taliesin the worst of like five worlds  liam the unicorns of the sea  marisha well i know that taryon and i can alter ourselves into merfolk  sam yes  marisha and you can also how many people can you imbue with /none/ your powers  sam to become underwater seabreathers  marisha yeah could you give alter self to others  sam i mean technically i could it would use a lot of my spell abilities but i could give four  of my little coins to people and those coins could be used  to alter yourself to be a waterbreathing  madman like me  laura merfolk  sam well sort of just you but with gills  laura what if we want to be a mermaid though  sam sure yeah you could do that  laura okay sweet /none/  matt with the alter self you can give yourself gills and webbed hands  and you would gain a swim speed of your  normal walking speed  laura and a seashell bra  matt should that be your preference sure as she begins to talk about the  travis for all of us  taliesin oh yeah oh please  marisha definitely  taliesin were all on board  liam this all she talked about from ages six to 13 only thing  marisha sings we are the daughters of trident  travis sings i want to go /none/ where the people are  liam look at our dm  matt anyway  sam i could also think of a spell that would give you a clever rastafarian crab sidekick  laura ooh i like it oh trinket  taliesin turn trinket into a  marisha oh my gosh yeah yeah  taliesin okay okay gotta put the foot  down before this gets weird  laura okay  marisha i agree lets talk about this over a heroes feast hows that  laura yeah but a midnight feast like  taliesin were not doing heros brunch  laura /none/ no cause that would waste a spell on the day  travis keyleth i dont think shes done talking  marisha who what  matt just be warned  marisha sorry we get carried away  matt i would recommend taking some time in the water first learn how it reacts to you and you  react to it know that the limitations of not combating in air can be restrictive  laura makes sense i dont know how my bows going to work underwater  taliesin i dont know how my guns are going to work underwater  marisha /none/ do you have a training ground  like an arena thats kind of comparable  we can test in tonight  matt tonight we could escort you to one of the more deep areas in vesrah if youd like  travis does it have to be tonight  sam well yes if we want to recover all our abilities for tomorrow  marisha were leaving in the morning  travis oh right yeah good point  marisha do we want to practice now and eat later or eat now and practice later  laura practice for an hour have a /none/ midnight feast  travis i hear youre not supposed to fight or kill anything for 30 minutes after you eat  laura right  taliesin at least 30 minutes  marisha yeah  laura so fight first and then snack  marisha so fight first yeah we shouldnt swim after eating  taliesin youll just get a cramp  marisha cramps  liam even thats a pretty big number for you  travis i just say it i dont know what it means 30  matt all right you guys are escorted over four or five structures past the main /none/ eating  thoroughfare into an area that quickly descends the beach drops down into about a ten 15foot  depth you can see this area is almost like a farming ground for bits of kelp and  other sea plants that are just maintained  for food  marisha so were doing this in the morning right were leaving first thing  matt you guys just said you were doing it before  laura no no no no no yes were doing that but were leaving in the morning  marisha no were leaving in the morning though at dawn /none/  matt yeah tomorrow is when you actually venture down to the aerie  sam at dawn we swim  laura yeah  marisha at dawn we swim then im going to go ahead and  cast water breathing on all of us now because it lasts for 24 hours  matt okay so how many targets can you do with that  laura can we still breathe on land  marisha up to ten i believe  sam no laughs  marisha i think its up to ten let me doublecheck im pretty sure its ten  matt oh /none/ dont worry in older editions there were arguments because they didnt specify  laura yeah ooh  liam oh great  taliesin you have to sleep with a glass of water by the bed  laura sleep in a fishbowl  matt all right so between all of you including trinket you guys are able to imbue  for the next 24 hours water breathing  onto the party  marisha ten willing creatures  matt ten willing creatures perfect ah doty does not need it doty does not breathe all  right so you guys you feel this strange /none/ kind of sensation as the air seems to change in your  lungs but still function its a bit colder and as you slowly submerge yourself in the water you  dip underneath and the instinct is to hold your breath for as long as you can its that natural  survival instinct but the moment you give in and allow yourself to inhale you panic for a moment  but then regulate for a moment and feel the water cycle through its cold it chills the  interior of your lungs a bit but you can breathe fine speakings /dung/ still a bit of an issue its  still a kind of a garbled theres no air passing past the vocal cords  travis garbled im peeing im peeing in  the water right now  liam garbled three hours of this  laura can we see under the water hows our perc  travis visibility  laura visibility  matt your visibility is as good as it would be underwater its murky its difficult to get a  very clear view of anything beyond maybe a 20foot span plus this is nighttime its dark  laura what about percy /none/ with his glasses  i mean could we do some sort of goggle things  so we can see better  taliesin we could try to craft some goggles  liam you put em away didnt you  laura so that we could see underwater  liam arent they for close up  taliesin yeah they are for close up but theyre not attached to my water could get in  laura oh  travis do you want me to hold your glasses again for you  matt you would have to ask probably for materials to do that  /none/ taliesin yes  matt you dont have anything to craft goggles  liam you dont want to lose them in the ocean maybe put them away  taliesin yeah ill put them in ive got a pocket  liam just just dont open it  sam crafting goggles would it be helpful to craft something that would allow us to speak or  laura i dont know if theres time for all of that itd be great though  tary youre really good at crafting right  sam i am i would say the best at crafting actually ive spent /none/ my whole life doing it  laura all right could you make something like that in like an hour  sam i have no idea but the adventure is to try right and i certainly will give it a go  taliesin my big question is what am i going to do with my guns  travis go find out  laura yeah im going to try to shoot an arrow and see what happens  marisha yeah go find out thats why were here man  matt okay you pull back and release the arrow and it does fire /none/ but it fires much slower and is  impeded it only gets about half as far and even then with a dull thud  laura does it it doesnt seem like it pierces any  matt it functions but essentially the and this goes for any ranged attacks most ranged attacks i  should say and melee attacks are at disadvantage underwater  travis what  matt and ranged attacks dont go further than their first range increment  laura so what would that be  taliesin im gonna have to look up my first range increment  matt so /none/ if you look at your bow and it says like you know 60 feet 120 feet  you know for first increment second increment  liam yeah  laura uhhuh  matt its disadvantage and anything past that first increment is an automatic miss  it just stops in the water  laura oh no  liam so for example daggers  travis thank you ryan  laura thank you ryan  liam  short distance is 20 feet  matt yeah  liam i could throw it 20 feet at disadvantage  matt and thats as far as itll /none/ go  liam gameplay wise game mechanics  matt also your movement speed is halved  travis son of a bitch  liam this is awesome  taliesin unless we web  laura so for a longbow  matt unless you have webbed fingers or you know use alter self  taliesin or turn into dolphins or  marisha we could be great whites  laura ooh lets be sharks  taliesin swordfish  marisha we could be sharks  laura or we could be merpeople  marisha i can also change us whenever we feel like being something else /none/  taliesin eels electric eels  marisha it just takes a turn rock it like an electric eel  laura how do i find out how far a longbow can shoot  taliesin not that i dont know this isnt going to work but im going to try and see if i can  get even with like maybe an electric pulse if i can light the powder  if the powders wet the powders wet  once i open that thing  matt the minute you submerge your gun the powder is wet  your firearms will not function /none/ underwater  taliesin theyre not going to function underwater  matt im sorry percy  taliesin its okay no id be worried if they did  matt all right so for the longbow your first range increment is 150 feet so youre okay  laura okay  matt but anything beyond that not functional  laura done okay  travis so all melee attacks are at disadvantage because youre swinging through water  matt correct yeah youre going against resistance in the water  travis fucking hate the ocean now  taliesin so theres no way to put a bubble /none/ around me or anything is there  marisha sorry  laura yeah but oh  sam a bubble around what  travis like an airtight bubble  taliesin like some sort of bubble  sam ooh  liam so you think if your bullets were to pierce out through this bubble  they could still go a ways  taliesin or i could even put the tip of the gun out of the bubble  laura wait you can shoot into water  taliesin and fire but as long the combustion has to happen in air  travis yeah yeah /none/ be in a closed airtight space with a firearm  that will do wonders for your ears  sam the firearm  taliesin how do you even know all this  travis oh sorry  sam the firearm has to be enclosed not you  taliesin not me just the firearm  sam but it would only last one shot blow a hole in the side then water would get out  taliesin well if i could have it around just the combustion point  and have the barrel sticking out of the point that might be a thing  /none/ sam that might be something we could try to make i suppose  taliesin out of what  sam we could take apart trinket thats your bear right  taliesin were not taking apart the bear  sam thats your robot bear we could take apart that  laura hes a real bear tary hes a real bear  sam oh well then never mind  laura hm  travis could you make some sort of cavernous hole out of dotys chest  sam we dont touch doty  taliesin okay ive got a crazy idea  travis i mean /none/ ill touch doty but  matt whats your crazy idea  sam we lure the kraken onto land  laura hes still formulating it  taliesin i wanna i wanna build  laura through a portal into  taliesin i wanna build a watertight vest for the guns basically just a packet that keeps that  section dry like a protective like a soft bag that is waterproof that would use some sort of  stomach lining of some animal or some leather to build it i couldnt reload the gun  matt no youd probably only get one shot /none/ each  taliesin one shot or would it just be one shot yeah cause it might  matt cause it would pierce the containment  taliesin well like it would just around everything but the  well the barrel would then have to be  matt the barrel would then fill with water  taliesin thats  marisha tary  taliesin one shot each  sam yes antlers  marisha respect can i imbue one of your mystical coins with one of my spells  that we give to other people or is that  kind of your thing  /none/ sam i mean if you inspected them you would know that they say td on them  theyre sort of personal to me  ive had them minted  marisha oh sure yeah im sorry im farsighted so sorry  sam i dont think that would work its sort of a thing that i can do and im pretty cool at it  marisha i did not mean any offense  sam none taken i respect the question and i respect you wanting to work with someone of my  skill set and aptitude i saw your work back there /dung/ at the last fight and well the gunslinger was  rendered useless and everyone else was fighting on the other boat against lesser allies uh enemies  i mean you and i held off that beast together and it was quite amazing to watch  marisha i mean youre gonna take full credit for it later arent you  sam i made the kill it was 100 mine  marisha all right no thats fine i mean you know  sam but you were there and it was a good assist and i appreciate it  marisha laughs weakly moving /none/ on back to planning  taliesin im going to need some way of defending myself or im going to have to take an animal form  marisha i could give you an animal form  taliesin i may have to have an animal form  travis like what  marisha shark  travis barracuda  taliesin its kind of small isnt it  laura a little yellow fish a little yellow fish thats very friendly  taliesin a very friendly yellow fish i was thinking maybe  some sort of halfoctopus merperson  travis does that exist  marisha ive /none/ gotta give you something kind of real kind of beastly  but it is challenge rating four or lower which is awesome thats cool  travis i have a question for you  matt yes  travis i have two vials of underwater breathing from a long time ago how long do those last  matt let me check actually  travis like an hour  sam i have a question for you as well  matt all right what is your question  sam my rod of mercurial form  matt yes  sam we know that it can /none/ turn into a crossbow  matt one hour  travis one hour  matt yes  sam how many crossbow arrows do i own any  matt yeah you would have 40  sam 40 okay great  matt theyre just regular bolts theyre bolts not arrows  sam thank you  matt youre welcome  travis do we know if the kraken is considered thordaksized or humongous  matt you have no idea but the stories say immense  travis immense  matt yes  taliesin they could take down a ship right  matt yeah from what youve /none/ heard  liam yeah i mean fairy tales tell about them pulling ships  under the water breaking them in half  laura i have a little poison bolt do you want one  ive just been holding onto it if you have a  crossbow  sam yes i would love that thank you how much do i owe you for it  laura 50000 gold  sam it seems like youre just fucking with me  all laugh  taliesin hes catching on  sam lets call it an even five gold  laura hm ill take it /none/ i was just gonna gift it to you but ill take the gold  sam well i dont want there to be any sort of implied favors or anything that i have to return  later if youre all right with it id like to just keep this business thank you  laura i do still want an alter self coin  sam i mean are we doing that i can do four of those alter self coins  travis would that take away the speed halving if we had webbed hands and feet would that  matt yeah youd /none/ then have normal speed through the water  laura see thats pretty great  matt for the record with swimming youre essentially flying too i mean  as far as in water you can swim in an up  and down direction as well  laura thats cool  taliesin when im an animal none of my bonuses  travis right so boots of feral leaping i dont really unless were on the bottom of the ocean  matt its not gonna help you  travis right  marisha you keep your bonuses  taliesin my bonuses stay so my /none/ vestige will actually  marisha yeah i think so yeah yeah yeah yeah  taliesin well find out i suppose  matt if what  taliesin if the vestiges will be functional while im in animal form  marisha wait were still underwater right  garbled underwater speech  laura yeah all of this conversation has been happening underwater  were surfacing and talking and going back under  sam yeah were treading water  matt the targets gear melds into the new form the target cant activate wield  or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment  marisha /none/ with animal shapes  matt yes  marisha so you cant benefit from your equipment  matt right  liam does that negate all my class boosting and all that  matt all that you get in the form of the creature  if you become a creature that has an armor class of 11 you have an armor class of 11  liam what about these merpeople  matt alter self you keep all your stuff and just gain the ability to swim underwater  marisha and its our movement speed which isnt very fast  matt correct but /none/ its better than half your movement speed  marisha correct  matt which is really not very fast so your call  marisha could killer whales give us a movement speed of 60 swim feet  travis were not fucking whales  taliesin im turning into one  marisha he was into sharks but he has something against whales  liam i mean dont knock it  travis whale noises  marisha theyre faster  laura are they  marisha yeah they are  laura yeah but what if the kraken sees it  marisha it says in the book /none/ that they are definitely faster  travis maybe orcas but theyre not whales right  taliesin theyre not actually whales theyre orca  travis theyre like porpoises and shit  taliesin they yeah like with cool tattooing  marisha you guys were down with manatees but have something against killer whales  i feel like our priorities are off  taliesin look we can have different animals like he can shark and i can whale  liam also i know its always been a waste of time our planning but were not even talking  about what were going to /none/ try to do are we going to try to distract this fucker and take his lodes or  marisha i mean if we use pass without a trace right  laura yeah  marisha i mean pass without a trace should still work underwater  if were all something super stealthy we move  super fast get there and get out  laura let me make sure pass without a trace is not concentration  travis important question do we know if the elemental plane is more like the waters off the  cayman islands and its crystal clear for /dung/ hundreds of feet or is it  like more murky boggish louisiana  gulf of mexicotype water  marisha it seems like its marianas trench levels seems like  matt yeah its pretty dark from what youve heard and what theyve talked about the water  elemental plane most of it feels like youre a mile beneath the surface of the ocean  liam oh shit  laura we have to be animals that can grab things  travis light is also important  matt there is a little bit of light that comes through  you do have some /none/ visibility though the source is difficult to really ascertain  marisha heres my thought certain of us are gonna be better under the water with our natural  forms and some of us arent half of us go laughs  sam ooh i like this she is smart  marisha half of us are animals  the other half can ride them in our alter self  forms like a seaworld show  sam yes yes absolutely i volunteer to be a rider or a captain of the ship sort of  taliesin if we throw a little bit of /none/ rope together we can make some quick harnesses  including harnesses that include a little bit of a netting for the stones as we get them  sam a harness around the big man i think that would be quite a formidable steed  travis you back the fuck up right now  sam all right just strategizing chum  travis i understand that  marisha because i can alter self at will and you have to take  a spell slot or can you do it at will  sam i dont know what at will means but im /none/ very impressed  marisha yes  grog thats not a terrible idea cause im gonna be able to  do dick diddly shit in there thats like zero  marisha it means one of us might have to borrow your bag of holding  travis no im out ill stay on the land  marisha tary you had a bag of holding right  sam i do  marisha all right  sam what do we need it for oh to put the  marisha the lodestones in  sam the things in that were finding oh yes yes of /none/ course and they would be great keepsakes  marisha no you cannot keep them  sam oh well if we find an extra one perhaps i could take that back as a  liam question  sam yes  liam im obviously a fan of stealth right but when we go in there and it all fucks up like it  does nine times out of ten and the thing sees us anyway what are we doing  laura run  marisha run  liam without the lodes with the lodes  taliesin well those of us who can swim /none/ quite quickly will try and evade  well try and hide and keep looking for them  laura distract him  liam but we dont wanna hurt this thing so what are we doing  interference and distract and a couple of us try to smash and grab  travis yeah diversion  taliesin diversion scatter grab and run  marisha yeah  laura only attack if truly necessary  sam new guy here  travis bait i like it way to volunteer captain  sam no nope nope new guy here just a process question im new to these /none/ sort of strategy  seshes that you guys have is this how it always is with people  just throwing out random bad ideas constantly for like 15 minutes  liam yeah  taliesin thats about right  liam we do that and then we kind of take it like jazz on the day you know  sam wow because i really this is a big fight for me ive never fought anything quite so big  is there a chance that we might perish  marisha yes  taliesin pretty good  travis no were fine  sam because /none/ it doesnt seem like we have a good plan right now  taliesin well thats the thing about these sorts of encounters is that any plan you have is pretty  much going to be out the window the minute you see it anyway  sam all right  liam if it makes you feel any better this feels less asinine than many things that weve done before  sam that does make me feel better  laura its true half of us are animals half of us are riders  taliesin half more a plan than we normally have /none/  liam i once teleported into the belly of a dragon with another jackass and that went tits up fast  sam that sounds like the stupidest fucking plan ive ever heard  liam im still breathing  travis yeah  taliesin its much like those people who give you instructions of how to survive an encounter with a  tiger its that you think about it but youve never actually met anybody whos said yes ive  met a tiger thats exactly what i did and im fine no anybody who does thats probably been  eaten anyway its /none/ a terrible idea you dont try and look bigger  you dont do any of that youre gonna get eaten  marisha its true  sam ive read some of those  taliesin you survive an encounter by a tiger by running really quickly in the other direction or  hopefully hacking it to death before it kills you  sam all right  liam you know just between you and me this does sound really fucking stupid  marisha tigers arent that bad  taliesin well it was just my suggestion  travis so if four of us are /none/ fast water creatures right something that swims quick  whats our diversion i volunteer as tribute  marisha well if you drop back down to zero hit points youll revert back to your normal form  being able to water breathe full hit points  travis that would be a bad case scenario cause im really slow in that case  marisha yes  travis all sorts of fucked  marisha uhhuh  travis how many hit points does a killer whale have  marisha 90  travis oh god i thought you said nine i nearly shit my pants /none/  marisha 90  taliesin lets see what can we do  marisha i dont know if theres anything else better  laura the thing is the kraken might be able to swallow you whole grog  liam yeah  travis they have mouths  laura i dont know how big they are  travis no they have tentacles  laura no but theyve got dont they have beaks like a squid  travis i didnt hear anything about a beak or a mouth  liam who hasnt seen a drawing of a squid or a kraken in a fairy /none/ tale book theyre disgusting  travis book  taliesin maybe we have one night maybe i could try and craft some sort of concussion explosive  marisha i also dont want you tired tomorrow  taliesin it wouldnt probably hurt it but it would at least maybe shock it give it a  stun it to just blow something up underwater  marisha theres something that i want to try really quick if you guys could back up or maybe  get out of the water i want to see if i can cast spells underwater  laura yeah yeah /none/ im out  taliesin well all right  marisha i also want to see what lightning does so if you dont want to get electrocuted  liam as soon as those two start talking about that i get out of the water and  start attuning the deathwalkers ward to  lightning  matt okay  taliesin very clever  marisha i love that this is all under the assumption that  we just had this planning sesh underwater  laura no we were treading water  marisha oh were treading okay  travis im staying in the water because /none/ i wanna feel the lightning  marisha you wanna see  taliesin you wanna ride the lightning  travis yep  marisha im gonna tread back from grog go underwater  and im gonna do a call lightning bolt see what happens  matt okay call lightning let me check real fast yes okay so you begin to speak  underwater burbling noises spell isnt coalescing  laura oh no  marisha yeah thats what i was curious about thats exactly what i wanted all right then how  about this i take out my spire and i do a /none/ chain lightning out of the spire  matt do chain lightning out of the spire as you concentrate on the staff the lightning arcs out  of the staff and ends up searing and burning a small section of  the floating kelp vines that are wandering up there  marisha okay  matt clears a little area  marisha so i can cast out of the spire and cool  while im under there i want to beast shape into a killer whale  matt okay you turn into a killer whale you are it is about 15 feet /none/ deep so you are  occupying a large portion of the water nearby its really hard to swim in this vicinity  especially with the density of kelp in the center of this dip  marisha i goose grog a little bit from underneath  grog yelps i punch it  all laugh  matt okay roll for an attack  travis i was watching but not that close that scared me im sorry  taliesin its okay its an animal that already has a black eye  travis oh shit  marisha its fine laughs  travis 25  /none/ matt okay so with your strength bonus  marisha laughs uh yeah that definitely hits  matt  you laughs lets see whats your strength bonus  travis eight  matt yeah so you take well say nine points of bludgeoning damage  as grog just smacks you in the nose  liam right in the blubber  taliesin to be fair no worse than anything that happens to a killer whale at seaworld at that point  marisha laughs  travis oh thats terrible  taliesin yeah i went there im so sorry its been there im sorry  /none/ laura is there some sort of alter self spell that  marisha groans oh no  liam change his alignment  marisha oh no  taliesin my personal alignment is already so far down  liam laughs  laura yeah no yeah youre right  matt yeah yeah yeah  marisha i drop form out of shame  all laugh  taliesin sorry  travis were you gonna you were gonna check your speed or something  sam oh  marisha well im in like a tank  laura aw  marisha which is even worse i know this feels /none/ tactless im out  all laugh  taliesin shit got real on critical role  laura i like how seaworld is was what was our line of tactless  taliesin yeah oh no i know what  marisha thats a good point  travis all right jesus christ lets move on  taliesin i know where my money is going at the end of the evening  laura is there an alter self sort of spell that could make you be able to speak underwater is  there anything that you can do that allows for speech  marisha well /none/ if i do alter self  sam did you do alter self just now  marisha let me actually try that i alter self  travis yeah oh no polymorph  marisha to be able to give myself  matt gills right  marisha gills and like fins and stuff and then now can i cast  matt unfortunately because theres still water passing through your throat and vocal cords if  you get a full breath of air you can get one spell off and technically with your breathing  the water underneath because you already had the gills /none/ in it didnt work you get a breath of air  and you cast the spell as the air leaves your lungs  but once you cast the spell the air is gone  sam no more spells  laura what about merpeople how do they talk to each other  sam dolphin noises  laura are there really merpeople there are merpeople  liam frog sacs  taliesin they have a different larynx system  travis dryerase boards  taliesin laughs weterase boards  all laugh  taliesin i deserved what happened below the table last weird question would /none/ it be possible  could i basically just make a bag of air that we could carry that she could breathe in and have to  breathe it in before casting the spell is that nuts  sam well if i may the big fellow over there said that he had some sort of vials that you could  breathe air out of is that true  travis theyre supposed to let you breathe underwater  i dont know if it pumps your guts full of air or anything  sam may i examine it  laura its water breathing /none/ its the spell water breathing  marisha yeah what about my water breathing  sam no its not  marisha  we should still be able to talk  matt water breathing you can breathe the water but when you still  marisha okay but you cant go garbled underwater noises  matt  but you cant yeah its still water passing through the vocal cords  sam what is the thing that you have  matt  which doesnt have the vibration to make the same sound  marisha i think its a potion of waterbreathing  laura what /none/ if we use some sort of  travis underwater breathing  laura  cap right on grogs jug and it just makes air  sam hm  liam not a bad thought  taliesin make a skin  marisha could i speak into the jug clearly  taliesin i was gonna say we could make a diving bell but it would be very hard to travel with  but we could make a micro diving bell  laura laughs  marisha what is a diving bell  travis you guys this is getting dumber and dumber we will have a /none/ movement speed of one  taliesin its basically an upsidedown pot that you stick your head in  and you take a big breath of air but the  problem is moving with it is bad  travis we cant move it  laura okay okay okay  travis itll go straight to the bottom  marisha killer whales  travis yep  laura whales and riders  marisha and all right whos whales whos riders  taliesin whales  travis whale  liam rider  marisha rider  laura i guess ill be a whale or trinket could be /none/ a whale  marisha trinket could be a whale  taliesin or a shark  laura i will ride trinket  travis well it needs to be one of you two  taliesin you might want to go shark for one of them  travis trinket needs to go in the necklace cause of the odd man out  sam please dont leave me behind  marisha i thought you were being a rider  sam i would love to but theres no one to ride  laura cant we have two people on one whale i feel like whales /none/ are very large  sam that makes sense  matt you could muster that yes  marisha yeah  travis okay  taliesin especially if its just handles if its just like hanging onto a piece of rope  marisha all right lets go eat food  matt all right you guys make your way out of the small kelp farming area eventually back to  complete your youre doing a heroes feast  marisha yup  matt okay so mark  laura but like ice cream and donuts like a midnight snack kind of  travis easy psycho  /tavern/ matt that is totally doable  laura like waffles and  marisha hot fudge sundae  laura yes  liam this is the meal i was waiting on  taliesin a heroes sundae bar  laura mmhm  matt the finest of gluttonous sweets available in taldorei are summoned upon this fine mahogany  table that thrusts itself out of the sand everyone in the vicinity steps back and kind of  ooh ahh at this display of unexpected magic other folks step forward to try and take a piece  from it before somebody else stops them with a /none/ hand its not for you you guys spend the next  hour eating your meal and gain the benefits of your heroes feast  all cheer  matt so lets go ahead and  travis oh  taliesin sings zelda music  liam thats extra hit points yeah  laura mmhm  liam how many  marisha 2d10  matt yeah marisha rolls for you guys  liam roll for all of us  marisha  which i will roll for you right now and we both are cocked singsong landed on the  side that one is that still /none/ cocked  taliesin thats cocked  marisha god damn it  travis take some of the dice out of your box  marisha shut up an extra 11  matt all right so 11 extra hit points to all you guys  including trinket who scarfs up happily at  the table  laura yay  taliesin 11 hit points  liam no fear no poison advantage on saves isnt it  marisha wisdom saves  liam wisdom saves  matt wisdom saves  taliesin wisdom saves advantage no fear no poison  marisha no fear no poison 2d10  /none/ laura lovely all right  matt you got it  travis are we supposed to go research the  lodestones before  we go to bed right the ones that are failing  laura oh maybe we could do it in the morning  matt the morning is what you were told  travis okay  matt going to bring you to the the aerie of torrent  taliesin are they heavy or are they light  laura well find out  matt so as you guys are brought to your sleeping quarters which are these semiprivate huts  elevated /dung/ above the water so they are actually about half a foot above the surface you are each  given a small chest a soaked damp chest like the wood itself is just waterlogged through and  through as you open it on the inside each of you receive what looks to be a leather band with a  circular stone affixed to the center of it  laura if this is going to make us be able to fucking talk underwater  marisha oh that will be super frustrating if we just took all that time  or if this /none/ is one of those  taliesin vox machina solving problems that dont need to be solved  marisha solved making problems complicated for five years  travis why dont we put it on and see what it does  marisha yeah  matt okay what do you do theres a cluster of them at various  travis does the leather band attach at either end  matt it has almost like a rudimentary belt clasp on both sides  travis im going to put it around my neck like a dog collar  and im going to lay down in /none/ the water face first  matt okay it warms as it touches the outside of the neck  and it feels like theres a very loose almost a vibration to it  laura gasps talk grog  travis distorted vibrational voice this is really cool  all laugh  taliesin i put my ear in the water to see if i can hear him  matt it does transfer your voice through the water  laura thats awesome what a waste of sings fucking time  travis but but  marisha thats great  matt laughs you didnt go back /none/ to  travis but does it remedy the spell problem  laura yeah  taliesin yes  liam welcome to the cool kids table tary  marisha it does  laura it does  matt yeah it does  sam its amazing  matt you guys can talk under water there is still a limitation  to the distance you travel cause sound is you know  taliesin best of the best  matt actually no sorry the sound does travel further  taliesin it does  matt underwater conduit  laura oh so we have to be super quiet /none/  matt however you also look within the case and each of them has what looks to be spherical  somewhat seethrough domes of some glasslike material  laura gasps  matt you are also affixed with goggles and you remember looking back you saw some of the people  who were part of the troupe here especially the guardians on the outside of the city had the same  similar goggle sets hanging around their neck  liam get the fuck out  laura this is awesome  taliesin hello waterbased culture would you happen to have some goggles /none/ lying around we could  borrow maybe something thats to communicate underwater i dont know  liam makes ding noises to mimic hitting glass dome  marisha we totally didnt  matt nobody asked but they were provided  marisha we should have asked what equipment was available  all laugh  matt these are standard given to the waveriders the guardians that look on the outskirts of vesrah  laura what a fucking idiot  marisha i feel stupid  liam gong noise  matt laughs  travis tary jumbo  laura we dont have giant domes on our /none/ heads  liam i do  all laugh  travis i just thought of one thing for you right i went fishing this one time  matt just goggles  travis  and the lure that i had was really shiny and sparkly like fish love sparkly things  in the water and im just noticing now that you are really shiny and sparkly kind of all over  laura oh  sam like a lure  travis yeah  taliesin i was actually just contemplating that because you know how frustrated  you get opening up a crab when /none/ youre  going to eat it  travis i lost you at like the third word  taliesin i wonder would it be ironic if the kraken gets frustrated trying to peel off the  armor itd just be a wonderful irony im so sorry sir  liam i mean thats funny but it doesnt sound safe  taliesin no  travis what if we paint you in like black paint or poo  marisha oh yeah and that will immediately go away  laura oh yeah thats smart  marisha as we go underwater  laura oh  travis /none/ all right paint it is or tar  laura alter self  travis should we tar him  marisha if you alter self right  taliesin i dont know lets  marisha can you make yourself darkish  laura maybe you should be a whale  taliesin just not reflective  sam i dont like any of this when i was treading water before was it difficult in armor was it  matt yeah  all laugh  sam and if i were to remove my armor would i be weak and squishy  travis you already are  matt /none/ yes  all laugh  matt thats a valid point  taliesin thats a very fair point  matt you have a breastplate right  sam uhhuh  matt actually its heavy but its not super impeding you its heavy but from a mechanical  standpoint it doesnt make it more difficult for you to swim  its just more of a heavy breathing yeah  sam but its shiny  matt it is shiny your armor is shiny  travis what if we put you like in a potato sack  so youve still got your armor but it /none/ just  doesnt twinkle  liam thats not a bad idea at all  taliesin he is not wrong and thats not a bad idea  laura is there any burlap around  sam i have a robe i have a robe  marisha oh okay  sam i can just wrap myself in my robe  liam its not just as flashy as the armor though is it  sam it has some colorful patches on it yes but theyre not shiny  laura what if i stitch up the front  travis no no potato sack  laura /dung/ i just would hate for it to open up im just gonna do you mind if i just  marisha well if its dark  sam stitch up the front of my robe  laura im really good at sewing  travis better not be flashy  sam all right i would yes thank you  laura yeah i stitch up the front  matt okay  sam thank you  laura itll be like a choir robe for you  liam good idea grog  laura yeah that was smart  sam thank you so much  travis thanks /none/ i go fishing a lot  sam you lot are taking good care of me i appreciate that  thank you this is going to be fun  right tomorrow  laura fun fun fun  taliesin fun  sam yes  liam scary fun  taliesin scary fun  sam all right  marisha so much fun  taliesin technically speaking we cant quite feel fear at the moment can we  or is it just a general malaise of fear  all laugh  marisha yeah i like i like the latter malaise of fear  laura i /none/ start working on the robe  matt all right  laura really ugly stitches  matt yeah its i mean it takes you a while to get through the whole robe and get it done and  its functional more than visually appealing but you get the job done  sam this reminds me of one of my caretakers when i was younger stitching up some of my play  clothes its a nice feeling thank you so much  laura youre welcome darling  marisha while theyre winding down can i sneak away and see if i can find /none/ uvenda  matt sure its not too difficult shes in the same seat snoring loudly while two of her  guardians stand at the side with their thin polearmlike blades  just watching as you approach and shes just like snores  marisha i turn to her guards and say do i wake her up does she not like being i dont want to  be rude but i kinda need to talk to her and im only here for a few more hours and i  matt one of them takes his bladed trident and hits her  just /none/ gently on the side with the butt of it she goes snorts awake  marisha ah thats how you do it  matt ugh yes young keyleth hm  marisha hi  matt she leans forward putting on the presentation but you can hear just that slight  undertone of frustration what can i do for you  marisha uh yeah i was just curious im so sorry first off  matt keep talking please what do you want  all laugh  marisha you mentioned that there were only remnants of my mother that came back was she  /none/ defeated by the kraken or do you think this was from another means  do you have any more information on her  matt child there was little left of her and her allies we found other pieces of her friends but  pieces her leg was all we found we could not recover much else but the sea floor is littered  with the many corpses and pieces of the krakens various prey  it does not take much to ascertain the nature of her end  marisha and youre sure of this this is what the kraken does /none/ to people  matt what it does to anything that crosses its path it eats to survive  marisha hm i was just wondering if there was any other potential explanation or  matt im sure there is there are many potential possibilities for anything that happens i only  have the information i was able to glean from the various scouts and teams  marisha how long ago was this  matt this was four five years back  marisha really all right thats not that long really did she stay long  matt a few days prepared for /none/ the journey much like you did that was the last we saw of them  marisha all right i was just curious thank you  matt i wish i had different news for you  marisha did you keep anything from what you found  matt her head turns curiously i fear i did not  marisha okay  matt we gave a quiet burial to what we were able to recover but thats all  marisha well i appreciate that much thank you for doing that  matt of course and once again i am sorry for your loss /none/ keyleth  marisha oh its part of the duty  matt yes yes it is  marisha well i should be getting my rest  matt yes you should  marisha yeah big day swimming lots of calories im gonna go now  matt yes  marisha all right bye  matt yes you will goodbye  marisha goodnight  matt snores just conks right out again anything

marisha yeah  liam okay  marisha a lot yeah a lot riding on this but a little surreal that were here  liam long time coming  marisha yeah  liam you know you are already a river to your people  marisha what  liam /none/ i know that your life has built up to this moment in many respects but your father is very  proud of you youve already done a lot you silenced that dragon youve done a lot  marisha im just glad i have you all  liam you know i know that you struggle with doubt and i dont think its ever gonna go away  for any of us especially for you i think thats part of the job youre getting ready for but i  dont see it as a weakness you know all this time ive remembered /none/ uriel  im not big on monarchies and the like  but i liked him  marisha he was a good man  liam yeah may his soul rest and he had doubts and he let them inform his decisions and tried to  do what was right and the questions you have i think they speak to your character  marisha uriel was also blinded by his unknowance of a lot of problems  so i just hope i dont follow in his footsteps  in that regard  liam well all the matters is what we leave behind /none/ us when we go youve already done a lot of  good and youve taught me to be happy again im very grateful to you so thank you  marisha thank you for believing in me  liam you make that easy  marisha anyway we should get some sleep its a big day tomorrow  liam yeah you know i noticed about a week ago you were curious about my wings i shoot them out  marisha heehee hee i pet them a little  liam we have one hour fade to feathers  laura gasps  all laugh /none/  laura beatboxing  sam skyfuck  laura oh shit  travis i just want vax and keyleth to do the original superman  movie dialogue while he and lois are flying  marisha oh god that weird poetry  all laugh  laura oh yeah  travis can you hear my thoughts  matt just like slow narration of keyleth disembodied  as theyre both just flying over vesrah at night  taliesin i have a thing just for you  marisha is he god  travis can you read my mind  all laugh  matt perfect  /none/ liam i dont think they went anywhere  matt thats perfect  taliesin just for you pass that down later  matt all righty so anyone else doing anything else  taliesin im collecting some seashells and taking a bit of a walk  matt okay  liam derp  taliesin and eventually were chilling  laura yeah  matt okay  laura im gonna brush trinket  matt disgruntled bear noises  laura you need it youre dirty  all laugh  matt more disgruntled bear noises its various knots and seawater clusters  laura yeah just gross  /none/ matt its just not fun all right so morning comes to the sun rises its a warm day but the  waters are crystalline and beautiful as soon as you step out and since you havent been here  during the daytime you can see its a paradiselike existence the sands that fall  beneath the waves are white just bright bleached white and the entire city seems like the middle  of this distant tropical paradise the islands that do kind of flank in a triangular position as  the islands of anamn they are just lush and green /none/ and dense you see no signs of civilization built  across them they are just unending canopies that swarm these masses of land that break past the  oceans surface in the distance but here in vesrah the city cluster its beautiful the  water has almost a turquoisetype shimmer when you see the areas that are deeper and you see in  various sections where the sand drifts away the sandbank vanishes into the reef and there you can  see just an array of colors that refract beneath the waters surface  as a gentle breeze kind of /none/ blows through  in sections  liam i want to go to there  matt its beautiful  laura i want to spend the morning before anyone else gets up standing on the edge of the water  and like letting my toes sink deeper and deeper as the waves  liam thats nice  matt okay you guys eventually gather your way for a morning meal and you can see in the  distance now some of the waverunners are doing perimeters and you can see that they have large  sails that are up on these triangularlike pointed /none/ boards that curve up into hornlike javelins in  the front and they are coasting on them basically surfing across the waves in the  distance doing runs around the perimeter of the reef  laura thats fucking sick  marisha thats so cool  liam cool  matt and they are wearing the same goggles and the same throat pieces you were given  laura ah  matt this is part of the standard equipment that is given to  the waveriders as they check on the outside and the vicinity of vesrah  liam that one looks like /none/ keanu reeves and that one looks like patrick swayze  all laugh  sam keanu reeves as johnny utah impression hes not coming back  matt its a clear sky not a cloud visible beautiful blue above you what do you do to prepare  liam oh jesus  marisha oh i find uvenda  matt okay shes actually already waiting for you as you guys  shes been up earlier than you were and  marisha i take some time in my morning prep to do a little meditation and i take my flame hands and  i do /none/ some like traditional ashari war paint kinda thing going on  travis sick  laura nice  marisha yeah  matt nice okay  marisha yeah oh yeah  taliesin are we bringing the bear  laura yeah  taliesin were bringing the bear  laura trinkets gonna be a whale  marisha mmhm  taliesin all right  liam hopefully the whole time  marisha as long as he doesnt hit zero hit points then he wont turn into a bear  but he has water breathing  laura if he hits zero okay i have a question  /none/ matt yes  laura if he hits zero hit points  marisha as a whale  laura does he go into the  matt no  sam trinketform  matt the form reverts  laura would revert and then  matt becomes trinket at full hit points carrying over any damage that happens and remember only  trinkets or any of your natural form maintains the bonus hit points from your heroes feast  your animal form does not  laura okay  matt so you just have the base hit points of whatever creature form you take and once /none/ you go  to zero and revert back to yourself or just revert back to yourself  then you have your hit points plus the  heroes feast  liam and gameplay mechanics can trinket get walloped so hard that it passes  all of his new form plus trinket form  and take him out  matt if it was a shitton of damage yeah  laura it would have to be 150 points of damage thereabouts 160  taliesin is it possible to grab a spare set of goggles and choker just in case  matt asking around /none/  taliesin well return them all  matt  you approach uvenda to ask this question even as you approach theyre looking out in the  distance she says yes that could be certainly mustered  and she snaps her little gnomish fingers  taliesin thank you  matt and one of the guards wanders off comes back a few moments later and retrieves an extra  pair of goggles and the throat bead  taliesin excellent  matt and its called a throat bead  all throat bead  sam how many of us need my coins to become /none/ altered  travis i need to be a whale  marisha thats me  taliesin three  liam so riders show of hands rider rider  laura i mean i can just use water breathing and cast pass without a trace on us  thats the only thing is i cant do that if i  have alter self  sam oh well then i can just  marisha well if you cast pass without a trace its a concentration spell  sam you wont be able to swim very fast though  laura if what  sam she cant /none/ use alter self and pass without a trace  marisha is alter self a concentration spell  sam yes  marisha oh i could cast pass without a trace though  laura okay  marisha i did bring it today  laura oh good all right  marisha i could yeah wait  travis are there

matt about this time as youve seen uvendas been looking out patiently the water nearby at  the very edge of one of the reef dropoffs splashes out and you watch as a figure darts out  and lands and shakes off and what you see there looks to be a very very darkskinned stocky  dwarf /none/ wearing the same goggles and throat bead there sorry about the delay he wanders up and  pulls his goggles off and rustles his hair a bit hello so youre the ones traveling to the aerie  today waverider durent pleasure to meet you and he reaches over and grabs as he takes your  hand you put it out to extend it he grasps it and gives a firm shake  you see hes got very very short dirtyblonde  hair  marisha durent  sam yeah  matt and a beard that is just tattered and knotted from /none/ not being kept or combed through  marisha so someone you would find at venice beach  matt kind of yeah hes the venice beach dwarf basically  laura gasps thats awesome  matt straightup actually now that you point it out  liam just finished going up the ropes and down  matt all right im taking you down to the aerie you ready  laura i think so  taliesin sure  marisha are you gonna be with us the whole time or are you

lodestones before we go through the door  travis right yeah knew it making sure you knew  marisha theres doors to the other planes thats our peoples job  matt its a figure of speech  sam were going to another plane  all yes  sam oh my okay this is great this is great  matt oh you look really excited  sam i am  matt you /none/ shouldnt be now come on see youve got your equipment and takes his goggles and  puts them back on theyre bulbous theyre just these giant domes that make you look flylike  taliesin i love it  liam nice  matt okay now follow suit he looks over thank you uvenda  of course take care of them  thats not my job and dives into the water  marisha i go in first  sam wait dont you have to make some of us  marisha oh right  laura no no no wait how long does it /none/ last  travis right at the fucking start  marisha are we doing this now  laura no cause we can do it underwater cant we  marisha animal shapes last for 24 hours  laura well lets wait until were going into the water plane before we turn into fucking whales  travis dont we have to examine shit first with our nonflipper hands  marisha yeah hes gonna be showing us the stones first right so yeah jesus i go in first  matt all right so you guys follow suit diving in diving in each one of /none/ you in the order you  wish eventually with doty splash just sinking very heavily down after you  laura hes coming  sam oh no  laura tary shouldnt we leave him  sam how deep is this  marisha i cant nope hes a construct  matt do you prefer doty not to  sam i would prefer doty not come he cant swim right  matt no he can just walk across the bottom  travis were not going to tell you what to do here  matt your call  sam im a little confused were /none/ going underwater now  but not to where were going for the mission  matt correct  marisha the portal to the other dimension is underwater and through a rift  travis imagine endless water  laura just lots of water  travis no possible bottomless  sam all right then doty can come this far  liam to the rift  sam just to the door  travis we barely knew him bring him along  liam wait by the gate like a butler  sam yes  travis that was quick  laura what if he gets rusty /none/  sam i hadnt thought of that  laura it might be smart to not have him join us  taliesin the rusty dotys another knot that you know  laura just leave him behind  sam the rusty doty  all laugh  matt whats your plan yes or no  sam doty you should stay behind  matt goes to jump like  sam stay behind and just take atmospheric notes you know time of day position of sun type of  clouds and if anyone tries to steal my stuff describe them very well in the book /none/  matt a little seagull flies overhead  all laugh  sam its all for color for the book you know  matt another one just taking very very good notes  sam two chapters of seagull flight patterns  marisha youre gonna have an excellent book on the mating habits of seagulls when you get back  matt eat your heart out darwin dotys on the case  travis oh my god  liam love you matt  matt its ridiculous so you guys all eventually dive into the water and as you do you look down  and /none/ there is essentially a 40footwide gap in the beach here just barely submerged beach that  coasts down and drops off directly down into this cylindrical section that is just open and as you  drift down your goggles visible you can see around you dry pale reef that slowly gives way  to colorful lifeteeming reef you see hundreds of fish of different sizes and colors all darting  in and out of the various gaps and openings in the side you see vibrant plant life beginning to  massively jut out from the side of this reef further /none/ down you see eels twisting through and  bits of kelp and other long underwater plant life tickle your body as you push past and drift  keeping track of where youre slowly sinking down desperately trying to follow this dwarf that is no  longer in view he just dove straight down and is far more comfortable under the water than most of  you eventually the reef begins to cluster in tighter and tighter and you start getting a  little nervous as to if youre going to hit a bottom or hit a pinch point and then /dung/ suddenly it  stops the reef just ends and you now are floating down into what appears to be endless dark  ocean and just below you see just a faint bit of light and you start noticing the dark color is  because youre about to hit an extremely dense forest of underwater plant life you watch as all  of these long thin tendrils of almost vines covered in elongated leaves begin to curl up  around you and you start pushing through following this light and as you get across to the  edge keyleth youre the /none/ closest ahead and you guys have just enough light to watch the bead of  where keyleth is keyleth you can still see durent and keep that pace he leads you down over  this bank of where the top of this underwater forest ends and you see attached to the reef  above by a single pillar of stonework that seems to be built or carved out of the reef emerges a  spiraling tower that eventually ends on the floor of the ocean here its made of a yellowishwhite  sandstonelike color there are pillars carved out of /none/ it naturalistic but also have almost a series  of bevelled edges to them within the inside there is a dull green glow that is pulsating and  as durent makes his way down toward one of the many openings in the floors you can see there is  a very very faint sparkling energy that seems to just drift up out of the center of this tower as  you make it further down towards the base you now begin to see through some of the openings the  center of this tower is hollow it is an exterior /none/ like a very thin colosseumlike structure that  goes up for multiple floors slowly pincering as it gets to the top and it is just an open  interior inside as eventually you touch down onto the soft bottom of the ocean here and begin making  your way slowly swimming towards the interior you can see a number of other similarly dressed  waveriders as well as armored guardians that stand all with various trident or spearlike  weapons a number of them appear to be of varying races human halfelf elf it appears that  durent is the /dung/ only dwarf you see in this vicinity and a couple of them appear to be merfolk like  straightup halfhuman halffish tails fins gills the whole circumstance  laura what does their hair look like  matt laughs you see two of them one of which is male no visible hair on him actually just  the frill that goes down his head the other is female long deep dark blue hair that drifts  past and as she shifts and looks in your direction  you watch it hold in place and slowly shift as the water currents push /none/ through  laura i just stare at her  matt laughs as youre entranced by this your attention slowly glides over to the very center  the base of this temple where you can see there are these three large smooth grayish rocks that  are embedded in the ground about five feet wide and in the center of these three rocks you see  what appears to be its almost like an oval shape about ten feet tall about five feet wide  that is crackling blue energy this opening here and you can watch as occasionally clouds of /none/ black  murky soot or sand deep deep ocean sand push through you can see as you get closer and peer  in this is a doorway into the plane this is the rift unlike the one that you saw at pyrah which  seemed to flicker and have a barely contained energy when youve seen it at its tornopen  stages this appears to be fairly contained its demure theres not a lot of movement its just  stationary and the guards that surround it in the center of this temple all look inward keeping  vigilant watch as /none/ you follow durent making his way towards the doorway you can see within each  of these three large halfburied stones there is a smaller deep emerald green almost jadelooking  stone that is about that large that is embedded in each of these durent points over to one of them and  you hear him through the water the throat bead carrying the sound of his voice through this is  what youre looking for this is a lodestone take your time as much as you need to study it find  what you need let me know when /dung/ youre ready to pass through  laura are they all the same color every lodestone looks the same  matt yeah you glance through theyre all the same color slight variations and the shapes  change a little bit some are perfectly spherical some are a little oblong  just whatever shape it eventually hardened into  taliesin kind of a natural jade  matt kind of yeah but like a dark dark jade like maori new zealand jade  laura not translucent at all not  matt no  laura okay  marisha keyleth goes up and touches one /none/ and meditates on it for a second  matt okay as you put your hand towards it you feel a very very faint vibration  actually a very similar vibration to the throat  bead  marisha really are the throat beads green do they look similar  matt at this point now you notice yes theyre made of the same material you see that a lot of  the lodestones main purpose is here but a lot of the inherent magic of them or at least the  enchantment properties of it its a pretty big part of the /none/ general life here at vesrah  marisha do the beads tend to react when they get closer to the lodestone  matt there is no change but you do feel that faint hum  and vibration of power of the lodestone that is embedded within  marisha i turn to durent whereabouts do they tend to be found the lodestones  matt well i mean all over  marisha all over  matt who knows where theyve been dropped the ocean tends to swallow things up  you might have to dig mostly we find them  buried  marisha /none/ buried  taliesin how heavy are they  matt let me show you and he goes over and grabs one and strains and pulls it out the doorway  flickers ever so slightly hes like its fine for a moment and hands it to you you take it  and for its size it is surprisingly dense it has about twice the weight you were expecting and  your arms just grunts a little bit also as youre holding it you notice the clasp on your  cloak is being pulled towards it as you pull it away and pull /none/ towards it  you realize these are actually fairly magnetic  taliesin theyre magnetic  matt yes  marisha magnetic percy do you have a compass  taliesin i dont but i can fake one pretty quickly if we have to  marisha really you dont have a compass really  taliesin we never needed a compass  travis what do we even have you here for i mean  taliesin is it possible well were too deep now but  matt as youre having this conversation you watch as durents patiently there  taliesin you have a compass dont /none/ you and im going to hand it back to him  matt no but i need the stone puts it back inside okay were good  sam if i examine it do i detect any magic on it  matt you do profoundly magical this is a very very strong natural magic source  taliesin this is going to be weird im going to take out a chunk of whitestone residuum and just  compare the color and see if theres any relation  matt make an intelligence check  taliesin look at my sheet thats a natural 20  /none/ all cheer  travis the snitch returns  matt interestingly enough there are similarities it is not the same material but  youve had enough time to study whitestone and get a feel that there are this is your first  inclination that there are more than one substance that seems to be related to the nature of magic  this is at least based on the ecology and what little bit of history youve picked up from the  kraken and how long its been around whitestone may be one of  the more recent sources of this type /none/ of power or variation on this type of power  but there are certain comparable facets of  its ability yeah  taliesin it actually occurs to me that i might have some magnets on my person can i make an  investigation check i had quietly in my head been using them to  keep my coat down when i was running around with the spider boots  liam the magic of improv  taliesin i wouldnt say it if it wasnt true  matt no thats fine  taliesin can i make a roll to see if i /none/ happen to have some on me  matt id say you have them on you youre percy its fine theyre very simple magnets  taliesin yeah they might help with im going to try and see  if i can use them as a very base dowsing rod for these stones  matt you notice that you dont any sort of pull you feel on the magnet  doesnt seem to hit until youre within about a foot or so of the stone  taliesin okay  laura i do have locate object  sam i pull out my compass /none/ and see if it works  matt okay you pull out your compass  travis you have a compass  sam sure yeah i have a compass by the way  marisha really you have a compass  matt as you pull it out you watch as you stand there its confused its darting around and  doing circles as you begin to step in one direction towards one of the stones  it rights itself in its direction  sam hm fascinating  laura nice  marisha will you keep that handy you know  sam oh sorry yes /none/ one second just still pressurizing  marisha sure  travis equalizing  taliesin in my head you have zinc all over your nose theres just zinc  marisha and a hula shirt  sam oh yes do you want a  taliesin yes were really pale people this is probably a good idea no  marisha i tap it because ive seen other people do that  and i feel like thats what you do with compasses  travis and it shatters  matt shattering sound  marisha ahh  matt yeah it seems to be a functional compass  /none/ marisha do you want to be the compass man are you gonna man the compass be navigation  sam the leader absolutely  taliesin the navigator yes  sam the navigator sure  marisha the navigator  sam sure  matt all right  travis any other tests you brainy types want to do on these giant green balls  taliesin i feel comfortable we have locate object we have a compass  laura yes locate object is concentration and so is pass without a trace  marisha so when we get through the void and maybe we can do /none/ a locate object and then pass  without a trace and then ill cast animal shapes and then we go  matt locate object by the way  liam that is a lot of steps  laura its within 1000 feet  matt yes  laura yes  marisha but it lasts for ten minutes  matt it does yes  laura yes  matt okay so you guys ready  marisha yeah  sam yes  liam eh  matt all right  travis

exterior portal into the /dung/ floor you step out at about two feet below  the doorway your feet two dull thuds slowly hit the soft cushy bottom of the water elemental  plane you see about you a number of thick clusters of various underwater plant life rising  up and slowly shifting with the waves and the water you also see throughout the dark sand in  the vicinity hundreds of bones and various other chunks of flesh in various long states of decay  it is dark down here you maybe have about 20 to 30 feet of visual range right here /none/ unaided our  two humans friends over there have almost no sight beyond a five tenfoot distance here usually  from just the glow of your armor your helm itself has this radiant glow about it  liam im using divine sense right now to see if anything is not completely  matt okay youre youre divining for what  liam undead in the bones  marisha ooh  matt okay as you carefully close your eyes and focus you lend your essence out to the raven  queen even across the planes to guide your vision to anything of /none/ undeath  or fiendish in nature and nothing  laura im going to take a moment to use primal awareness and see  is there a way to sense krakens or anything  matt i dont know do you know how to sense krakens  laura i dont know do i  travis do you sense calamari  liam dm snark  matt looking at your various choices  laura aberrations celestials dragons elementals fey fiends and undead  liam and krakens it says right there  laura and krakens  matt okay as  laura krakens  matt as /none/ you focus your attention utilizing and mark off your ability there  laura yes  matt you sense nothing you said elementals are on there  laura elementals aberrations  liam aberrations  laura  and fiends  matt which one are you choosing  laura oh i have to choose one  taliesin aberrations  marisha elemental  laura what do you think  travis i think you should just get all of them  laura what do you think aberrations or what do you think a kraken is  sam aberration its an animal  marisha youll definitely /none/ find elementals because theyre definitely here  laura what would a kraken be  travis an animal  liam if its not an aberration  taliesin an animal  liam itd be a beast which you dont have  travis a mineral  all laugh  liam the only thing on there  marisha a mineral laughs  liam the only thing on there that it is maybe is an aberration  laura aberration  liam i mean elementals  taliesin theyre not really aberrations  sam theyre aliens  laura no  liam theres nothing on this list  /none/ laura all right then im going to try for elementals  matt okay you sit down and focus and dozens of nearby signatures hit you youre not quite sure  what direction they come from but you know that this area is teeming with elemental energy  it has drawn many elemental powers nearby  laura theyre like everywhere  liam theyre all around us man  sam its impossible its from inside the room  marisha theyre in the walls theyre in the goddamn walls  travis this is really important i fart do the bubbles go up  /none/ matt bubbling noise they do  travis were in a safe place  taliesin that was weirdly helpful  marisha do i see that  matt you do  marisha thats actually insanely helpful  taliesin thats really genuinely helpful  all laugh  taliesin looking at  sam garbled voice should we use our flashlights  taliesin garbled voice why are you doing this with your face  marisha garbled voice no  travis i dont know i dont know  sam garbled voice i dont know it felt  travis looking up can you see any sort of /dung/ surface to the water like you would if you were  150 200 feet scubadiving down and  matt i mean your vision in the vicinity is dark and you feel like youre at the bottom of a very  very deep abyssal ocean looking up you see a faint turquoise glow in the upward direction but  it seems sourceless almost as opposed to straight up it almost encompasses a full dome  and you see no sign of a break in the water  travis thats what i thought  matt  and the various strands of plant /none/ life extend far into the darkness and strange kind of  fuzzy distance where they fade out  travis we in it  laura i have a feeling light will attract all sorts of creatures down here  travis yes  taliesin im not entirely sure the creatures down here have eyes  laura hm  marisha most do have blindsight or echolocation so they  laura hm what about those kind of fish that have the  marisha might not be good for us  travis yep  laura  things that dangle in front of their faces  /none/ marisha angler fish yeah  travis movement light shiny things all bad  marisha mmhm  liam tarys armor  laura hes covered  sam thank you  marisha do we have a few minutes i can do a quick locate object spell  see if were headed in the right direction if  you wanna  laura im going to use a locate object spell  marisha can i assist her in any way  matt nope this is her particular spell to cast  marisha all right  taliesin im going to examine the sand and just gently /none/ dig around to see whats around  this is fascinating im just digging for  whatever  matt okay your feet hit and pull apart and as soon as you do you get about four inches of the  soft sand before you start hitting black dirt  that immediately starts to cloud and obscure your vicinity  so you carefully stop for a second  taliesin good to know  marisha wow  sam im going to load up my flashlight with one of those daylight gems  but with the lens fully closed so no light can  /none/ escape  matt okay so you go ahead and you activate so mark off another one of your opals  sam sure  taliesin theres a red filter  matt as you activate it as soon as you close the device and you feel it contained within  sam okay  taliesin you do have a red filter  matt all right you cast locate object laura  laura yes  matt all right so as vex you focus concentrating  on the lodestone that you saw before  travis through the portal behind you  laura no no no /none/ it finds similar objects  travis i know i know i know  matt lets see you feel the direction pull you this way  laura awesome  matt you dont know how far away but the distance pulls you in that direction  laura there is a lodestone within a thousand feet that direction  marisha you know taryon just gave me an idea  sam i tend to have that effect on people  marisha thank you for your infinite wisdom taryon we might be able to use a daylight spell  as a distraction worst case scenario /none/ because i can place it somewhere and then leave it  laura oh that is smart  marisha yeah  taliesin if we have to use an opal we can  sam sure  taliesin so we can be far away when we activate it  travis how far away can you place that  laura she can cast it on an object and leave it behind  marisha i can leave it as a distraction  travis right  laura you could  taliesin lets not cast it near the portal though  marisha i dont wanna do it /none/ right now but im just throwing it out there  laura  cast it on the tip of an arrow and i can shoot it at least 150 feet  marisha thats a hundred percent true weve done that before  taliesin very good  marisha just keep that in mind all right yeah all right  taliesin filing it away  marisha okay we have a direction are we ready  laura lets try to move stealthily for a little while  or should i just drop it and cast pass without a trace right now  taliesin

lemon  travis do we see anything swimming above us or around us  matt looking in your vicinity you see clusters of ruins you see broken pieces of very very old  stonework and looking at them they are scattered throughout the vicinity singular chunks of  structures lets see percival go ahead and make an intelligence check  taliesin thatll do 20  matt okay looking to the left of you as you pass by this one structure you can see the chunk of  wall thats visible it /none/ is thick enough and tall enough where it looks like its a sliver of the  base of a larger structure that was designed for far larger creatures the sense of the erosion and  the relatively smooth edges of the various broken parts to it tell you  that its been there for a very long time  taliesin this was for a larger creature like giants  matt giants or larger its hard to really tell this is not a humansized  taliesin did these ruins crumble or did they sink  matt they appear to have crumbled /none/ the structure in which theyre placed  has intentional placement within here  taliesin and is the stone does the stone feel natural or does it feel like stone that would be  underwater does it look like the parts of it that have been underwater are doing well or does it  look like its eroding as something that shouldve been above the surface  matt it looks like theyre eroding as expected for something thats been there for a very long time  taliesin and theres no writing visible  matt no no theyre almost extremely smooth just /none/ been there for so long and hit with various  blasts of water current sand dust and other things for such a long  period of time that its smoothed the  entirety of the wall structure  taliesin okay  matt all right you maintain the locate object  laura mmhm  matt as you guys push forward eventually it leads you this way until you begin to feel the  direction change this path there so you lead the path over this way  and it leads you to the edge of this wall  sam do you /none/ need some help finding it  laura can i look around does it seem like its right there  matt make a perception check  laura okay 25  matt glancing about the vicinity looking over it all you look at the wall its smooth theres no  indentation theres no sign of a stone looking at the sand  on the ground at the base of it no sign of a stone  laura can i move some of the sand out of the way on the ground and see if i see anything  matt make an investigation /none/ check  taliesin compass  sam compass yeah  laura ten yeah bust out that compass  matt yeah you begin to pull apart some of the sand  and the black murkiness begins to come up underneath and you dont see anything  marisha i stand watch while they do this and just look for any movement  matt perception check  sam is the compass moving  marisha dont fuck me gil  matt the compass is currently focused on the same direction that youre moving towards the wall  liam im going to join keyleth as well /dung/  sam im gonna cast detect magic  marisha 25 no 27 sorry  matt okay nice you glance this way as youre looking overhead you can see a dark very large  dark shape right about here looks to be the shelf of some sort of an underwater stone cliff or a  mountain of some kind that leads up here like a bank at the very top you see very faint  movement looks like individual long tendrils of some kind  just barely visible at the outside of your  dark vision  marisha i come over /none/ the intercom and say be very quiet very still very slow  sam i dont hear that so i just cast detect magic  marisha oh son of a fuck you dont motherfucker  matt okay so you cast detect magic you currently in front of you dont see any sort of  magical source nothing seems to glow or emanate at the wall or near the base of the wall  sam within 30 feet  matt right  sam even under three feet of sand  matt let me doublecheck something here for you  laura im gonna /none/ wander to the other side of the wall and see if its on the other side  taliesin im with you  sam one foot of stone one inch of metal  matt okay you faint you still feel the direction of the magic where youre looking but  you dont see anything on or around the base of the wall do you move around  laura to the other side of the wall yeah  percy yeah were moving there  sam ill come with  matt as you and percy find yourself at the other side of the /dung/ wall there  marisha still keeping an eye on the dark figure  matt the direction of the locate object leads you adjacent and just beyond the wall  on the other side of where you guys were looking  laura ah that makes sense do i see it now  matt you do not see anything  taliesin im going to gently pat at the base of the wall  matt okay both of you guys make investigation checks please  taliesin not disturbing anything investigation 13  laura highpitched nine  matt youre both digging through and pulling /none/ at the sand  and dig further and it causes the black  laura were digging softly were trying not to do that  taliesin very gently  sam im coming too i want to  taliesin if anything were sucking at this  sam and im going to cast detect magic again  matt focusing you do feel a very very faint magical essence from the sand about two feet to  the left of where theyre currently sifting through the sand  laura shh shh shh  taliesin shh  sam oh okay jesus im just trying to /none/ help us

before clunk you feel one of your fingers  hit a hard surface and you begin to  pull underneath  laura i think we found one  matt you pull and begin clearing the space around it and it takes you a minute or so with the help  of both taryon and percival but you dig enough of /none/ this sand and soot from underneath to get around  and you have there currently in your presence one of your lodestones  laura do you think theyll know if we grab it do you think its going to attract anything  taliesin i think we put it in the bag of holding and it wont matter  laura grog  marisha ill watch

laugh  matt well on that /none/ note okay so you focus as she draws the arrow and pulls with intent in the  back of the bow as you do you focus and you watch as vex you aim and then close your eyes as  you see this spark of energy curl off the front of the arrow you see bright naturebased daylight  burst out of the arrow as you release it go ahead and  make an attack against the kraken with  disadvantage please  laura okay  marisha come on  laura come on  laura and marisha come on  /none/ laura come on come on  matt no you were right if you choose a point with an object youre holding and

laura deep voice 12 plus normal voice one lightning damage  matt all right so 13  laura this is not a sneak attack and i obviously cant have done hunters mark  matt right so the arrow /dung/ sinks into the underside of the krakens dark form youre just barely  making out bits of its shape as the light hits you can see now close to it looks like ten  various tentacles curling and finding its way over the top of this structure  it slams into the side and daylight brightly sprays out from under it  laura i want it to be by its eye  matt by the way because daylight no it lasts for an hour so you watch as this light is now  billowing from underneath the creature you can /none/ watch as its pupil adjusts to the light it does  not appear to be blinded or have any issue with the daylight however it is now a beacon and the  arrow now partially jammed into its side you have a very clear idea and a bright view of the  battlefield around it as this kraken is now emitting light in its vicinity  marisha sure  laura well now theres shadows  travis and a giant megalodon comes and eats it  all laugh  laura ooh thatd be great  matt so thats your first attack /none/  laura oh yeah i cant do a

matt you watch as the spark of energy from the arrow hits it the second time the daylight  obstructing your view and the energy bursts around it the lightning damage youre used to  seeing from any creature it impacts the lightning seems to just hit its blubbery hide and vanish  laura right cause lightning it just did lightning obviously its immune to /none/ lightning  right and im gonna use my motion to back the fuck off and try to get behind that rock  outcropping laser pointer okay yeah sure just on the other side of it  matt thats as far as you can get  laura okay cool  matt because you

keyleth pointed  and try to see a lump or something in the sand  matt okay make an investigation check  liam okay i made a hold on 18  matt 18 18 okay you just get to this part of the sand and you /none/ start sifting through and its  causing this cloud and you hear the water just being rapidly whipped through and cut behind you  from the rapidly moving tentacles as you pull through you just begin with your action to  uncover what looks to be the very peeking top of the final lodestone  liam is that one action because i have an action and a bonus action  so ill just do as much as i

marisha okay five six seven eight nine plus four which is 13  plus another six which is 16 19 and  a six which is 25  travis 25  matt 25 was what you needed to force it to make a constitution saving throw  travis 25 exactly wow  laura wow  matt well based on the /none/ circumstances i halved the damage required for it to make the saving  throw to regurgitate however a fireball explosion based on the  marisha three four five six seven eight im sorry you said 8d6  matt yes  marisha its actually 29 points  matt all right so  marisha please dont kill this thing  matt no as the fireball explodes

front of the krakens mouth  taliesin what are the chances it dropped any of us while this happened  matt nothing  taliesin nothing  sam yeah  marisha but grog and i are out  liam but everyone on the

teeny ones or little ones  taliesin no it would be a normal or like a swimming creature  though whats the speed of a swimming creature  matt make your choice keyleth  marisha okay okay okay  matt most snakes are 30foot swim speed  marisha most are and hunter sharks are 40foot swim speed killer whales are 60foot swim speed  laura so make us killer whales  marisha but theyre bigger motherfuckers so

die  taliesin yeah no matter what you do  marisha dont kill the kraken  taliesin kraken aint dying  sam i mean  taliesin kraken got ten thousand hit points  sam wow  taliesin hes not even vaguely dying  sam is there a part of the kraken i can see that looks like i can  do damage /none/ to it without hurting the main  what is that the thorax laughs  matt you dont see any it is a big creature your friends are somewhere deep inside its fleshy  digesting interior the outside is armored and filled with very very taut muscle and hide so  yeah you would probably not damage your friends if you were careful  sam all right well then i will take off a diamond and blast it with a prismatic spray  laura gasps  matt oh shit  taliesin thank god  sam yeah yeah except half of the /none/ things wont do anything to it  taliesin yeah but we are out of options  laura well still better than nothing  taliesin i am totally okay with a hail mary  laura oh my god  matt okay so as a prismatic spray in this direction out this way itll just crest past  the front of the kraken and the tentacles lets see here  prismatic spray thats a dexterity saving throw on that  sam im sure it makes it  matt that is a 23  sam yeah of course it makes it  matt /none/ all right so roll for your first beam which is against the kraken itself  sam do i roll a d8 or wait to choose what kind of beam  matt are you focusing on the kraken or one of its tentacles  sam i mean no tentacles are holding anything right now right  matt currently no  sam all right so  matt so itd be just the kraken  sam just the kraken  matt all right so roll a d8 to see which beam hits it  sam five  matt five that is 10d6 cold /none/ damage  sam oh cold thats good  matt so go ahead and roll that  taliesin want some d6s or are you

sam groans  travis disable those tentacles man  matt thats 13 all right  taliesin if you do enough damage to it it may vomit them out  travis no we gotta /none/ do it from the inside  matt you get that sense  laura groans  matt all right  taliesin do you have yeah and the tentacles dont get a prismatic spray of their own  matt nah its one of those things where it just damages the creature  you have to focus a specific physical attack  on one tentacle  taliesin oh man  matt all right that brings us to the top of the round vax  go ahead and roll a death saving throw with advantage  sam i cant do a rip off a /none/ patch and take a potion can i as a bonus  matt a regular potion you mean  sam its a patch potion  matt a patch potion  sam yeah  liam its like a nicotine patch  laura would it be

sword at the ready  taliesin if it gets close enough just sword just  matt okay  laura 28  matt 28 hits roll damage  laura 12  sam that shark is our most effective weapon  laura the shark has been pretty great  matt all righty that brings us to  sam what can you turn us into  matt  the krakens turn top of the turn the acid burns through you even further /none/ vax  you fail another death saving throw  liam so thats two  matt thats two all right top of the krakens turn its going to lets see whos in range here  sam sings with the background music  travis this is mindblowing  laura and its so

going to make a tentacle attack at /none/ both  at the shark vex and keyleth  laura but he only has two tentacles left  matt thats right two tentacles so its going to make one at vex and keyleth  travis but the shark is so dangerous  laura the sharks been hurting it  sam the shark is literally the most dangerous thing we have  laura and keyleth just is barely  matt you gather this creature is far more intelligent than you think  its not a natural beast its a fairly  intelligent creature  sam what if the shark gets the /none/ how do you want to do this  matt that is a 26 versus you you take well the good news is im rolling shit damage that is  18 points of bludgeoning damage to you vex and you are grappled by one tentacle and against  keyleth you are its technically not within five feet of you thats a natural one i was  like im pretty sure he had advantage because youre prone but prone is the creature has  advantage against any creature that is within five feet of the creature  otherwise it has disadvantage so /none/ yeah  laura thats great  taliesin oh god  marisha ill just go back to doggy paddling  matt thats one thing that saved you and thats gonna be just the two attacks thats all it can  do this turn all right that brings us to grog youre up  travis let us whoop the everloving shit out of the inside of this kraken reckless everything  yeah just all three
