dung	 being the case lets go ahead and pull ourselves in this evening to  tonights episode of critical role  dramatic music  matt hello and welcome back goddamn it sighs welcome back ill remember that your dungeon  master will remember this  so last we left off vox machina in trying to find a way to seal off the growing threat of  vecna now restored to physical form and seeking ascension and achieving it youve gone to a  number of the deities across the exandria pantheon of the prime gods gaining some blessings and  gaining 
none	 bits of essence from these deities to create something called a prime trammel an item  that was used previously during the calamity to seal one of the betrayer gods and could possibly  put an end to vecnas newly ascended form and reign as the only god on the prime material plane  across the divine gate  information given to you by the knowing mistress sent you beneath an underwater volcano known as  scaldseat where you proceeded to learn how to breathe water and then step into toxic fumefilled  tunnels where you proceeded to breathe through 
none	 the water via grogs jug very clever but  finding your way through a short battle with some of the indigenous life forms there a mother and  two children magma bulettes you headed down deeper into the volcanic caverns of scaldseat  eventually finding a longsealed series of chambers by the allhammer the deity for craft  family and legacy where somewhere supposedly beneath this volcano and hopefully within these  longsealed chambers lies the core anvil where these prime trammels can be constructed  as you made your way through here hearing the undulating reverberating pounding of some 
none	 distant  piece of machinery it seemed heading down the stairs you were put into a hexagonal chamber which  had a square of coals and above that x bars against the wall where in the center you saw a  gold inlaid seal almost whats the word im looking for an empty triangular shape a pyramid  inverted within this golden seal and a series of these iron warriors that were embedded in the  walls behind the stairway you saw and you identified upon seeing it means of smelting metal  and other forms of material when percival 
none	 was inspecting one of these warriors it immediately  came to life and you watched as the glowing outline of each one of these tenfoottall  12foottall metallic warriors glowed bright orange they each emerged from the walls with  these large twohanded greatswords at their side and immediately began to incite conflict  and thats where we left off so to begin this fray where are you guys placed currently  percival you would probably be right about where that guy emerged  taliesin i would probably be about there  laura you were on the wall  taliesin 
none	 i had my boots on so i was up by his face  matt okay so well put you there oh god here you go grog was by the smelter  laura i feel like i had been looking at the thing the big empty pyramid triangle thing  matt so youd be over in this area  marisha i feel like i was with vex maybe on the other side yeah  laura i was on my broom because i had been hovering looking at it  matt fair enough so youd probably be about  laura about there 
none	 then  liam i know that i had just poofed the wings out and i think i was inspecting one of the big metal men  before it came out of the wall i dont really remember which  matt most likely one of the ones that was not attended by another member of the party so well  say about here and scanlan whereabouts were you  sam you know near things cant really see too well so put me where lets see i was at the  door when we opened it and then i was beautiful and 
none	 now im not as beautiful so put me near the  door  matt near the door so well put you over in this one here  taliesin so all of their faces are indented  matt yeah each one of them as opposed to the other warriors you saw in the chambers that led  down into this area have no faces instead where you see are an empty void triangular like the  large seal but vacuous  travis but matches the same shape  liam they didnt manefaces around im misremembering that maybe i just really like 
none	  manefaces  matt which is a good thing but regardless i would like you all to roll initiative  laura not so soon grumbling  travis is their head height about the same height as the seal and the crossbeams  matt the seal is a little bit higher than where their heads are all right so 25 to 20  laura 23  travis 17  matt 20 to 15  taliesin 16  matt all right so we have grog 15 to ten  sam 12  liam oh sorry i was looking at a book 18 
none	 sorry  matt all righty keyleth whatd you get  marisha five i dont want to talk about it  matt well that being the case as these large metallic warriors are emerging from the sides of the  chamber wrenching the large metal blades these large rectangular almost slablike swords bladed  on each side vex youre up first what are you doing  laura oh god  marisha what do we do  taliesin what do you do hot shot  laura i want to attack them im going to attack the one next to percy attackstyle im 
none	 going to  hunters mark him and then im going to attack him im going to do this and then this and then  this  travis what are things like this considered creatures or golems  matt constructs  laura god dang it that was a miss it was a one it was a natural one  matt all right yeah so you do actually pull back the arrow and it strikes true however the  armored plating is so strong that the arrow shatters across the front of its armored chest  laura fuck i do it again 
none	  matt all right second shot  laura oh my god 21  matt 21 hits  laura okay well thats good oh my god im going to scream yeah i know bro youre not  bro youre hubby  travis she called me bro game of thrones is obviously back on the air  laura 14 dont say other numbers 14 plus seven is 21 24  matt 24 points of damage all righty and are you going to stay wherever you are or do you want  to move  laura how high is the ceiling  matt 
none	 the ceiling is about 30 feet up  laura yeah im going to fly up  matt 25 to 30 feet  laura all right im going to go to the roof  matt okay youre going to go all the way up to the roof  laura oh yeah some of that was lightning damage that was two points of lightning damage because  theyre made of metal i dont know if that did anything special  matt okay thank you for the headsup on that all righty so ending your turn that brings us to vax  liam 
none	 all right to start am i within striking range of him if i back up a little bit  matt if you back up a little bit  liam yeah do i need to disengage  matt you are currently engaged with him  liam okay so that im that close  matt yeah you were inspecting it as he emerged  liam okay im going to use my bonus action to hunters mark him  matt all righty  liam and then im going to stick him in the face is what im going to do  laura oh 
none	 wait i get 3d6 of sneak attack now  matt if you havent been marking that yeah you should do that  laura an extra four  liam so thats 30 for the first and for the second 30 for both  matt 30 for both hits  liam yeah because im at advantage because im going before them  matt correct so both hit  liam all right so the first one which will get the sneak attack fun is ten plus psychic damage  is 16 plus sneak attack damage counting 38 for the first plus hunters mark 
none	  matt plus another d6  liam 44 for the first and for the second is one thats it is one plus the hunters mark again  right  laura only hunters mark once on your attack  liam so its only for one attack because i dont use it all the time  laura just kidding its hunters mark every time  liam every time  laura yeah no i know that  liam so five for the second  laura yeah sneak attacks only once but hunters mark is every time  matt yeah whenever you hit it 
none	 with a weapon all right so whats that second one you said  liam just five  matt five all right got it  liam wait thats not true sorry 11 because its not an offhand attack its my second paladin  attack  matt thats correct there you go 11 boom all righty and youre going to stay put or youre  going to move somewhere  liam im going to risk an attack while im not hasted im going to risk an attack and back up  about ten and go up another 15  matt okay  
none	 travis yeah they cant throw those greatswords right  laura dont give him ideas stop it  marisha you cant be paralyzed or restrained  travis helps a lot  matt all righty so youre also just about at the ceiling with her as you shoot up and away it  strikes up quickly after your daggers have been carving into its armor its blade comes up in a  wide arc against you that is an 18 plus 12 30  liam 18 plus 12 just barely hits  matt all righty  laura wow do we still have 
none	 our death ward on  matt you do yeah  taliesin oh yeah thank you for reminding me  marisha and our heroes feast  taliesin were pretty metal  matt 32 points of slashing damage as the blade rakes across the front of your chest and forces  you back even further your shoulders end up slamming into the ceiling from the impact of both  you retracting back and the blow itself your wings have to catch you for a second and youre  keeping yourself elevated at the moment finishing your turn there that brings us to 
none	 grog  travis right standing by the blacksmithing stuff i say you are interrupting grogs arts and  crafts and i would like to rage  matt all right into a rage you go  travis and i would like to charge at that little bastard right there  matt this one here on its own  travis yes please  matt up into his face you go  travis up into your face  laura get him grog  travis reckless regular strike not terrible 29  matt that hits roll damage  laura 29 is not terrible did 
none	 you know that  travis hey thats good 28  matt damage all right  travis the second one reckless great weapon master  matt okay  travis just because thats a million thats 34 minus five is 29  matt 34 minus five nice that hits  travis five nine 21 31 31 points of damage  matt 31 points of damage fantastic  travis and that ends my turn  matt all righty ending grogs turn there percival  taliesin im going to cry out to everyone we need their heads dont hit them in the face please 
none	  i am engaged i know theres nothing i can do i am engaged with that thing arent i  matt currently yes  laura maybe he doesnt see you because youre above him  matt you technically triggered it its seemingly aware of your presence in fact the moment you  say that you watch as the metallic head goes creak and looks up right to you that creepy  triangular void staring right at you  marisha do you think you can dispel their magic  taliesin i dont know im going to try and take a run 
none	 in the other direction i know its going to  take a swing at me yep im running down the wall  matt this way to the corner  taliesin yep as far as i can go  matt thats about as far as you can get on that wall  taliesin ill start coming that way too not a full its six spaces so  matt so at that point youll be about there all righty it does swing at you  travis youll be fine  matt 19  taliesin 19 just hits  matt 19s your ac 
none	  taliesin acs 18  liam escher man is down i love being able to see everything  laura i know  matt 34 points of slashing damage which almost cleaves you off the wall  taliesin 34 points okay so hold on let me do the math on that counting okay yeah im at  151 because i had a whole bunch of temporary points  matt as youre running along the wall it hits you from behind and for a second you feel the urge  to black out and you fight through it and keep running you 
none	 can feel the warm spreading on the  back of your shoulder blades from the blow and you careen around that corner and stop spinning  to survey the room what are you doing  taliesin i pull up im going to take my first shot im going to take a straight shot and im  going to blow a point of grit well get to that and im going to try to get him to drop his sword  first thing is im going to try and get him to drop the sword thats a 34 to hit  
none	 matt that hits  taliesin strength save against a 20  matt okay that is a 13  taliesin drop your sword  matt its sword clangs to the ground as you fire you see one of its fingers is bent back and busted  from the impact and it looks over for a second you watch as its broken finger clicks snaps back  into place and it looks back at you  taliesin okay so that was shot number one oh boy here we go ive also got to do damage on  that which is im so 
none	 sorry where are all my dice there we are oh i didnt do that so none  of that where are we going im going to drop three points of cabal into this as well oh  there we are six points of psychic damage four points of lightning damage and 16 points of  standard piercing damage  matt got you and which weapons this  taliesin animus  matt got it perfect all right so boom the finger curls back and breaks into place  taliesin next thing im going to do im going to cast hex on 
none	 him give him disadvantage on strength  saving throws  matt well strength ability checks  taliesin strength ability checks and im going to take a sharpshooter shot thats 20  matt 20 just barely hits  taliesin okay good to know making that note so im going to drop three more points of cabal into  that so thats 20 points of piercing damage four points of psychic damage 13 points of lightning  damage and three points of necrotic damage  liam percys turned into rambo  matt okay so the second one you watch as one of 
none	 its armored shoulder plates dents inward from the  impact and theres a small pierced hole in the center where it seems to have blasted through its  armor  taliesin and last shot im going to try and push him ten feet back  matt okay  taliesin natural 20  cheering  taliesin should have done damage theres no damage on a push shot  matt yeah  liam but he got pushed  taliesin but he got pushed ten feet back and hey i get a grit point back  travis yeah man when we got pushed 
none	 in the playground that got in your head  taliesin so hes got to move ten feet before he can pick up his sword  matt correct  taliesin and thats everything  matt all righty that ends your turn all right it is now their turn so the one that you just  blasted back as it skids to a halt almost slams against the wall it looks over at you across the  way and then looks around and surveys the room quickly with its strange triangular vapid  lackofaface glances up and sees vexahlia on the broom 
none	 above goes into a full leap to push  with its feet off the wall and attempt to grab towards you in the middle of the air  laura oh no it can jump that high  travis like a wwe cage match  matt its half the size of the room practically in height  travis this could be real bad we might get totalpartied right here  matt so im making this a grapple check so roll either acrobatics or athletics  travis whichever ones better acrobatics  laura 25  matt no 34  groaning  matt 
none	 i rolled really high so as it leaps in the air and grabs you it drags you off the broom and  then basically slamdunks you into the coals crash straight over prone into the coals  landing at the side of them right there the broom goes clattering off to the side its still  chained to you from the apparatus that you placed and it scatters across the stonework a couple of  feet from you  travis i thought it was just going to slam you into the ground  taliesin oh its going to hurt  
none	 matt you suffer 19 points of bludgeoning damage from the impact  taliesin remember you have the temporary hit points  matt and then ten points of fire damage from being slammed into the coals you are considered  on fire you need to take an action to put it out or you take 1d10 damage every turn  travis singing you whip your hair back and forth screams  matt however its sword and ill go ahead and use this as a marker the sword is on the ground  right there so it cant use that right now 
none	 the other two can so this one over there that got  shot by you and flew away as it arcs up its starting to look around to see if it can gain any real  intent to go towards you and then glances off to the side and instead sees the smaller targets the  softer easiertogetto druid and gnome  liam what a fool  marisha bring it bitch  matt turns to engage both of you  travis this is the coal pit  matt its going to stop partway through there and its going to go 
none	 right up there you watch as  underneath the head the armor part in the chest suddenly hinges open and you see this bright  burning furnace in the center of its chest that boom lets out this extremely whitehot burning  angry torrent of flame  sam can i cast cutting words or can i use cutting words  matt you can if youd like  sam i dont know if its going to do anything but sure  matt it can reduce damage because cutting words can reduce damage on an attack  sam only by a little 
none	 i want him to miss right  matt well its going to hit regardless you guys have to make saving throws  marisha its a cone its just going to hit us  matt it would be about there get all of you including the other guy  laura if im prone do i still get to roll to roll through the coals to avoid it or some shit  liam yeah hide yourself under the coals  travis laughter yeah like the mcdonalds ball pit  matt you do not get disadvantage on saving throws so you can still 
none	 continue to roll i need  scanlan and keyleth and vex to all make dexterity saving throws please  marisha theres a hypodermic needle in here  travis oh god yeah  taliesin how very santa monica  marisha sorry keep hitting the mic just dex saving throws  marisha and taliesin groaning  sam wait are you pointing to me oh i have this dice its the first time ive ever used it it  has poop on it someone sent me poop dice and i think i just rolled a natural 20 because i rolled  the poop 
none	  matt whats on the other side of the poop  sam the other side is a skull  travis so thats a one right  laura i think for you you count the poop as a 20  sam is poop 20 or is poop one  laura i think poop is normally one  matt whats next to the poop what other numbers are near it  sam 19 13 and seven  matt no thats a one two ones on that  laura you got a one as well  marisha no i rolled a three so 
none	 im at seven  matt yeah so keyleth and scanlan you both from the chest furnace take 38 point of fire damage as  it burns out in front of it you take half that  laura okay which is what  matt its 19 points of fire damage to you and the flames burn across the other armored  individual the giant construct and you watch as some of its damaged form begins to seal up from  the flames  laura flames help it fire heals them cold damage do cold damage  travis fire bad  taliesin 
none	 fire good  travis is good  marisha you said minus 38 right  matt so thats going to end its turn the chest slams shut now and the flames retract back inside  and you watch it exhaust smoke out each sides of its armor and the flames that you saw burning in  there are now dimmed but beginning to flare up again the one thats by you grog is going to go  ahead and move adjacently its head spins around for a second to look up at you and then it spins  back to you 
none	 its going to make two strikes at you with its greatsword it has advantage on you  because you used reckless  travis yes it does  matt all right that is 31  travis that hits  matt that is 30  travis 30 points of damage  matt no thats two attacks  travis oh yeah they both hit of course  matt okay so for these 33 points of slashing damage reduced to half  travis what is that  matt so thats 16 right yeah  laura 31 divided by two yeah  matt well its 
none	 33 divided by two and then the other one is another 34  travis damn  matt so there you go round down so 16 points of slashing damage so thats going to end its turn  there all right bringing us to scanlan your turn  laura do something amazing  sam im on vacation so nothings going to be amazing is the sword still on the ground  matt it is  sam is it near me  matt its about 25 feet from you  sam okay i will cast bigbys hand and i will pick up 
none	 the sword and i will use it to hit not the  guy whose sword it was but the guy closest to me  matt okay  laura theyre technically both equidistant from you  sam okay doesnt matter i want the guy who hit me  matt okay so you can move bigbys hand ill see how many feet it can move because itll pick up  the sword i dont know if it can  sam it can move 60 feet  matt it can move 60 feet okay then then yes it definitely can it darts over 
none	 to the guy who hit  you with the flames so go ahead and make your attack ill say for the purposes of this ill  add an additional d12 slashing damage to its strike  sam i got an 18 plus something i dont know  matt 18 to roll for its attack plus your spell attack so that definitely hits  sam oh plus 11 yeah thats huge is this a sword attack or is this bigbys hands clenched  fist attack  matt im making it a clenched fist attack so its 4d8 force damage from adding 
none	 an additional  d12 slashing because its wielding a sword while it does it because thats cool  sam thats cool okay i love you and thank you so i roll 4d8 cool oh wait wrong one  matt 4d8 plus 1d12  sam 4d8 17 plus 12 29  laura well plus a 1d12  matt plus you have to roll a d12  sam oh sorry thank you then its 17 plus seven  matt okay 24 points of damage to him all right perfect so the fist comes by and slams into it  the sword arcs 
none	 through its armor and you watch some of the plates separate a bit but its still  holding itself in place thats your action  sam oh i get a bonus i will inspire keyleth i guess not that she needs any help shes so  fricking powerful but i will inspire keyleth by singing singing your minxie brings all the boys  to the yard and theyre like its better than yours damn right its better than yours you can  teach them but youd have to chorge speaking i dont know  matt take a d12 chorge die 
none	 all right and do you want to move at all  sam im close to a guy whos going to hit me if i move right  matt youre not currently in melee with a guy yet but youre on the outside of melee with two  guys  sam then i will move dead center on the board  matt all right so youre going to move back up the stairs a bit then youll be here that ends your  turn scanlan keyleth youre up  marisha do you need help off the coals  laura ill figure 
none	 it out  marisha youre fine right okay i am going to turn and do a tidal wave against this guy in front  of me so he has to make a dexterity saving throw tidal wave  matt pull this up real fast  travis away the guy behind you or the one across the pit  taliesin the one closest to us or the one on the other side  marisha let me see counting i dont think i can hit both of them with most of my stuff  laura can you hit the two that are 
none	 by us  marisha i can but i think itd also hit you its a straight line  laura how much damage is it  marisha 4d8 bludgeoning  laura put me out i wouldnt be on fire anymore  matt you can do it in a way that would probably hit both of them but it would probably hit her  as well  laura do it  marisha are we concerned about me extinguishing these coals we can light coals again right  laura unless theyre magic  travis i have made fire  marisha okay cool then 
none	 with permission from vex ill put you out and then ill step out of  the way  laura maybe itll push me out of the coals  travis its going to turn this room into a sauna  marisha yes im turning into a sauna im going to hit that and go boom  matt all right so it slams across them all right dexterity saving throw for vex and both of  them  liam this combat just got a lot sexier  matt laughs 18 and a nine  marisha fail both of them  laura oh 
none	 do i roll a dexterity save too  matt you do  laura i think i fail it oh no 16 fail  matt knocked prone knocked prone okay yeah so you take the full damage as well but you are no  longer on fire  laura yay did i get pushed out of the coals from the water  matt no but the coals are no longer burning so its not a huge deal at least that edge of it  isnt  marisha so they take 19 damage theyre knocked prone and the water extinguishes all unprotected 
none	  flames  matt so as this giant column of flame roars up you watch as one of the constructs disappears into  the water and gets slammed into the wall sloshing over the coals temporarily douses you  flames go out but you get battered around briefly by the other guy behind you both of your forms  crash into each other he falls onto his back and as the water subsides steam fills the room now  visibility is now limited  marisha like a fog cloud  matt yeah everybody in here for the most part unless 
none	 youre directly in melee range youre at  partial cover  laura is it up through all the way to the ceiling  matt yeah it only lasts a round or so then itll dissipate but for the next round or so  theres partial cover for anybody not directly in melee  marisha partial cover so it works both ways  matt yeah against them and you  travis as if vax needed any other reason to hide  marisha i can feel the chat saying thanks keyleth i can feel it  laura you know what seriously though 
none	 thanks keyleth  matt are you going to stay where you are  marisha yeah  matt all right that ends your turn were at the top vex youre up  marisha no wait im going to take my bonus action to go water elemental and then i can still  move right can i then move my water elemental into this guys space and as part of my elemental  form i can move into spaces that are within an inch  matt yeah thatll do  marisha can i enter a hostile creatures space  matt yeah perfect 
none	 all righty that ends your turn vex now its your turn  laura okay so im going to stand up  matt you get up groans the flames are gone youre still aching from being slammed so heavily  into the coals there and you can look down you can see beneath the water that has turned to steam  and is dissipating on the middle of the hot metal floors of this room the construct is still  thrashing and about to get its way back up what are you doing  laura i can see him good enough 
none	 though to shoot him  matt oh yeah hes right there  laura am i at disadvantage because hes prone but hes right there  matt youre at disadvantage both because prone and you guys are in melee you can back up if you  want to to try i mean unfortunately because hes on the ground and its a ranged weapon its still  disadvantage its nothing to do with the weapon its the fact that hes on the ground prone  taliesin oh its on the ground okay  laura okay well im going to back up because 
none	 he cant take a strike at me right  matt he can take a swing at you but itll be his fists  laura im going to back towards the stairs where scanlan is  matt so youre back up towards the stairway there it does get one swing at you no he already  got no because your turn is before his so he does have his reaction so he swings out with a  fist at you that is a 21  sam i will cutting words that  matt okay  laura thanks scanlan  matt well 
none	 what are your cutting words to him  sam oh im going to quote from some old tv show and say you are a monstrous mechanised misguided  moron thats it  matt very nice go ahead and roll a d12  travis i dont know that tv show  taliesin i think its lost in space  sam correct taliesin jaffe oh shit i only rolled a three  laura does that cutting words him down to 19 or 18  matt yeah that brings him down to an 18  laura then he doesnt hit me  matt 
none	 as the fist swings wide the words seem to strangely cut through to what element of an ego  this charismaone creature has and slams into the metal causing this large heavy knuckle punch to  the ground as it resounds with this heavy clang that shakes the ground vex you manage to move by  without issue  laura great i think im going to then try to attack him  matt go for it two attacks with disadvantage  laura okay ugh natural 20 was one of them 30 is the first attack  travis its 20 and 
none	 an 18 thats pretty good  matt actually its an interesting point the prone an attack roll against the creature has  advantage if the attacker is within five feet of the creature  laura oh so if i hadnt moved away i would have been okay  matt possibly its still ranged youd be at disadvantage for ranged in melee so would have  been a regular attack  laura yeah so its not cancelled out if i hadnt moved it would have been never mind well  just fucking say its fine because then im going to wish 
none	 i had that crit i just got so 30 was the  attack roll okay groans okay that is 13 14 15 15 plus one lightning damage plus six sneak  no sneak attack just kidding  travis did you hunters mark him  laura theres the hunters mark five hunters mark thats the first attack and the second  attack at disadvantage is 19  matt 19 just misses hits the armor crash shatters across it  laura fuck  matt is that your turn  laura yeah  matt all right vax  liam all right i want 
none	 to slam down right  laura sorry can i use my bonus to hide behind one of those pillars  matt sure go ahead and roll a stealth check  laura 16  matt okay  laura its foggy in this room  travis vax  liam yes all right slam down right by that ones head straight down to the ground  take a splitsecond to look up at the watery druid shake my fucking head stab stab right  into its face yeah okay so the first one is a 33  matt 33 hits  liam yeah 
none	 and the second one is 28  matt 28 hits  liam all right so hes prone hes at disadvantage im going to dump smite into both of  these yeah counting 36 plus the smite which is 32 39 for the first and then for the second hit  is two six eight plus the smite eight ten 12  matt total damage all right so as you slam down the first strike you jam it right into the chest  and as you pull back the blade you watch as one of the chest armor pieces flips open 
dung	 and the flames  the furnace of its chest that are starting to burn in again begin to fill with the water from the  water elemental and more steam emerges from it as its starting to feel the furnace burn out you  reach in with your dagger and find a cool spot and jam it right in the middle where you see one of  the embers is the brightest and as your hand goes in and strikes it the ember goes dark and  immediately the creature falls limp there  liam then so with the way 
none	 hunters mark works is i can move it to another as a bonus action can i  get it over to the one by grog  matt whats the range on it  liam oh jeez 90 feet okay so i should have a little bit of movement left so im going to shoot  back up highfive my girlfriend on the way and go as high as i can in the room  marisha it goes splat  matt yeah its like punching a fire hydrant all right so youre going to head over this way  liam im 
none	 only 60 feet because im not hasted wings  matt right but this also is a small area so between here its almost 30 feet there and then  30 feet up so youd probably be closer to here  liam okay awesome  matt yeah there you go that ends your turn grog youre up  travis all right this guy can obviously play heavy reckless great weapon master can i make  the first attack im going to try for the first time  matt and remember this round dont forget your retaliation ability  travis yeah right 
none	  matt you forget it a lot  travis i do i know im sorry i get confused im going to try a trip attack with my new  maneuvers its a d8 right thats added  matt to the damage but you still have to roll to hit first  travis okay reckless great weapon master 30 minus five is 25  matt 25 hits yeah  travis so 11 27 37 38 39 40 41  laura 41  matt 41 points of damage to it  travis and hes tripped oh he has to make a strength 
none	 saving throw  matt correct he actually got a 15 and your dc for your abilities do you have that figured out  you should have that figured out its eight plus your strength modifier plus your proficiency  bonus youre way over  travis oh okay cool  matt so six plus eight its 14 plus your strength bonus which is i believe eight yeah  travis 26  matt no not 26 its 14 plus eight  travis 76  matt yeah sure so with that first you knock it prone onto the ground tripping out from under 
none	  itself as you sweep across its legs you watch as one of the pauldrons thats built into its leg  splinters off and you can see the inner mechanisms of the constructs leg what do you  want to do for your second attack  travis i want to hit it again reckless great weapon master thank god for that seven shit  that might not be so good 20  matt 20 just barely hits  travis oh it hits okay one seven 17 oh 17 plus ten so 27  matt youre in melee too so the 
none	 reduce his ability doesnt really affect you since youre  right up against him how much was that damage total  travis 27  matt 27 points okay as you swipe it from under the ground and it falls onto its back it slams  hits the ground with a hard metallic clang using that momentum you swing back wham and  slam down on top of its chest which caves in briefly you can see bits of the flame of the  interior furnace flickering around the edges where the metals now crinkled inward exposing the  burning flame 
none	 is that your turn  travis can i spend an action surge to do one more strike into his gallagherafflicted chest  reckless great weapon master thats a lot 16 20 34 29  matt 29 hits roll damage you have two more attacks with your action surge  travis oh shit  laura its just another attack  taliesin welcome to my world man  travis 21 31  matt 31 hits  travis nice no 29 was the hit and 31 was the damage  matt 31 was the damage okay so as you pull your weapon up 
none	 from that first impact seeing the  damage its done you grin and you feel the veins bulge once more in your neck and you bring it up a  third time for this one slamming it down the chest caves in entirely and you watch it fall limp  as its arms detach and fall to the side its done you still have one more attack and you  havent moved  travis can i turn cracking to my right in my rage and start running across the room to old  stupid butt on the wall 50 feet 
none	  laura oh you got to it  travis last one reckless great weapon master  matt laughter okay  travis thats a million 35 30  matt yeah that hits  travis okay five 21 31  laura its so good when theyre within range of grog  matt yeah all righty that ends your turn grog that brings us to percival  taliesin im going to spend a point of deadeye to that last one thats on the ground and i think  that cancels out the disadvantage yeah lets just shoot him yeah thats a 27  
none	 matt 27 hits  taliesin thats ten points of damage two points of necrotic two points of psychic and do the  same thats 32  matt that hits  groaning  taliesin what a senseless waste of human life  laura and liam the tarot cards  taliesin tarot cards are fine  marisha theyre actually fine they were on the box  matt just let me know what magical items you need me to reprint out for you  taliesin all of them  marisha and your new dice box  laura can we get some paper towels 
none	  liam and taliesin ten points of coffee damage  laura it may have landed on some wires  taliesin thats nine points of normal damage two points of psychic damage six points of necrotic  matt okay  laura somebodys running now soon as we said wires  taliesin and for my third shot thats 30 points  matt that hits yeah  taliesin thats 17 points of normal damage four points of necrotic one point of psychic  matt okay so after grog rushed up and slammed in this ones chest he pulls back and actually pulls  
none	 the armored chest plate that retains the furnace in the inside off its still wedged on the axe  and as it pulls open you see the flame begin to spark and billow out of the chest how do you want to  do this  shouting  travis you are frenzied raging right now  taliesin i want to pour a cup of coffee  laughter  marisha morning traffic percys like groaning  taliesin im going to sit ive already got him second time im going to find very carefully every  little crack and im going to 
dung	 get him in there im going to listen to them bang around on the  interior im going to rattle them around  matt you hear the ricochet on the inside clanging as it does the flicker burns really  bright you can feel it almost burns into your beard but you pull away real fast almost like  looking out of the trap in ghostbusters so you turn away the flames crackle burn upward and  then immediately go dark afterward it falls and collapses to the ground there unmoving  travis i looked in the trap ray  
none	 marisha ugh no  taliesin its going to be fine  laura the worst its seriously under the box though on the wires  liam but coffee and wyrmwood are the two best things so youre mixing the two best things  yelling  laura its everywhere  taliesin holy cow i have a coffee problem  matt the coffeepocalypse has come to critical role this night  travis thats an eightounce cup its a normal cup of coffee  taliesin you would think and ive been drinking it all night  laura how is there so much coffee  
none	 taliesin i dont know  travis you can caffeinate half of burbank right there  taliesin ignore me  matt its hard to  so as you all take a moment to look around you can see that these three warriors now lie broken  and destroyed on the ground whether it be drowned torn apart internally or bludgeoned in  the center of their chest cavity they are no longer moving you still now in the quiet hear  the rhythmic steady banging thats been perpetually feeding into the distant background of  this entire structure deep beneath the 
none	 volcano what do you want to do  travis can i look at the golem the construct thats down by me is his face the triangle face  is it detachable can i remove it from the rest of his person  taliesin we can always put it underneath the smelter and pour in  matt make an investigation check  travis hold onto your butts thats a one  matt theres no button for it theres the old fashioned way  liam im going to land down next to the other one and start looking in the same fashion 
none	 across the  room  matt make an investigation check  laura im going to cast cure wounds on myself  matt all right go for it  travis and i will do it the old fashioned way  matt so make a strength check please  liam 27  matt like most of its armored pieces the arms detach but the head is a solid jointed portion to  the torso  travis 22  matt 22 and as youre inspecting this you hear this horrible clanging sound in the distance as  you see grog with his foot 
none	 up on the center of the armored clavicle piece yanks the head off of it  tearing causing the metal to bend back and spring for a moment in the air  travis look its just like the one above the coals  liam oh thats how you do it  laura good job grog  taliesin weve got to do all three heads  travis thats an interesting phrase  laura see if you can smelt some platinum into that thing grog should it be platinum should  probably be platinum yeah  taliesin we have the platinum lets 
none	 see what happens lets smelt the platinum into the heads  laura you know how to do it because youre a blacksmith now  travis were not supposed to like kissyface the heads to make some sort of a 3d shape  laura no its already got a pyramid in it  travis good deal  taliesin i think were going to put all three into the one  travis sounds like a plan can i go over and archaically remove the other two noggins  matt sure  sam may i assist by holding the bodies with bigbys hand 
none	 while you pull the heads  matt yes actually make a strength check with advantage grog  travis 23  matt yeah so with bigbys hand wrapping around the body clutching it like an action figure you  very easily crack pop the head off and you now have two disembodied heads  travis one more do you want to help me with this one too yeah whats wrong with your voice 18  matt 18 groaning it takes a little while and it pulls off but its mildly deformed from being  pulled off it seems like the hole 
none	 in the face is intact it took so hard a try  travis we got the ashtrays  taliesin thatll do lets try this  travis all right we head over to the smelting apparati  matt okay so you walk on over and its a small furnace built in there with extremely hot coals  and it seems to be an influx of perpetual heat but theres a large bellows next to it that you can  use to try and increase the heat there for a temporary short time and you once again  strangely you look over 
none	 to it and you know exactly how this works like youve always worked with it  before so the flames that were a burning orangered extremely hot begin to flare into  bright yellow and white in places and the heat emanating from it is enough that it causes a lot  of you to get uncomfortable in the presence and you have to take a step back grog enduring it  marisha im still a fire hydrant keyleth is on fire marshal duty i do some misting like at six  flags to cool off vex  travis you 
none	 cant just run through you like universal city walk or something  marisha yeah mainly just to make vex sexy thats really all im going for i turned into an  elemental ive got to do something with it  matt make a check with your blacksmithing tools which is your proficiency modifier and well say  for this because it is more of a dextrous use of this skill add your dexterity modifier  travis okay 24  matt 24 so in setting up preparation you take each one of the heads and to fill each one of  
none	 their i want to say concave but its an interior pyramid space convex is outward it will  be about 100 platinum pieces or so to fill each face void so you take the platinum you melt it  down into the smelter get it to where its in the gripped tongheld metallic reservoir until it  eventually melts down you then pour it into each of the heads so 300 platinum utilized to do this  it fills to the very edge some of it spills over but you can easily snip that off as you wait for  
none	 it to cool which you can probably help with actually as there is no basin for quenching the  metal at the moment so the steam whoosh rises up all around and you turn the heads over and  each one sliding sound leaves these heavy metallic pyramid pieces that are smooth and  perfect on three of the sides and one of them appears to be almost like a broken crystal on the  inside its a shattered messedup section  laura puzzle piece got to fit them together  taliesin okay so if we fit these together  
none	 matt they seem to fit together very well you figured it out very quickly they fit and hold  together  laura with the jaggedy ends or with the smooth ends  matt the jaggedy ends all fit together  taliesin does this now make another concave piece  matt all together it makes a pyramid that comes to a central point  laura shouting lets put it in the big thing  taliesin so ive still got some spider climb so im going to grab one and lift up all the  fliers  laura yep lets go  
none	 matt okay so the three of you make it up fit it together push it in it fits in perfectly slips  in you all back up nothing  laura we push it in harder  matt all right make a strength check  laura this is definitely going to be really good  liam i push on my sisters shoulder blades  laura 15  laura and liam groaning  matt right you guys groans get behind and shove push nothing  travis can i try  laura yeah grog you try  travis i run across the coal 
none	 pits and superman punch the pyramid  liam i barrelroll out of the way  travis i rage before i do this  laura oh jesus theres a dent in it now  matt you get advantage on this then  travis thats what i was hoping for 21  matt impact noise the impact on this causes the whole room to shake almost from the blast you  hear the echo right up the stairs in the hallway that you emerged from you can hear continuing as  it slowly dissipates in the distance you land and you can 
none	 see theres actually a knuckle mark in  the platinum from the impact no effect  laura hey ive got an idea what if we take this thing off of the cross beams right and stick it  in the coals or something because why are the coals here right underneath it  marisha i drop water elemental form you think it needs to be hot first  laura i dont know  marisha i look up i line up the apparatus and look across the room does it feel like theres  any other indiana jones  matt the 
none	 stairway is in the way because the stairway doesnt come all the way to the top of  the ceiling and then back here it blocks this passage between the two of them but as you go and  look all it is is the reddish rust colored crossbeams that are bolted against the wall and  in the center theres the round golden crest with the triangle shape which is now filled with the  platinum key that youve made  taliesin are the coals hot or are the coals cold  matt the coals are currently now cold 
none	  travis should we try turning it  laura oh yeah good idea but we should reignite these coals because i think its bad that theyve  burned down right now  marisha i think so too just to test yeah im going to do burning hands how quickly do they  catch  matt pretty quickly and you get the sense that they were slowly catching anyway theres  something about them the heat that the general room perpetually emanates maintains the fires  within but your flame with the burning hands very quickly elevates and quickens that process 
none	 and  you watch as the coals now glow to a bright orangered hue and you can feel the heat  emanating from them  laura can we turn the circle does it move  matt so you go up to the edge and you grab the edge of the golden crest and tug and its not  moving  laura gosh darn it what are we supposed to do  marisha are there any inlays  matt make an investigation check  marisha okay its not my strong point goddamn it thats like the fourth three ive rolled  
none	 today  sam hey youre inspired  matt laughter you are inspired up to you  marisha better 12  matt 12 its smooth gold theres no signs or runes or anything on the side  taliesin i want to see if theres anything in the holes that were left by the soldiers who left  matt what was that  taliesin the three suits of armor came out of the wall so theres now a wall that we havent seen  behind them  laura maybe its supposed to be gold  marisha platinum is for the trammels  
none	 matt okay so you go ahead and look inside which one  taliesin im going to do all three but ill start on the one on the left  matt okay roll an investigation check  taliesin thats investigation check what did you do six  marisha is that also a three  taliesin yeah its also a three  matt you look around inside and the shape is a perfect indentation of the physical form of the  three metal warriors you dont see any signs of anything beyond enough of a cavity to fit them  snugly when 
none	 theyre dormant  liam hey scanlan you want to use your dragon fisting friend to put that pyramid in the coals  and heat it up and then shove it back in  sam wait what  liam do you want to use bigbys hand to take that pyramid shove it in the coals heat it up and  see if that makes a difference shove it back in hot  sam so you want me to heat the platinum and then shove into the guys face  matt bigbys hand by the way at this time has faded it 
none	 only lasts for a minute with  concentration the spell has faded  liam well maybe the pyramid heated up could make a difference  travis all right i walk up into the coals take the platinum pyramid out and ill drop it down  into the coals  matt okay its about 15 feet up off the ground  travis shit can i jump boots of feral leaping  matt you can id say you leap up and grab the edges of the seal with your giant strength and  wedge your fingers in the side and pull it 
none	 out and land on the coals you do take four points of fire  damage as the coals begin to burn into your feet and the proximity of the heat but you  back up out of the coal based center now holding the key  travis i drop it in the coals  matt okay the three pieces come apart as soon as you pull it from the section so you have the  three different pieces right there in your arms  taliesin so when three pieces go together the part that goes towards the wall  matt 
none	 its another point its like a foursided pyramid  taliesin all right it is a pyramid so the whole pyramid goes in the wall  matt yeah its a flat seal on the outside  laura i think this needs to be gold dear  taliesin why would it be gold  laura well the outside is gold  taliesin thats true  marisha maybe the platinum is only for the trammels not the key  laura we can try it we have gold  liam finish my stupid idea and then well move onto the next stupid one  
none	 laura good call  travis has the platinum pyramid started to heat up yet  matt youre holding it in your arms  travis i drop it in the coals  matt okay you drop it in the coals you wait about five minutes or so and you can see a faint  bit of heated glow slowly heating up but these  coals are not smelter ready  travis you know what i feel like i feel like this is stupid i pick them up pained gasps  tell me where they go  matt okay make an intelligence 
none	 check grog to assemble the three puzzle pieces of the key  travis negative two nine  matt laughs hes having a hard time putting those pieces together guys  liam i fly over im deathwalkers warded to fire and im going to start helping  matt all right you each take five points of fire damage just helping touch and assemble this key  once you get it put together you hold it in the grasp of your hands you leap using the boots of feral  leaping jam it back inside land off to the side nothing  
dung	 travis asshole son of a bitch  laura we got to fucking try it in gold try it in gold maybe try it in gold  taliesin i have one other thought  sam what  laura what is it  taliesin whats the red armor made out of  laura gasps what are the armors made out of  matt its a dark reddishblack metal  laura can we melt the golems into their heads  travis what  laura melt each one maybe its got to be the metal theyre made out of  travis the triangles are 
none	 like this big and the armor is like massive  laura yeah so take some of the metal and melt it down into the head  marisha what is the metal can we do a check to see what kind of metal it is what its made out of  matt either of these guys can attempt to do that  taliesin i can take a look what would that be  matt this would be an intelligence check plus your tinkering benefit intelligence check plus  your blacksmithing proficiency modifier  taliesin so thats intelligence plus my normal tinker 
none	 check  matt yeah  taliesin so thats not bad lets see  travis 19  taliesin oh wow thats 32  matt okay so both of you say out loud at the same time oh this is volcanic glass metal  taliesin and travis volcanic glass metal aha  laura so maybe can we melt it  taliesin only in a glass volcano no i think it will melt  travis do i know if volcanic  matt yeah its a travis its  matt laughs its a type of metal travis its a type of metal  matt 
none	 youre following me on this  travis yeah im following you on it  matt okay its an oxidized red iron base that in the construct and the folding of the metal to  build the actual armored structure of these creatures had bits of volcanic glass folded into  the actual metal as it was created  laura i feel like that makes it special  travis laughs bring on the night king  taliesin we can give it a shot cant we  travis melt them down into each of the three  liam why dont you make 
none	 their dreams come true and rip their groins off  laura melt their body into their face and make triangles out of the metal  matt okay so because you rolled a very high check ill let you know that generally heating up a  metal to the point in which its liquid and then pouring it into the same metal is going to mess up  the mold  taliesin thats a terrible idea lets try gold i would have felt very foolish  laura you guys are so smart about this stuff then we should do gold  
none	 travis it comes it comes in waves its like a new awakening  taliesin well try the gold  matt okay so about a hundred gold pieces per head so 300 gold pieces removed  laura wait how come it was 300 oh its not the same worth its the coin  matt well its a hundred gold pieces per face so its 300 gold pieces total so 300 gold taken off  total you smelt it down same process and then place within each of the three molds wait for it  to cool and then you remove the 
none	 three key pieces of the solid gold they all fit together just as  the platinum pieces did  travis can somebody go pull that thing out and then i will put this one in  taliesin im pulling it out  matt okay so you go ahead and you pull out the chunks of heated now cooling platinum and drop  them into the coals for a moment you pull them off the coals carefully  travis can i run up and mj the new gold pyramid into the  matt sure make an intelligence check  travis an 
none	 intelligence check oh because i got to put them together two  matt grog is having a hard time with that okay  travis im making an origami swan  matt laughs all right you guys eventually help him put it together a second time  liam that is a really good macaroni art youve made its so good thats a boat right  laura lets put it in the key  matt all right so as they have it assembled you rush up leap jam it in up there and it slides  into place you hear a heavy 
none	 slamming sound and what sounds like the scraping of heavy chain  mail metallic scraping  travis i grab the platinum pyramid and i put it in the bag of holding  laura no i already said that i had them no no he doesnt do that  matt the wall immediately shudders and you see a layer of dust and soot falling sand off of it  as it falls to rest onto the ground and you see the wall slowly rise up grinding gears  marisha wait i want to prep something hide  matt okay so whos 
none	 hiding  liam i am  matt all right stealth check  laura yeah and im hiding behind the pillar that im next to  matt all right so you hide behind there  travis scanlan face death with me  sam this is bullshit im going to stand there hands on hips  marisha ill hug the wall closest to the door  matt okay all right  travis its just going to reveal another stairway come on  taliesin its going to be another door  travis did you guys see national treasure  taliesin no  travis 
none	 what  taliesin no i never saw national treasure  laura oh my god its so good  taliesin okay well well make an evening of it  marisha its nick cage at his most mediocre  laura st nicholas  matt as the door eventually comes to a stop maybe a foot before it reaches the ceiling black smoke  pours in from the other chamber you watch as it immediately fills the ceiling and then begins to  dissipate up the stairway and the hallway above you where you guys originally descended from you  see flashes of 
none	 sparks and embers through these clouds of black smoke and soot within the chamber  its obscuring most of your view within the inside and that heavy pounding that pounding  is much louder now you can sense that it is actually the source of that rhythmic beat that  metalonmetal clang you have been feeling since you first came into this series of chambers  you can see small streams of glowing orange molten rock within the chamber which is slightly down  and before you looks like two small tenfootwide rivers of molten rock metal you cant quite 
dung	  tell from here but its glowing orange and red and they both convene and go dark in the center  where it looks like they are being covered or obscured by something that you cant quite make  out at this distance  laura a giant anvil  matt make a perception check anybody who wants to glance in right now the only people who can  look in would not be percival and vax because they are in the way back and keyleth is hiding if you  want to glance in the side you can  marisha 
none	 i can do a peek  matt sure  laura 17  travis 16  marisha 24  laura that sound is creepy as fuck  taliesin i know its a lot of sound  matt what you can make out for the most part is this central platform is raised it looks like theres  a staircase that leads up to a middle platform that is in the center of this larger chamber and  it looks to be a couple of large heavy platforms or pillars that have roaring flames at the edges  of them you can 
none	 see beneath it the two pools of lava that disappear beneath it and you see a hint  of a spiral staircase on each side that curls around the back end of where those two rivers of  molten rock meet behind that you see the flashes sparking like these rhythmic engines of  sparks that are pouring out of the black smoke that is perpetually filling the upper part of this  chamber however since now it has a place to escape the room is slowly revealing the interior  you can see on top of this platform in 
dung	 the center a large dark metal object roughly four or five  feet from front to back and about three feet wide of dark jet black metal with small veins of  glowing red and orange that curl around it that occasionally flare with each impact of whatever  this rhythmic metal clanging is behind it  as the smoke begins to dissipate even further more visibility reveals the shape of this object  to definitely be that of an anvil you can see a number of chains that are linked to it on each side that  dangle off 
none	 the edge you cannot quite see whats at the end of these chains theyre falling off  the side of this platform and out of view youd have to get closer to see what they are however  the shape that you now see right behind this platform looming at about 20 feet tall from your  estimation at this distance keyleth as you are the one who sees this before anybody else does you  see a stocky humanoid form that is looming over the anvil both of its fists resting on each side  of the platform you 
dung	 can see its trunklike arms and legs are dark gray stone and the head carries  no face it is a smooth absence of face you can see red cables that dangle from the top and the  back of the head that are then pulled together in the back like a ponytail and around the center of  its torso and its lower body these extremely thick layers of leather wrap that make a kilt  that dangles past the knees of this giant stone structure that stands there looming over in one  of its hands you see 
none	 a comparably small but impressivelooking hammer of gold and black that  is currently chained to the platform its the one that isnt currently dangling off the side its  in its hand and its resting there and you can see the heat emanating from both the pools of  molten rocks on the side of it and the flames behind most of the imagery is perpetually  shifting and being altered by the sheer volume of heat that this chamber holds this is apparently  the core anvil and whatever decor around it looks very intimidating what do you 
none	 want to do  marisha the humanoid figure doesnt seem to have noticed us hes not moving  matt its not moving its standing there right at the platform  laura over the anvil  travis is that sound still happening  matt yep  laura and the figure is 20 feet fall you said  matt yeah you dont see the ceiling in here because its all filled with black smoke  travis can we see the source of the sound can we see whats causing that yet  matt you cant right now its behind that entity and 
none	 you see behind where the platform is  the darkened back portion of the chamber these two flashes of spark and flame as they do you see  bursts of smoke and flame billow up and continue to fill and feed the ceiling  marisha i convey what i see i think you might have a guardian you have to fight over that  hammer grog  laura oh no again  liam i creep up past my sister and place a hand on his knee which is in my fucking face  marisha if we can take 60 seconds 
none	 i back up into a corner and start casting conjure elemental and  conjure another water elemental to be on our side from the staff  laura maybe hes a friendly giant really creepylooking entity  marisha maybe hes the guy who tried to use the anvil before  laura maybe hes the allfather is that what hes called  matt allhammer  travis well look before we step into that arena we control this space how quick and quiet  can you be to see if he responds to your movement  liam i can get in there  
none	 laura in and out super fast  liam sure you want me to get a look  travis yeah see if he reacts to you  laura dart up to him and go taunting and then dart back  marisha hang on we might want to be careful about getting too high theres a lot of smoke in  there we dont want to suffocate  sam thats the only time marisha has ever said those words  laughter  marisha were live on the fucking internet sam riegel  sam hope your moms watching  liam thanks for watching 
none	 everybody thats the end of tonights show oh my gosh  matt what are you guys doing  liam can you add any of your secret sauce to my sneaking  matt you have to stay within a certain radius of her to get the effect  liam never mind ill be fine  travis yeah do it this is what you do  laura just fly in really fast be creepy and quick  liam do i need to do an additional stealth creepy is automatic its a given  matt because this is heading into the chamber as 
dung	 opposed to just staying behind the platform yes  you have to roll again  liam okay natural 20  taliesin we dont even notice him leave  matt so you head into the chamber okay as you make your way inside you look left and right and  you can see the dark stonework begins to mingle with the metal and begins to go into the rough  edges of the volcanic rock that its built into you see two large pillars to each side of you that  have these red rocks embedded in the side that give 
none	 this faint red glow that gives a hint of  light to the chamber theres the heat from the pools the whole chamber in here is very  uncomfortable for you thankfully your armor giving you heat resistance does help a bit you  can see the anvil on top of the staircase on the raised platform and that large hulking entity  thats looming over it at the moment  liam if hes here and im over here can i fly up just there so i can see the front of him a bit the  angle of his 
none	 face if there is one anything to see or is he facing out towards us  matt hes facing out towards you  liam never mind then shoot  laura youve got fuzz on your face can i get it no you got it it was right on his lip so every  time he talked  liam nice  matt so what are you doing  taliesin be bold  liam float in space and do that  matt okay you fly up that is not stealthy  liam no from where i am im not making noise im 
none	 not flying closer to him im just doing this  whatever you want to do  marisha i stealthily get his attention by waving my hand in his face  matt theres a difference between stalking off in the corner and flying up into the center to  get a look and then seeing if he sees you so what are you doing you have to distinguish that  liam okay im going to fly back to the gang could you pick this fuzz off my face i couldnt  get it off the whole time it just keeps reaffixing 
none	 i dont know i flew in and out  taliesin were going to have to get his attention somehow  laura its got to be you because youre so fast if you get his attention you can dart out  really fast  liam so what do we think were doing here are we talking to this thing  laura should we try talking to him  travis we might  laura maybe its better  taliesin its a crazy plan but it just might work  laura you can speak celestial too right you dont just read it  
none	 taliesin gefülten yes i speak celestial  laughs  travis oh man swedish chef over here  matt so we now have as exandria canon that celestial sounds like swedish  taliesin you can bury that as deep as you want  matt thank you for that taliesin  laura i thought celestial sounded more like singing  taliesin well you know its like a whole thing  liam can i get another quick rerundown of the room so he was up at the top of the stairs  facing out not moving and was that wall behind him or 
none	 does it go further past him at all  matt id say about 15 feet behind him you can see the occasional reflection of the flashes of light  where it looks to be there is a wall behind him there is an end to the chamber but youre  too far away and its too obscured by smoke for you to know exactly whats behind him  liam and when i got in there i didnt get close enough to see if there was any good hiding spots  beyond him  matt make a perception check  liam 
none	 24  matt 24 there are corners to the chamber as you fly up and glance you can see two more small  equalsized pits of coals behind him on either side and you do glance two 20footwide domed  machines that you see the flame and the billowing smoke are being pushed out of its a weird  enginelike structure with two of them behind it that you can see the flames hammering and  thats where the sparks are shooting out of each time  liam do the talking thing im going to go back in  marisha 
none	 before we start how long has it been since we entered this chamber  matt its been maybe ten minutes  marisha entered into the volcano  matt oh into the volcano  marisha yeah entered into the first forge room im trying to find out if freedom of movement is  still on  matt okay with all of the smelting put together id say its probably been close to an hour  marisha can i only have one condition effect on him or can i stack them up  matt you can have as many as you put 
none	 on him if theyre not concentration you can stack as many  as you want  marisha okay freedom of movement is not im going to cast freedom of movement on you again  and then i think enhance ability is though so im going to use my concentration to give you  cats grace right you were using dexterity for the smelting  travis yeah on that one  taliesin yeah its would be dex or strength  matt for most blacksmithing you gather that it will be dex or strength  travis well strength is way better than 
none	 dex  marisha then ill give you cats grace you have advantage on dex checks  liam and dm how long were we in this room  matt in that room since you entered that chamber its been about an hour  liam its been an hour my wings then are  matt at this point yeah your wings have now dissipated  travis percy im not afraid go talk to this thing  taliesin in celestial im going to say hello im going to say it out  matt you shout it into the chamber  taliesin hello we 
none	 come seeking the allhammer we need help vecna walks the earth again we come  seeking a way to defeat him once again  laura tell him we were sent by pelor  taliesin we come with the blessings of pelor and im going to start entering very gingerly  travis im right behind you  matt okay so percival is entering  liam actually ill throw out that i crept back in ahead of that so in there hiding  laura im floating behind him on a broom  matt all righty scanlan where are you coming in on 
none	 this  sam i will lag behind grog  matt so we have percival walking in and who is right behind percival  taliesin grog  matt grog all righty scanlan right behind grog  laura does it have to be single file with this  matt no it doesnt  laura okay then im going to be back over to the side of scanlan  matt all right keyleth  marisha ill take up the rears with my water elemental  laura the ground is still super duper hot right  matt the ground is yes all righty so 
dung	 as you begin to enter the chamber and make your way  towards the stairway and this central raised platform with the two flaming pillars that flank  it shouting this into the chamber it echoes through and you still hear the hammering each  flash of light causes this faint glow across your faces and the faces of your companions as their  shapes go from dark obscured in the shadow and smoke into a brief reveal of your form as you  begin to approach the stairs you hear this faint grinding of stone as the faceless giants 
none	 head  slowly looks up to face you but thats all  taliesin i keep walking  travis me too  matt okay as you guys continue to walk you get to the bottom of the stairs and you watch as one  of its hands on the side that clutches the hammer unfurls and releases it and the hammer once let  go swings the chain going taut and it slams into the side of the raised platform out of sight and  as it does it stands up and rights itself but its head is still looking down 
none	 at you percival  taliesin we ask permission to use the anvil  laura tell him nod yes once for yes and shake his head no  travis how about this im not afraid if he takes offense ill take it better than most  taliesin thats fair  matt so do you ascend the stairs  travis i am in the front now  matt grog has now moved to the front all right and you take your first couple steps onto the  stairs as you do the large stone entity spins around and steps into the smoke 
none	 that obscures its  shoulders  laura im going to cast cure wounds on myself one more time while this is happening  liam im going to down a potion and then a quick question too hunters mark has a duration of an  hour but since that last battle lapsed am i then not allowed to slide it to this guy  matt no its gone now it has been more time the process of smelting and then resmelting and  figuring out and adjusting everything it has taken over an hour sorry  travis can i use my 
none	 second wind just because  matt sure  taliesin man i could really use spider climb right now goddamn it  travis heal 13 points  matt all righty so as you continue to step up the stairs grog as you approach you get about a  third of the way up there and you hear what sounds like heavy metal scraping against stone and one  giant burst of sound you watch as the giant figure shifts and turns back out of the smoke  holding across its front in one hand a large cleaverlike blade with runes glowing 
none	 across the  side of it about 15 feet or so from end to end and as it spins it looks down towards you all and  holds it in front the flat end facing out towards you in a ceremonial way  taliesin what kind of runes  matt make an arcana check  laura maybe if you use it the right way it will be fine  taliesin 11  matt you have no idea  taliesin okay  marisha are they runes or a language is it a script  matt these are specifically arcane runes of 
dung	 an enchantmenttype nature its holding the blade  out in front like that clutching the handle on one side and putting its hand against the flat of  the blade in the other  taliesin do we have our bits of god  laura yeah  taliesin we might want to have them available for the moment  laura yeah i take mine out of my pocket  matt so grog go up to the top you make it to the very top of the stairs and there is the anvil  there before you and the heat you can 
none	 feel you know when youre close to an explosion and theres  that brief minute of extremely uncomfortable heat that you flinch its that perpetually and  all of you are sweating masses beneath your armor youre afraid at certain points that your  eyebrows are beginning to singe and curl its hard to breathe because the air is so hot and so  thick and occasionally you cant help but find yourself coughing at the caustic black smoke that  fills a large portion of the chamber  travis i am consciously checking my beard  matt okay as 
none	 you approach the top of the stairs the head looks down at you what do you do  travis am i standing at the anvil now  matt youre standing right at the edge of the stairs the very top of the platform and the  anvils maybe five feet in front of you you can see all the chains that are hanging on the side  and dangling off the sides of the platform  travis can i see where the chains are leading or are they just dangling off  matt the platform is about 20 feet wide 
none	 and so the chains that are all hooked at multiple places  to the edges and the outside part of the anvil are taut and then dangling off the edge of the  platform so you cant see where it goes you know one of them is the hammer because thats what he  let fly off the side  taliesin i kept track of which one was the hammer  travis give me the platinum  laura okay  travis well put it together first please thanks with the platinum i will approach the  anvil  matt okay 
none	 you step up to the edge of the anvil as it does the blade tilts so that now as  opposed to the flat facing you one of the two bladed edges is now  travis i stop  laura in your vision of how to do it did you see this guy  travis did i no do i see any blacksmithing tools anything that i would use to hammer this  laura the hammer that he let go of  travis oh thats hanging off  matt you saw that but you didnt get a great look at 
none	 it by the time it was chucked off the side  travis flat edge that does feel like a ready set  laura and marisha yeah  travis i take one step back  matt the blade goes to a flat  marisha so next after the edge is decapitation  travis im pretty sure that would be 150 points of damage  laura what if you go and try to pick up that hammer first do you need it  travis im picturing the anvil right in front of me and hes off to the side right  matt 
none	 the anvil is right in front of you hes on the other side of the anvil you only see the  upper part of the torso because hes standing off the platform below it so you see him from the waist  up hes about 20 feet tall from top to bottom you only see ten feet of his torso there the  blades out in front  travis and the hammer is somewhere between me and him  matt yeah make a perception check to see if you remember which chain it was  travis seven  matt theres 
none	 four chains on each side that are dangling off the side and you are not sure which one it is  travis oh it went hanging off  matt it went held off the side so now there are four chains that are taut on each side of the  anvil that are vanishing  taliesin is he another golem  matt it looks to be a golemlike construct yeah you have seen golems and you have encountered  golems before and the constructs of them can vary this one elements of it have the same  proportions of a 
dung	 golem but there are elements that seem more humanlike as opposed to an armored  battering ram the refined details of it no your perception roll isnt high enough and youre  too far away to make out much more of its form  laura is his sword as big as our table is across  sam oh what if we show him one of our little beans  laura well i pulled mine out  sam maybe you have to show him how good a blacksmith you are to earn the privilege  travis yeah but ive got to 
none	 get to the anvil to do that  matt yeah the blade in his hand just the blade from hilt to end is about 15 feet long  marisha scanlan can you read the arcane runes on his sword do you know what this enchantment is  sam i can certainly try  matt make an arcana check scanlan as you glance over stepping into the edge of the stairs  marisha can i help him  matt no its purely based on his knowledge  laura youve got this scanlan come on  sam this is arcana  matt 
none	 yes  liam come on vacation scanlan  sam its a 21  matt 21 the runes across the blade specifically deal with cursing the physical form of what  touches its blade  travis shit okay cool instead of walking towards the anvil can i start walking to the  right towards one of those chains thats dangling on  matt the chains are immediately to the left and right of the anvil so to go towards the chain  youd be stepping closer to the anvil and as you turn to the side its head tracks you as 
none	 you go  travis is it tilting it down  matt you havent moved forward so no  travis okay can i keep moving in that direction  matt okay you begin to step forward towards the chain the blade comes down to a flat end towards you  travis ill stop  taliesin im going to try and sneak around the side of it whats behind it  matt make a perception check  taliesin 19  matt okay glancing over what you can see between the smoke you see the two pits of burning coals  to the 
dung	 behind right and left of it with small steps that lead into the coals on each side and you see the  two edges of these large cylindrical turbines of stone and metal where the impacts are and the  flames flickering off it  taliesin are those bellows or is it more complicated  matt youre not sure a lot of it is obscured from the smoke thats spilling out of it and youre  too far and the lights too dark in here from that distance  taliesin what would happen if we put that machine out  
none	 laura well its not like you can step up to the anvil before the metals hot anyway right so  maybe were stepping up to the anvil too soon maybe you have to heat the metal first  taliesin i think that it feels like a guardian what if we put the water elemental in the  marisha i was just going to say im going to come into the room a little bit  matt okay so you step in most of you are  at the base of the stairs grog is at the top of  the 
none	 stairs scanlan stepped up behind him to look at the runes on the blade thats where you  currently reside  marisha is his eyesight still trained on grog  matt correct  marisha im going to send my water elemental forward and see if it attracts its attention  since its not a mortal  matt where do you send it  marisha towards the anvil  matt okay so you head up the stairs the water elemental swarms around the side you see wherever  it moves forward theres steam pouring off from the heat of the ground 
none	 and the surrounding metal  and stone as it comes up the steps more and more steam sizzling emerging off the back of its  body it comes to the top and its now next to grog you send it towards the anvil  marisha yeah but didnt grog train to the right  matt grog stepped to the right and then began to step forward and then stopped  marisha does the water elemental seem to be catching its attention at all or is it still  looking at grog  matt its still looking at grog  marisha 
none	 can i move the elemental to the left to see if it follows the elemental  matt okay the elemental moves to the left it doesnt follow the elemental  laura i wouldnt send him any closer to the anvil though  travis well he might swing at the thing if it got closer  marisha thats what im wondering  laura it might send him in attack mode  travis so unless were short on ideas we might have to starburst this thing scatter it  sam who forged here before what god  matt the allhammer  travis 
none	 ioun helped pelor helped  sam well should we show our god shit did we do that yet  laura well yeah im going to fly up next to grog but im not going to go past him and im  going to hold up the little bead of power  matt okay his attention focuses in between the two of you doesnt change his stance the blade  is still tilted down towards you  laura im going to step one step forward with it no further than grog stepped that first time  matt right yeah the blade 
none	 is still turned towards you doesnt seem to react  laura all right i back up fuck  travis you thinkers better think  taliesin i want to put the engineering behind it out i want to put those pistons out  marisha but what if the pistons are fueling the fires the forge  travis we still cant see whats sending up those  matt youre not close enough and you dont have a far enough view its blocking the bulk of it  laura im going to fly to the side against the wall  travis what about 
none	 an oracle arrow  laura yeah thats what i was going to do so i could shoot it around  matt okay so you fly off to the side of the chamber  laura yeah and im going to shoot an oracle arrow behind him to see whats going on over there  matt okay you go and fire the arrow just past him as you do his head darts with the speed of  the arrow as it clacks against the back of the wall without even looking towards you this hand  releases the blade and the blade 
none	 swings a wide arc about a foot above your head grog whoosh slams  something in the back of the wall out of sight you hear what sounds like a heavy chain snapping  and falling to the ground and the wall behind you where you entered the chamber crash slams shut  as you all hear the sound and take in the scenery you watch as it retracts the blade into an  offensive position and were going to take a break well be back here in just a moment guys  we have a giveaway  laura i

none	 taliesin you can get a pin you can get a hoodie you can get any form you want  liam i know you so ill ask you later too  marisha yeah okay  matt all right then so last we left off you had made your way into the chamber that holds the  core anvil beneath the underwater volcano of scaldseat upon approaching the central risen  platform where the anvil was some stonebuilt guardian that loomed over it upon approaching and  testing the boundaries an unintentional firing of an arrow in the vicinity seemed to have 
none	  triggered an aggressive stance and the entity seems to be on the assault so now with the  chamber there before you i would like you all to take stock on your current positions and roll  initiative  liam hes going to hit you like he is at a driving range  travis yeah yeah like teeball  marisha im also rolling for my elemental  travis oh thats really unfortunate i get advantage on those and that was terrible  matt all righty so 25 to 20  taliesin 24  liam 20 jeez  matt all 
none	 righty 20 to 15  travis 20 to 15 for the love of god  matt okay 15 to ten  laura 14  sam 12  marisha 11 for my elemental  taliesin what  marisha 11 for my elemental  taliesin youre not okay  matt ten to five  travis and marisha six  taliesin oh six  laura we are fucked  matt top of the round as the large forge guardian stands with its giant rune blade before  it percival youre up first what are you doing  laura make peace  laughter  
none	 travis when the dm smirks like that  taliesin im going to bake a pie and deliver it okay im going to run back towards that red  crystal  matt this one  taliesin yep i run that direction and then im going to use my bonus action to do that im going  to hold my attack until his attack  matt okay good to know all right that ends percivals turn holding his action to attack when  it attacks vax youre up  liam oh jeez you know what i tell you what im going to 
none	 do im going to run over right next to  keyleth  matt all righty 20 25 30 thats about as far as you can get on regular movement  liam right i know what i want to do here is percy within 30 feet of me  matt percy is yes  liam okay im going to cast bless on scanlan keyleth and percy  matt okay  sam what does that do  laura obviously doesnt give a shit about me any more  marisha well you stole the boots  laura i gave them back  liam 
none	 youre so capable you bless up to three creatures of your choice within range whenever a  target makes an attack roll or a saving throw before this spell ends the target can roll a d4  and add the number so you three  marisha attack roll or saving throw  matt yes you can add a d4 to it your movement and your action  liam thats my action i have a bonus action this is an intimidating map matt i am going to  roll backward and sit underneath my sister and her judgemental ass  matt 
none	 okay so youre going to dash over under her  liam yep  matt there you go  laura top of my turn im going to fart  matt chuckles its how she propels the broom  marisha it immediately catches your butt on fire because were surrounded by methane gas you take  four damage  laura and youre on fire  marisha and youre on fire yeah  taliesin this is really intimidating the crystals are glowing and it makes me unhappy is  your crystal red too  gasping  taliesin no not cool  laura he 
none	 can walk he can move  matt steps leaps  liam fuck yourself wow  matt it lands in the center  travis look at him winding up this is awful  matt with his legs down straddling the two sides of this and hes going to go into a blade storm  and spins around in a wide arc  taliesin okay so if hes going to do this i was holding my attack im taking my attack now right  before this happens he has no face does he  matt currently you do not see a face 
none	 no  taliesin theres no face so if i were to make a head attack that would probably be really goddamn  useless one way to find out  marisha well he has a head you can have a face and not a head  travis and taliesin maybe its a mask  laura maybe its an illusion  taliesin fire a grit  marisha did you custom mess with this figure you did didnt you  matt just to cover the face  taliesin to hide his shame do i add the d4 to this if i so am 
none	 inclined  matt yes  taliesin and i can do it every time  matt every attack yeah  taliesin oh wow this is so nuts so first attack out of curiosity does it keep my misfire  does it knock me out of misfire technically  matt its still rolling on the d20  taliesin goddamn it okay lets put that away then and lets take some psychic damage because  thats funny oh thats great okay  matt nine points of psychic damage  taliesin yeah so 142 thats cool ow im going to put that down and 
none	 get a bigger gun and try that  again and that blows that grit as well much better no its not oh my god oh my fucking  god its just doing it never mind im going to blow the rest of it and spend the end of my turn  trying to fix one of my guns really quickly and do a quick clearout which is 12 versus misfire  on the psychic and i do  matt you manage to clear the weapon  taliesin i cleared animus bad news is still out of commission and thats my 
none	 turn never mind  matt so as the blade storm it does a large sweep all the way around it with the blade hitting  everything within 15 feet of it  sam is it an automatic hit or is it something i can do cutting words on  matt its a roll to hit but cutting words would affect a single attack against an individual  yeah because each attack roll is separate so it would affect one of the attack rolls  sam well i will cutting words it for my attack no hes going to hit me 
none	 no matter what whos in  the path  matt well lets find out first so its going to be vex vax scanlan and grog and then keyleth  and percy are out of range as well as the elemental so against vex that is a 17  laura doesnt hit  matt doesnt it and you dodge out of the way for vax 17  liam nope  matt rolled two threes in a row striking around to grog that is a 24  travis thatll hit can i try my parry maneuver  matt what does the parry 
none	 do  travis it uses your dex modifier plus the  laura sup dice he really wrote sup dice  matt yes you can to reduce the attack by your superiority dice plus your dexterity modifier yep  travis im going to try seven plus two nine  matt so you would take 37 points of slashing damage but instead you take nine away that would  be 28 so you get 28 points of slashing damage  travis im not raging  taliesin and you took 28 points  matt and you are pushed 15 feet away you are 
none	 now right off you get knocked over the side you get  knocked prone off onto the edge of the platform there almost catching yourself before rolling off  the side of the platform  liam its so exciting  matt scanlan that is a natural two thats a 16 to hit  sam it will hit but i will do my cutting words  matt okay so roll a d12  sam okay a d12 i rolled a nine  matt okay so that will miss you as it swings towards you what do you do  sam i 
none	 will quote dr smith again and i will yell at him you are a tiresome tinplated  tintinnabulation  matt the second construct youve bruised the ego of today i need you to make a constitution saving  throw grog  travis okay 18 with a minus two  matt 18 no your vision fades as the curse takes hold you are considered blinded at the moment  travis okay anybody else lights out for anyone else  matt and thats its turn vex youre up  travis no big deal  laura oh jeebies oh i can use disengage 
none	 so he doesnt hit me im going to move away from him  matt okay where do you move  laura all the way across over here  matt well your movement with your broom is how fast is your broom  laura i dont remember because i dont have the thing anymore  matt heavy sigh  laura i know matthew i think its 40 probably  matt broom of flying 50 feet  liam wow that was fast  matt look at that analog  laura 50 feet im writing it down right now okay  matt you 
none	 can get right over right above where percival is so thats your bonus action to  disengage your movement to get there what are you doing now  laura im going to attack him  matt go for it  laura that dice attacked me while i rolled it a 23  matt 23 misses  taliesin what  travis 23 misses  matt yeah you strike the armor on the side of its body and the arrow disintegrates on impact  you see bits of it catch flame from the nearby heat  laura oh lord okay i thought 
none	 because he was big maybe is he covered head to toe in armor  matt its made of solid stone with pieces of metal armor around the body  laura great okay so im going to attack him again but in his neck oh thats good that  probably hits 18 plus 14  matt thatll hit yeah  laura okay i didnt want to do the math counting do i get sneak attack  matt he is in base to base with your brother so yes  laura wait thats lightning one extra lightning damage and then nine sneak 
none	 attack  matt okay so the total on that is  laura 17 plus nine is 27  matt 26 yeah  laura plus one lightning damage so its 27  matt right there you go all right cool the first arrow shatters the second one you manage to  strike and it embeds itself in the stone and sticking out its hard to see if it had made much  of an impact that ends your turn and that brings us to scanlan  sam me oh jesus this things big and scary  matt youre on the top 
none	 of the staircase next to the water elemental and grog whos currently on  the ground screaming that hes blind the entity is about 15 feet away from you youre just out of  range of its blade and its an intimidating thing to have that close to you  sam yeah of course it is im not dumb super intimidating so how far is he from me  matt hes about 16 feet from you youre just out of range of the blade well no actually because  it did hit you so on the edge of there you 
none	 are within 15 feet of him yeah  sam okay not knowing what to do i will raspberry im looking at my spells ive got  nothing i will blast him with a lightning bolt a level three lightning bolt  matt level three lightning bolt okay so roll 8d6 points of damage  sam you know what ill do level four so 9d6 i suppose  matt all righty so that is a natural 20 so thats advantage on the saving throw however its  dexterity bonus is nothing its a straight 20 your spell dc  sam 22 
none	  matt 22 so it does not make the save  sam so its 34 points of damage  matt 34 points of lightning damage to it the bolt hits it and seems to arc through and its  faceless head slowly shifts to face you  sam jesus im within melee range of him so if i move i will get hit yes  matt if you move out of his melee range you will yes  sam okay  matt youll get attacked doesnt mean youll get hit  sam grog youre okay right  travis im blind 
none	 its very hot  sam what  travis its very hot on the ground and im blind  sam i dont know what to do about you im sorry ill inspire you i guess right because you  dont need health  travis yeah great thanks  sam laughs sorry all right ill inspire him i suppose  matt okay  sam sorry grog  travis what do you sing  sam oh sorry i will pick up my flute and i will sing singing you like it when my flute goes  baby make your booty glow scanlan know 
none	 you want to show my song song song song song  travis is that sisqó  matt take your d12 all righty thats your bonus your action and are you going to stay  where you are or are you going to move  sam yeah im going to stay where i am  matt okay ending that turn it comes to the elemental actually no at the end of scanlans  turn its going to go ahead and use a legendary action to make a rune blade strike against vax  whos right in front of him that is 
none	 a 22 to hit  liam and this is a straightup attack yeah i believe that hits yes it does  matt okay  liam wait ill use my last luck of the day on him and he has to reroll  matt okay  marisha wait  liam wait  matt that is a 19  liam and matt no  cheering  travis well done  matt so as the blade arcs overhead towards you you barely duck out of the way it slams on the  ground sending shards of stone and metal up in the air 
none	 around you you feel it rain over your  shoulder and the back of your head as you slowly pull away from it all righty now it is the  elementals turn  marisha okay its going to move over to him and hes bigger than large so hes going to do a  multiattack hes going to do two slam attacks plus seven to hit groans ones a natural one  the others a natural 18 so one hits 2d8 plus four bludgeoning damage  matt whats the attack 18 plus  marisha 18 plus seven  matt okay 
none	 so it would be 25 that hits are the creatures attacks considered magical  marisha theyre two bludgeoning attacks  matt nowhere on there does it say it does magical damage  marisha it just says bludgeoning damage  matt okay so as the elemental swings out both fists against it no effect none of its attacks  seem to have any effect or impact on the creature its like bludgeoning the side of a mountain  taliesin okay good to know  marisha and he doesnt seem to be distracted or give two shits about him  matt not

none	 hypersmith in the middle of battle  groaning  laura well okay do i have any more movement left  matt thats 15 minutes if its a straight multiple people helping circumstance  laura do i have any more movement left  matt not really you had to go over an arc to get there  taliesin you could grab the hammer  travis yeah but what purpose would it serve  taliesin i dont know maybe its a control hammer i dont know im grasping at fucking  straws here  matt vex  laura thats my last level 
none	 two that i cast  travis i could try  taliesin youve got actions  laura great so i dont have any more lesser restorations i can cast it at a higher level  maybe  marisha you also still have freedom of movement on you you dont have anything else at all i got  lost concentration but you do have freedom of movement  travis yeah  taliesin grabbing that hammer is definitely an option  laura i dont know why you would grab the hammer  travis maybe hed stop moving if i grabbed the hammer

none	  the chain up to grab the hammer  matt technically when youre holding your action to do something like an attack you can only do  that because its a reaction a very quick thing basically as soon as you get your vision youre  like panting  travis i will rage and thats it  matt ill let you rage on that sure  marisha can he attack the elemental thats now rogue across from him  matt hes not within range unfortunately its across the way  travis can i turn around and look now that im

none	 to one  taliesin the rest are other tools  marisha do i take my planetars constitution  matt yes thats plus seven  marisha thats cool but then i still have my war caster ability too right i have advantage  matt no thats against concentration so you will have to do that in a second but first this  is to see if you go blind or not this is a curse effect  travis dont they have truesight and stuff  marisha i do have truesight as a planetar it is pretty good so thats 27  
none	 matt 27 okay you resist the blindness however now half that damage  marisha you said 42  matt so half of that is 21 so dc 21 make a constitution saving throw with advantage  taliesin with a d4  marisha im good 17 plus my constitution  matt yeah youre fine so you maintain concentration on your form perfect that finishes  keyleths turn grog what are you doing  travis yeah its hammer time im going to run down here five ten 15 right there to this side  matt perfect you can get up right against

none	 turn lets see if he gets the blade storm  back does he does get the blade storm back so hes going to leap and land up here in the center  oh god  laura singing bigbys hand  taliesin oh that also means he takes his bleed damage this turn  matt it does yeah so were going to go ahead and put this over here  liam can anybody do an attack of opportunity  travis i do  liam and then can i get an attack of opportunity even though im holding i have no idea 
none	  matt you will yes  taliesin im so excited by how youre doing this here this is some crazy shit  laura its the sword it throws him off balance  marisha hes been doing his yogas though  matt so takes another 24 damage all righty both you guys get attacks of opportunity  travis reckless great weapon master 30  matt hits  travis okay for 30 points of damage  matt crash it takes the hit it lands go ahead and make your attack  liam okay so i had him flanked with grog right because

none	 it  liam can i see now  matt you can now see  liam so now i can do my held turn  matt yes you can  liam am i within ten feet ill move forward a bit  matt well you held your action not your turn theres a difference  liam okay but hes near  matt i will say the minute you hit him and the vision comes back ill allow you to do it  liam well wait is he within ten feet of grog would you say his foot  matt sure ill 
none	 let it happen  liam well im going to save it then  laura no he said you were in range he was in range right when you moved  liam i understand that im weighing multiple options dear no i will cast vow of enmity ill  cast it on my bonus action then attack attack  matt you held your action as vow of enmity  liam to attack right to attack which was to cast vow of enmity and not to attack as well  matt you cant hold your whole turn you hold an action  
none	 liam vow of enmity  matt so as it lands there it uses blade storm crash strikes around as it sweeps everyone in a  15foot radius which will be grog vax vex the elemental and scanlan  laura aw he can even get scanlan but hes so little  sam am i still holding on to his sword  matt with bigby you are so disadvantage on all these attacks correct so against scanlan that  is hah avoided a natural 20 because of that so that instead is going to be a 22  sam that hits  
none	 matt all righty against vax is a 29  liam scoffs yeah  matt all right against grog that is a 21  travis yep  matt and against vex is a 24  laura ooh that hits and the elemental  matt elemental is an 18  marisha hits armor class 14  matt yeah all right so each of you suffers 44 points of slashing damage  laura im going to uncanny dodge  matt okay so 22  liam and ive already used my uncanny dodge in this round i think  matt yes because when he 
dung	 took his turn you did  liam yeah so mine is 44 for me  matt 44 to the elemental youll want to keep track of that  marisha yep im on it  matt and then 22 to you and i need all of you to make constitution saving throws  travis come on baby  matt the elemental fails  taliesin its a blind elemental  marisha nope it can be blinded hes got 70 hit points he hasnt taken any more damage correct  laura oh no ugh  marisha whos blind  laura im blind

none	 those are your shots  taliesin and im running towards that fire pit straight back  matt this way youre going to have to leap over lava  taliesin i cant whirl around it  matt if you want to go around it you can go counting  taliesin thatll do  matt all right there you go all right that ends percivals turn death saving throw with  advantage  liam good natural 20  matt youre fine actually you stabilize youre fine end of your turn its now the forge  guardians turn  taliesin is he blind 
none	 is he still blind  matt well hes not conscious and currently you are still blind yeah  liam am i at zero hit points and stable or one hit point and stable  matt zero hit points and stable  liam love it  travis one hit point zero is unconscious  matt you dont have to make the death saving throws anymore  laura oh but youre still unconscious  matt no you regain one hit point if you roll a 20 youre right  liam but were not at the top of the round right were still 
none	 midround correct  matt correct so youre conscious now though your vision you open your eyes and theres still  darkness but youre conscious all right the forge guardian does not regain his blade storm  hes going to make two melee attacks against you grog since youve given him the option actually  hes going to go ahead and leap a little bit to land here not enough to give you an attack of  opportunity its going to make one strike at you grog and another kick attack at scanlan  liam kick a gnome  taliesin gnomekicking 
none	 is a timehonored tradition  matt 31 grog  travis yeah that hits ill take the retaliation after as well  matt 34 points of slashing damage down to 17 and scanlan that is 28 to hit  sam that hits  matt you take 24 points of bludgeoning damage  sam i will reduce that with cutting words  marisha hes about to go down isnt he  matt all right so reduced so roll a d12 this is your last bardic inspiration so youre done  with this now  sam d12 six  matt okay so take 
none	 six damage off of that  sam what was the damage i dont think you said  matt i thought i did but i dont remember  sam you rolled a 20something to hit but i dont think you said damage  matt thats fine i cant remember okay counting 25 points reduced so you take 19  points of bludgeoning damage as it kicks you and you are pushed 15 feet back  liam and marisha past the lava  travis skipping across  marisha please tell me youre not unconscious  matt so scanlan you immediately are kicked 
none	 back into the molten rock and iron that is 61 points  of fire damage  laura did he go under tell me youre not unconscious  sam im unconscious  matt scanlan is now on fire and sizzling hes t800ing  travis can i take my retaliation attack  matt you can  travis reckless great weapon master  laura i think i can get him out  travis 34 minus five 29  matt that hits roll damage on that  travis 23 33  matt 33 damage by the way at the top of its turn it 
none	 also took 17 points of damage from your  hemorrhaging shot its looking rough now its looking pretty rough all right so that finishes  that turn end of his turn vex youre up  laura yeah okay all right can i get to scanlan from my position on the map  liam movement dash action to grab him  laura all right then im going to pick him up  matt all right so you glide down and you grab his body and you lift him up and you get him out  of the lava but thats as 
none	 much movement as youve got  laura can i use my action to  matt its your action to grab and pull him out  laura can i use my bonus action to dash away  matt you can ill say you move half speed because youre having to bring him with you  laura okay im going to back up  matt so you can get both of you guys back up to wherever you want to go  laura into the corner  matt into the corner so you get about there  laura at least i got 
none	 him out of the lava  liam i have had a jackrabbit knee under the table for ten minutes  laura but thats it thats everything  matt all right so that ends vexs turn top of the round scanlan you immediately take fire  damage because youre still on fire so you immediately fail a death saving throw  sam but i have some sort of death ward on me  matt you do have death ward on you so as you go and reach and grab him and pull him up the death  ward flickers on and 
none	 he comes back to one hit point you pull him off to the side as soon as  his turn comes up he takes seven points of fire damage and now goes to zero  marisha he didnt fail a death saving throw  matt the death ward has expired  liam point of clarification were at the top of the round so i just went from one hit point to two hit points  matt yeah i think so actually well its the top of your turn so yeah let me double check on that  liam safe at 
none	 two no one can touch me  travis yeah youre all good  matt all righty so that brings us from scanlans turn to the elementals turn the elemental is  going to go ahead and whoosh  sam this overlay things pretty cool  liam yeah right it makes remote play not quite as removed  sam can we have a hologram version of that in front of us all the time  travis yeah right here  marisha yeah counting our hit points for us  sam that we can see i mean  matt that is 13 
none	 against your armor class does not hit and 14 does not hit it has the blindness  on the elemental still  travis super cute elemental chasing me like a puppy  matt ending that elementals turn it is now grog and keyleths turn  travis ill go turn straight at him reckless great weapon master  matt all righty  travis thats going to be enough come on crit no okay  matt technically sorry before we get to that at the end of its turn at the end of the  elementals turn its going to go ahead 
none	 and strike you with its blade  travis okay im going to keep that roll just in case something happens  matt no worries thats a 27 to hit  travis which it does  matt 36 points of slashing damage reduced to half so thats 18 and make a constitution saving  throw please  marisha i have four as my planetar so ive got two more of those that i just did in terms of  myself im trying to keep tabs  travis 24  matt 24 yeah you resist the blindness so your turn unabated as 
none	 you were before  travis right minus five is 31 to hit  matt yeah that hits  travis it was a great roll and the second one is pretty big 34 minus five is 29  matt that hits yeah both do damage  liam let me do a little roleplay here oh baby  travis 17 plus ten is 27 for the first one oh nope im sorry that was a one so im going to  reroll it five 21 31 for the first one second one three 29 and my fucking necrotic dice two  four 
none	 more  matt all right that ends your turn grog  travis that does actually can i move im going to stay in melee but i want to come over here in  case he decides to golfswing me into the fucking lava river  matt sure its going to use its second legendary action to attack you as soon as you move around  its going to sweep low and attempt to try and cleave you in half with the advantage against  you natural 20  screaming  taliesin knock it off  matt that reckless attack man 
none	 he gets advantage on all his attacks against him  travis thats the reason i roll so high most of the time  marisha yeah you kill them before they can retaliate  matt 73 points of slashing damage on 3d12 it was a ten eight and a 12  marisha what was it 76  travis so thats 37  matt its 20 30 times two 60 plus 13 so 73 so half of that would be 36 well say 36 points  of slashing damage and make a constitution saving throw  taliesin god fucking damn it  
none	 travis yeah 24  matt 24 okay resisting it still  travis i can still see  matt yeah you can still see all right keyleth  marisha okay you can still see everyones good youre up everyones up  laura scanlans dead unconscious  marisha youre with him hes fine im going to fly over 120 feet ive got a fivefoot reach  range im going to do my multiattack as my planetar so two hits with plus two im going to  do gil  liam come on captain planet  travis we just had three fights in 
none	 the same day  marisha goddamn thats a natural 19 on one and a natural 16 on the other plus 12 for both of those  matt yeah those both hit  marisha okay and then for both of those 4d6 plus seven and an additional 5d8 radiant damage  matt correct  liam kiki its yours  laura kill it  marisha okay for the d6s alone okay thats six plus four thats ten plus another five 15 plus  three is 18  matt 18 plus seven 25  marisha im just doing the d6s 25 and then 
none	 not as great the second time  taliesin do you reroll those  marisha no not for this only elemental damage so five six seven plus another seven  so 14  matt 14 okay and then now 10d8 radiant damage  marisha now 10d8 radiant damage i may just roll these twice okay so the first one okay ten  plus seven so 17 plus another seven is 24 radiant and then counting 19 damage radiant  damage  matt how do you want to do this  shouting  matt as you rush across the room rushing towards 
none	 it and strike out towards it what do you want to do  marisha okay grunts as i look around see all my friends blind and running around insane im  going to go yells and fly across the field and come down with a big radiant strike and try and  invoke in the back of my head singing hallelujah and grunts  matt as you arc down with your weapon the holy divine energy spraying off of the strike the  arc slams into the center of the guardians chest and you watch as the armor expands and 
none	 explodes  you see this core in the center that previously has been guarded by its stone form and there on  the inside you see this beating red gem that powerdown sound goes cold as it does the  guardian drops the blade footsteps and walks to the other side of the chamber pieces of its armor  falling off to the ground you see cracked parts of its outer form breaking off in small chunks of  shale and it makes its way to the opposite side walking around carefully each of you it takes  and places 
none	 its blade crashing up on this stand on the wall turns around and goes completely  inert  laura whoa it was a trial you had to be able to beat him in order to forge here im putting  scanlan out because hes still on fire  matt okay scanlan is still on fire  laura scanlan is not on fire anymore  travis is he unconscious still  laura hes still unconscious so im going to cast cure wounds at level one because thats what i  can do so im going to cast cure wounds on him 
none	 to bring him back to life  marisha okay and then i fly over whoosh and do my other healing touch on vax  matt how many healing touches does he have  marisha four  liam wait i dont need it wait  laura so six points scanlan thats what youve got  liam the massive gash across my entire body as you stand there for 30 seconds starts to close  marisha cool whoosh i go over to scanlan and do a healing touch 6d8 counting can you give  me one more d8 okay scanlan you have 
none	 14 15 26 you heal 26 plus three so 29 hit points  sam thank you  marisha and youre cured from any diseases is anyone else blind or rough  liam thats gone as soon as hes done fighting  matt yes the blindness has faded  marisha i have one more of these if anyone else needs healing  travis im in double digits which is uncomfortable for me  laura yeah youre low double digits too  marisha youre low double digits whoosh  matt where are you at  travis 53  marisha i drop same 
none	 thing into grog  travis yeah i got my ass handed to me two crits by that giant bastard  matt that reckless man thats the downside  travis i know ill take though its worth the gamble  marisha counting you get 37 hit points  matt the first part of this fight he was sucking it was like two three three two and  then he picked up all righty so in the silence as you guys take a moment to breathe and recover  the uncomfortable heat in here is sweltering the guardian is motionless across the 
none	 forge the blade  is set up against the wall now obscured by the smoke thats still billowing up across the back  wall getting a better glance around you can see a lot of the soot and black that has gathered in  the upper areas of the ceiling which is about 50 feet high there you see faintly glowing and  obscuring the air above it the core anvil the chains still held taut as the various  blacksmithing implements hang dangling off the sides of the central platform  travis well that was a bitch what do 
none	 you say we cut to the chase and hammer this shit out  laura i hope he wont come back to life as soon as we start  marisha is my elemental still going rogue  matt i will say at this point because the elemental took quite a bit of damage that you  guys quickly dispatch it i dont want to have to worry about you guys killing a blind elemental  its fine no longer blind but still splat its gone  marisha keyleth goes mickey in fantasia for a second and shes the axe to the 
none	 brooms killing  my creation  travis theres a big splash up against the wall but its just water  taliesin sam your inspiration is a long rest recharge not a short rest right  matt short rest  taliesin oh if we take a short rest he can inspire us when we do this  laura yeah we should probably if we can take a short rest  liam thats a half hour yeah that was hard  taliesin i want to sit down  laura just so you guys can think about your process know exactly what youre 
none	 doing  taliesin we do need to discuss this  matt while you guys are taking a short rest you can heal up with your hit dice i also need  everyone to make a constitution saving throw please because its so hot in here  liam do i with the fire on the deathwalkers ward  marisha yeah and me with the mantle  matt this is a little more than the usual mantle ill say you have to make it as well vax just  make it with advantage  marisha do i get with advantage because of 
none	 the mantle or no  taliesin 18  travis 21  laura 19  liam 25  marisha 14  laura scanlan  sam i rolled that poop thing again  matt so both scanlan and keyleth gain a point of exhaustion  sam wait do i get advantage no i dont know  matt you do not  laura you got a lot of hit dice that you can roll  travis i do but still four  matt your constitution modifier is  travis five  taliesin and now im up to top again and it only took 
none	 two hit dice and then i get my heal back i  get my action surges back grit comes back on a short rest  laura im back to 144  liam back at the temporary 137 due to the feast  taliesin im going to really quickly fix bad news all right i fixed bad news  matt there you go  taliesin wow and so many things dont work anymore okay yeah  matt whats wrong now  taliesin oh my hex is burned my spider climbs burned diplomacy is a long rest before that goes  again 
none	  matt so you guys finish your short rest what do you want to do in the chamber you have the whole  chamber at your disposal  travis i would like to go to the top where the core anvil is and start pulling up each of the  tools that are hanging by the four chains  matt okay you find numerous sets of tongs you find twisting tools you find metal punches you  find chisels of all sizes you see a form of leg vise thats laying at the side of the anvil which  you 
dung	 know immediately weirdly for you a leg vise is a small device that you use to clamp metal onto  the anvil to work on it you use your foot to hold down with pressure you also see the hammer that  was chained to it as well which is very well made the dark black hammer metal look with gold  inlay it looks like scrolling all across it in places all these different tools are all chained  to the actual sides of the anvil  travis can i tell what material the black part of the hammer 
none	 is made out of if its rock metal  some sort of volcanic glass  matt it appears to be metal  laura so these trammels need to be made out of platinum you know how to do it right  taliesin no i know how to do it  laura okay so what do we do  travis i have the chunks of platinum i hand the chunks of platinum over to percy to put the i  guess they dont have to be in  taliesin were going to have to smelt them  laura theyre going to 
dung	 be melted  travis so we should do that right  taliesin were going to have to start with smelting them well i dont know you know the  process i dont why am i in character talking to the dungeon master whats happening ah the  meta  matt you understand based on the discussion you guys had between the design the platinum has to  be smelted down into workable bars ingots of metal that can be hammered and folded you have to  get into the chamber to do so because the smelting materials are in the 
none	 chamber you just came from  this is the forging chamber the other doors are still closed once theyre made into bars and  this is from the design that you recall ioun gave you the beads of divinity that youve been given  you have to actually shatter across the anvil and then fold the pieces into the metal  travis cool  matt once thats done then you actually have a solid blank of platinum inlaid with the fragments  of divinity you then have to draw out the trammel tips which makes them into a fine point 
none	 like a  long javelinlike rod then you have to use the vise after heating the metal to twist the  trammels the actual design has them twisted because it helps conduct the divine energy to the  point and then using the chiseling tools you have to work in the runes that match and channel  the incantation that scanlans book has its a multiprocess step thats going to require both of  you to work together on this since some elements of it are blacksmithing elements some of it are  tinkering  laura so we have to 
none	 get into the other room first before we do any of that can i fly over and see  if i can find any kind of apparatus that would  matt make a perception check  liam going with her to do the same investigation  laura 30  matt so 30 you glance up and you see it looks there like there were two chains that were  originally down held on a crank device however the chain has been cut and the other half of it is  about 20 feet up in the air  laura okay 
none	 and im assuming that im not strong enough to pull on that chain right i can try  im going to try  liam why dont you and i try  laura yeah but you cant fly anymore  marisha i can though i still have wings  laura you fly on one and ill try to get the other one  marisha yeah  matt so planetar form go ahead and make a strength check please  marisha i am looking right now my strength is 24 so plus seven scoffs again why again with  the threes  
none	 taliesin put that one away  marisha ten  laura oh i rolled a 13  matt you two tug on those chains and they are not moving  laura can the guardian do it hey you that was attacking us can you get those chains  matt make a persuasion check  laura laughs really yeah it wasnt a very persuasive thing to say 14  matt 14 it makes no motion change nothing  liam shorthalt you got any bigbys left in you  sam i could do one if we really need it whats wrong with grog 
none	 he cant do it  laura its too high  liam he could do one we could get him up there  marisha is the end of the chain able to where i can pull to at least make it reach grog or no  matt no you dont have the strength to pull it down not with that strength check unfortunately  liam can you bigby one and maybe vex can slowly pull grog up to that thing on your broom  laura or she could probably lift grog up  marisha can i fly grog up  matt 
none	 yeah you can lift him up grunts it takes you a minute and its a slow pull you feel the  veins bulging on your blueskinned forehead grunts  travis kicking my feet which doesnt make it any easier  marisha dogpaddling  matt but you do get up grog and you grab the chain make a strength check  travis im not still raging unfortunately  matt you can still be raging if you want to  laura youre very angry about it  travis 23  matt as you lift him up you grab the chain and rappelling 
none	 down you begin to find places in the  stonework and metal on the side and hold on with your other hand pull as you do you watch the  wall on the opposite side scraping move up on one side a little bit and get stuck  sam should i bigby the other  laura yeah  sam all right ill have to do it at level seven  marisha oh shit were so tapped out  matt so bigbys hand appears whoosh rushes up to the other chain go ahead and make a d20 roll  and add 
none	 an eight to it  sam 21  matt as bigby pulls the other side the wall on the opposite side adjusts and both chains now  grog and bigbys hand together pull and pull and pull and slowly as youre both pulling across the  metal and dragging it downward the opposite wall scraping opens up  sam oh wait is this an ability check  matt yeah  sam im exhausted  taliesin bigby isnt though  matt bigby isnt its a check for the spell not for you so together you both eventually bring the  chains 
none	 to the bottom and you find one of the number of hooks on the floor area where you can  wrap it around to hold it in place its tenuous but its holding and so the large metal door on  the opposite side is currently now held up about 13 feet up its only partway up right now but thats  all you need at the moment  marisha can grog and them let go is it going to slam shut  matt they found large rings and hooks to hook them onto  travis we hurry to the 
none	 other room  taliesin we hurry to the other room if we can get any inspiration too before we start this  process  laura theres no inspiration oh no he rested yeah  matt short rest so he has his inspiration back  taliesin lets just smelt for now  marisha and now i can do my concentration let me burn another spell im doing cats grace on you  that fell to the wayside before  matt you have advantage on dexteritybased ability checks  travis oh thats right thats the one thank you  matt so lets 
none	 see here grog percival you head to the original chamber before this you find the  tongs and some of the metallic ingotbased molds you take in pieces of platinum equal to the  amounts you guys had pulled up before how much was it  laura 300 platinum each  matt that was for the face for the trammels  laura oh would those little pyramids work to make the trammels or it needs more  matt well no theres other molds there with the smelting device  laura i got 4920 platinum  matt if i recall it 
none	 was 1500 platinum per piece i believe  travis so 4500 so enough for three trammels  matt so you guys made the platinum transition when you were in vasselheim and the reason it  takes so much is because even the natural platinum thats out there has some impurities in the  process of the creating so you guys have to repeatedly go through and burn and pull out impure  segments of the metals that come to the top  laura make sure you use some of those pyramids we made though  marisha yeah so we dont 
none	 waste that platinum that we melted into triangles  matt so grog i need you to go ahead and make a blacksmithing tool check this is with proficiency  bonus it should be dexterity for this  taliesin at which you have advantage  travis which i have advantage  matt correct so youd roll twice  laura 1500 per trammel of platinum okay were fine yeah can you get your calculator out never  mind i can do this it myself  taliesin yeah figure out what dex plus proficiency whatever your dex plus prof is  travis oh 
none	 advantage right i got it 19  sam oh do you want me to inspire you or anything do you all need anything  taliesin how long does inspiration last for  matt up to ten minutes  taliesin lets wait until the final  matt all right so it takes you a good 20 minutes or so 30 minutes or so per ingot to get  all the impurities out to heat it and to scoop it out eventually gets so you can form three bars of pure  platinum to the level that you know the requirements of 
none	 the trammel are you look around you dont see  any areas here to cool the metal you didnt get a good look at the other chamber necessarily to see  if there was something for it  travis i still have the alchemy jug with the water in it  laura you might shatter that jug  taliesin theres probably everything we need in here if we take a look around  marisha do you need water  taliesin were going to need water  laura can i fly around and see what we can see  matt sure 
none	 you glance around and theres the two machines over there that are still crashing  behind and in the center of the two machines you do see a trough about eight feet on one side and  three feet the width of it it is empty however  marisha i go over and cast create water  matt you manage to fill the trough brimming with cool instantly created water  laura weve got a trough  matt back and forth you guys take the molds with tongs and sizzling quench the metal and pull out  the three heavy 
none	 platinum ingots ready for use on the actual anvil  liam this just turned into an aerosmith video  matt laughter so now that youre working on the forge you have your gauntlets on the two of  you walk up and you have all these tools around you to fold the metal youre going to need the  hammer so you grab the hammer and the hammers pretty big its like a maul its a twohanded  hammer  travis i love this  matt you need the beads of divinity for this next stage  travis whos got 
none	 the beads  laura and sam ive got a bead  matt so you take the ioun one which has a faint whitishgray glow and place it in the center of  the anvil go ahead and make a strength check grog  travis can i go into a rage  matt you may  travis heavy breathing thats even better 25  matt 25 with a giant echoing yell grunts you bring the hammer down and you watch a flash of  bright vibrant white faintly blue light flicker and beam across the room all of you for a 
none	 second  have to hold your eyes and look away and as you come back the hammer is on top of the anvil as  you pull it back you see where the bead was there is now a crushed dust of the same color roughly  about the size of a plate none of its scattered away from the anvil it is a crystalline  diamondlike powder that remains  travis do we fold this into one of the ingots one at a time  taliesin one at a time  matt all right so with you holding the 
none	 tongs and helping him you take the hammer i need you to  make a blacksmithing tool check  taliesin with advantage  matt this is with strength on this one this is hammering the metal and folding it into the  metal  travis that is a 19  matt 19s fine the hammering isnt too hard the different things have different difficulties and  so the folding isnt too bad so with that you guys take the dust and you scatter it across the  metal and then hammer and fold hammer and fold and take more and 
none	 scatter it across the metal as  its still heated hammer and fold then go and take it off to the side to two of the coal areas  and you watch as the furnaces burn and heat the metal up again you bring it back up to the steps  and hammer and fold hammer and fold with more of it until eventually youve managed to hammer in  over the next 20 or so minutes both of you sweating feeling a little bit of stiffness and  soreness in your arms from this process but youve been far 
none	 worse  laura were cheering them on the side good forging fold that metal  matt you eventually build a rod blank for your first trammel using the bead of divinity from  ioun that is complete so whos next  travis whose bead is up next  laura oh god all right here we go  matt all right so you take the faintly yellowishglowing bead of divinity from the  dawnfather place it onto the anvil make another strength check please  laura does he need inspiration  travis persistent rage im raging balls this whole time  
none	 matt do you still have an inspiration on you right now  travis i do not  laura scanlan  sam do you want me to inspire you  travis and laura yeah  sam all right i will i go up to grog and i tell him grog im going to tell you some words of  wisdom that i learned from a book once a wise man said the man who hast smelted verily didst also  dealt it  travis wisdom unparalleled wisdom  matt so with advantage and youre still raging on this  travis oh 
none	 thats amazing yeah 25  matt 25 again  travis 17 plus eight  matt both times youve hit 25 and the dc on this is 25 on the sheet here so with pelors bead of  divinity you crash slam down a second time this time you guys see a flash like you stare  into the sun for a split second the heat in the room grows even warmer for a moment and its like  being on the outside of a meteor swarm blast which you all recall very distinctly you come  back and pull the 
none	 hammer away and there you see the scattering dust of the dawnfathers blessed  bead  the two of you then go ahead and take in the next ingot and begin you heat it up bring it back to  the anvil and begin to fold scatter fold scatter reheat bring back fold scatter  repeating the process until you get all through it i need you to go ahead and make another  blacksmithing tool check  travis advantage because of the cats grace its a 19  matt this is strength still  travis oh it is  
none	 matt yeah ill tell you if its dex or strength because youre hammering the metal hes turning  it over  travis 27  matt 27 yeah without an issue you guys manage to fold in your second trammel blank without  worry bringing you to the third one the third and final  travis bead  matt producing and placing onto the anvil vax you leave behind there the small jet black smooth  oval bead  travis i reach into my pouch and i take out one of my peas that i got and i put it on 
none	 the anvil  laura dont do it get it off of there grog  matt strength check grog  travis raging strength check okay its inspiration time  sam inspiration time  travis im going to use the dice  marisha because you didnt use it before  laura no he hasnt used it gasps  travis its a 24  matt 24 clang you slam down and you pull back the hammer and there it remains unshattered  laura try it again  travis but my arms are really sore i need a massage  laura im going to 
dung	 over and rub his muscles  liam grog if you do this i will give you something really cool really cool  travis by whose standards yours or mine  liam yours  travis all right  laura do you want to inspire him again scanlan  sam yes i do i will sing to him singing pour some platinum on thee and get it on an anvil pour  some platinum on thee when you need a trammel  matt take your d12 all right grog as you try again pulling the large maul hammer up  travis no 
none	 come on gil thats dog shit  laura oh no  travis im not even going to use the inspiration because it wont get us there  laura try one more time can he try again  travis well now hold on i would have to roll a 12 of a d12  sam youd have to roll a 12  laura try it though  matt its up to you  travis ten  laura oh motherfuck  matt impact you slam down with a second hit as it hits the reverberation of the impact fills the  room 
none	 you pull the hammer back and there it remains but you do see a mild crack through its  form  travis panting ill try one more time one more no inspiration  marisha can i do anything to help him  taliesin no lets just do it  marisha can i give him guidance  laura do you get any more inspiration scanlan  sam sure yeah i can inspire one more time  travis hold on let me try it without the inspiration let me try  matt if you give him guidance it will give him an 
none	 additional d4 he gets to add  marisha but it would get rid of his cats grace but youre not using it  matt oh yeah because its concentration  travis let me do it straight up  marisha its a cantrip im going to give you guidance im doing it guidance  matt so as youre doing this keyleth comes up behind and then touches you  marisha come on grog come on thats my guidance  travis i didnt need it 25 on the dot  marisha good  matt what could have been only two trammels you 
none	 barely manage to succeed in properly shattering  and not ruining the third bead impact as you slam all of you for a second see nothing but  darkness all the light all the flame even the heat of the room goes jet cold for an instant and  all of a sudden the light of the furnaces flicker back on the machine once more crushing the  engine slams and light filters back you pull the hammer back you see a scattering of darkened  coal obsidian dust remaining behind  travis ive never been so happy to see 
none	 a 17 before oh my god  liam work that playdoh come on  matt with that you two holding the tongs you take and fold the metal hammer it fold the  metal hammer it make another blacksmithing check go ahead and make your final blank  laura okay but now you can add things  travis ive got advantage is it strength or dex  matt this is strength still this one  marisha you still have guidance  travis but i get a d4 on top of it oh thats great 26 without the other stuff  
none	 matt without an issue so with that you fold and you have your three finished trammel blanks each  one infused with the bead of divinity now you need to draw them out and you can do these as one  check for the three of them so you go in and you take these blanks these long rods and you heat  up the tip and bring it back you holding with the tongs you begin to at an angle hammering it  against the top of the anvil to eventually bring it to a gradual point i need 
none	 you to go ahead and  make a blacksmithing check this will be dexterity because this is less of just hammering this is a  little more careful manipulation of the metal did you cast cats grace on him again because if you  dont its not advantage  marisha cats grace  travis then ill keep that and then what was the guidance do i have guidance any more  matt no you cant have both  marisha do you want advantage or do you want that extra d4  taliesin advantage  laura so he can still add 
none	 one d4 on this  marisha pick one  travis its a 15 with advantage  matt its a 15  sam shall i inspire him  matt well you have to inspire him before he makes the check  travis because its my dexterity modifier plus my proficiency bonus right  matt yes  taliesin can i help with this  matt you are helping with this  taliesin oh god okay  matt laughs well get to you shortly so as you begin to hammer it out its getting a little  fragile at some points ill let 
none	 you make one more check so you dont ruin one of the trammels  travis advantage right  taliesin advantage and inspiration  sam sure yeah ill inspire him again  laura he needs as much as you can give him scanlan  sam i will give him every inch of myself  laura so one  laughter  sam one by one by one yeah  travis my god thats better okay thats a 24 should i use the inspiration  sam yes you should  travis 29  matt 29 so this time seeing where the imperfections were 
none	 in the hammering you initially  did and curving and bringing fragility to one of the trammels you double back heat up and  correct the mistake over the next ten minutes or so you both carefully work to bring each to a  razor point at the end of these large platinum javelins now theyre thicker on one side and come  to an impossible point at the other you have three of these base trammels now complete  laura now we got to twist them  travis no we got to put the runes in  matt so 
none	 now you have to twist them this is where you bring up the leg vice so you go ahead and you  clamp it in there this is without your help this is now you taking and heating the metal and  twisting it as you go so make another blacksmithing check  marisha i can guide you i can do nothing else  matt this is a dexteritybased  marisha oh its dexterity still then keep the advantage you have advantage  travis sobbing im tired of this  laura does he have any more inspiration  sam sure 
none	 i can inspire him  laura wait keep inspiring  taliesin he already rolled  laura but he hasnt announced it  matt he already rolled  travis its a 26 its okay  matt so with that you one by one slowly using the clamp twist heat it up grab clamp twist  hammer twist and continue this process for each trammel as everyone looks on with bated breath  the deafening sound of the enginelike contraptions fill the space like a heartbeat  their rhythm gets into your muscles and the aches begin to fade as you focus 
none	 on the hammers in  unison with the slamming becomes this very primal forgingoftheworld vision to see grog  atop this anvil for over an hour at this point now sweating and hammering away at these  trammels a vision of the allhammer once long ago forging weapons of old longforgotten and  lost now grog sits here forging the means of sealing one of the biggest threats to the prime  material plane by himself as you finish twisting the final trammel you pull it up sizzling  quenching them in the water that you left behind and as 
none	 you pull up you can see as the steam  rises the three twisted javelins of pure platinum ready for the final scrolling  travis panting okay okay give me the cool thing  liam i dont want to do that with everybody here im not lying to you its really cool  travis im too tired to be upset about it  liam later i promise  marisha what do you  taliesin well lets see what do i have to do  matt the only hammer here is that maul but all the chiseling and tinkering work takes 
none	 a much  smaller more delicate hammer  travis i do have the dwarven thrower  matt its going to have to be a smaller edge than that  laura like what whisper  liam edge yeah  matt it has to be a hammer  marisha like a rock hammer  laura can we look around for a little teeny hammer  matt make an investigation check  sam teeny hammer  laura 12 for me so probably not so much  taliesin make an investigation check  travis me too  liam 18 for me  taliesin glad 
none	 i got that roll out of the way  travis 15  matt looking around all the other tools are for different things but theres no other hammer  theres the one singular giant hammer on the chain  laura have you picked it up maybe it changes shape  taliesin im going to try picking the hammer up  matt okay you pick up the hammer  taliesin im going to try and attune to it  matt so you take a bit of time to attune with it if you feel thats something you could try  taliesin 
none	 im going to examine it  matt okay make an arcana check  taliesin make another arcana check lets see what happens oh thats better 21  matt 21 this is definitely an enchanted hammer you take time with it and focus and once you feel  the essence of attunement begin to drift into this hammer you unattune from one of your other items  and you will it the hammer actually shrinking shrinks down into a small light hammer ballpeen  hammer  travis smart move  taliesin ill drop animus for now  marisha your coffeestained artifacts 
none	  liam i dropped my travel mug  matt so now with this tinier hammer in your grasp you walk over and put the trammels on the  anvil you grab some of the chiseling implements and the two of you together begin to work and  youre mainly there taking the hammer and driving the back of the chisel while hes guiding the  design because you dont know what vision he has so youve done all the groundwork youve built  the structure the base plate for it but you have all the intricate designs in the head 
none	 that ioun  imparted with you so now you almost go into a trance with the chiseling tools and you have three  in your hands and youre juggling them behind and youre staring ahead its really weird to watch  percival go from this focused individual to staring off into space and his hands take over and  begins moving the chisels along each one of them almost too fast for you to keep up and you get to  the point where youre like rapid hammering trying to keep up with him as hes moving along  as 
none	 you do you watch as this intricate scrolling begins to appear and dig itself into the side of  each trammel he rotates it with the tongs moves into place gets the chisel and removes it  rotates it again and as this continues it gets faster and faster and faster i need you to go  ahead to make a tinkering check  marisha do you want any guidance  tailesin oh ill take anything i can get  laura cats grace is what dexterity  taliesin well technically thats a dex check so if you have cats grace 
none	 ill take it  marisha is it a dex check  matt its what you gave to grog earlier  marisha okay then i will give you cats grace at third level because my 2ndlevel spells are tapped  and so are now my 3rdlevel spells nothing more  taliesin if you have any inspiration ill also take it  sam yes sure ill give you some i will sing to you i will sing singing bang bang percys ballpeen  hammer goes down upon the ground bang bang percys ballpeen hammer makes a really really  big sound vocalizing 
none	  matt the actual heat from the core anvil is enough that when you hold the trammel against it  it gives it just enough of a malleable edge for you to go ahead and chisel through it without  issue as youre going its three checks one for each trammel so the first one  taliesin thats without inspiration thats 31  matt 31 skittering clanging after about five minutes or so you finish and grab one of the  trammels and clang onto the ground begin on the other skittering  travis slow down  taliesin and marisha 
none	 groan  marisha try again inspiration it  taliesin i might be able to inspiration this because that was a really bad roll both of them  are the same both of them are two and this is not one of those things where i can fix its  either good or its bad  laura we might be able to fix it  taliesin im going to try and add a little bit of inspiration maybe  marisha groans  taliesin thats not very good thats 17  matt 17 okay the second trammel as youre chiseling along you 
none	 feel as the metal cracking  begins to bend and snap in one place its still one piece sighs the dc has gone up but you get  one more shot at that one  taliesin can i get one more inspiration if you got any are you out  sam ive used five and i think i get six  taliesin lets take another one just in case because jesus fucking christ  matt the dc was 20 now its 25  taliesin okay  matt if this fails its going to break a trammel  laura oh my 
none	 god  taliesin please i will happily take that inspiration please  sam all right i will inspire you with some bullshit  marisha no one has any other type of guidance or anything  laura im looking ive got nothing  travis i dont have anything i just hit things  taliesin its a skill check its not a save oh wait i dont get to add anything from the hammer  for this  matt no the hammer is allowing the process to take place  liam do we need to do this right now can we take 
none	 nappies and come back  taliesin i think it has to be soft right  liam you would have a whole other batch of inspirations in the morning  sam yeah but hes got one more shot at this  taliesin i think we have to do it now right  matt the trance is there its up to you  taliesin give me one more inspiration if you can and well see where we go  sam i will sing one more song to inspire you ill sing singing heres a little song i wrote its  filled with 
none	 inspiration note for note dont fuck up or ill kill you  laughter  matt all righty  taliesin i dont feel good  travis one at a time  taliesin thatll do 18 28 30  matt 30  travis and we have the inspiration for the third one  matt you managed to complete the scrolling on the trammel the trammel is still noticeably fragile  but it seems functional the enchantment will be channeled so second trammels done final check  on the third and final trammel  travis come on jesus  marisha this is so 
none	 stressful  taliesin thats not bad yeah so thats 34  cheering  taliesin rolled a 12 on the inspiration dice  matt with that the feverish pace of the scrolling as you work across the final trammel  grog its almost to the point where hell move the chisel to a place youll hammer move back  and hes going too fast and he has to go back and while hes not even looking at you the chisel  will clang multiple times across the side of it telling you to fucking hit the back of it with the 
none	  hammer you take it and slam it move along eventually coming across each side of the  spiraling trammel to completion at that point the hammer still in your grasp you back away  percival you take it and the heated edge of it is burning into your hand a little bit and you walk  over and drop it into the trough water sizzling turn around drop it next to the third and final  piece  taliesin and i faint  laughter  matt and as percival hits he passes out onto the stairs halfleaning onto the 
none	 stairs you  catch him grog you look at your feet where percival left the last piece and you reach down  and pick up the three trammels theyre about that long each of them and theyre these heavy  spikes that come to a gradual spiraling twist at the tip theyre covered in intricate beautiful  scrolling of some sort of arcane language that you are unfamiliar with and you dont think youve  been so proud to be part of crafting anything like this before  travis these are obviously too dangerous for this world and i walk 
none	 over to the lava  laughter  travis kidding  laura this is a step up from fine leather boots grog  travis yeah its true  matt and with the completion of the trammels this leg of your journey now complete were going  to close tonights episode good game sighs well pick up this at gencon next week at our live show  marisha so gencon were going to start with trying to get out of an active volcano  taliesin well i think well assume that were going to take a mansion rest and well come out 
none	 of  a mansion rest can we assume thats going to be it  matt if you want to take that point now well say with the end of this episode you guys take a  mansion rest no  travis no  laura or are you tapped out do you have any spells left scanlan  sam i saved one level eight spell for such a thing  laura so we head into the mansion  marisha and i technically have one 7thlevel spell so if we want to go into the mansion and  then i can plane 
none	 shift us home we can do that or wherever we want  taliesin so we can plane shift mansion wherever we need  travis and if we go into the mansion the first purple servant that hands me a salad i behead  unless its the gofibepo  matt so are you going to long rest and then plane shift or plane shift and then long rest wherever  you land  marisha plane shift and then long rest  laura if were in the mansion he cant see us so thats the only thing it might be good to

none	  plane to another plane  taliesin we need to rest lets rest yeah ignore it  marirsha well figure it out at gencon well figure it out in indianapolis  laura fuck it well do it live  taliesin and travis well do it live  matt all righty then so well pick up there next week at gencon exhales all right guys  travis that fucking giant swordswinging bastard is he even wearing underpants under that we dont know  laura no hes not i saw his balls i saw his golden balls  liam its a big
