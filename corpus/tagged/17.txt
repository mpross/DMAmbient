announcement  matt i think so it was very informative thank you travis all right then without further ado  lets go ahead and cut to the intro and then well jump right into the next episode of critical role  dramatic music  matt welcome back so picking up after the events of last week to give you /none/ guys a little bit of a  refresher after the party had returned from their journey into vasselheim for quite a few weeks  they discovered upon returning that the illustrious briarwoods current owners of castle  whitestone and overseers of the entire city of whitestone and sticking point in percys  background were coming to emon to meet for essentially a political banquet with sovereign  uriel taldorei to discuss construction of a bridge it was a very political endeavor and the  council of taldorei was invited including vox machina  there was a week of preparation in /none/ going into this event to see exactly what the briarwoods were  about information was gathered at this banquet vax went on his own little adventure into the  briarwoods room in which they nearly killed him chuckles  liam hey everybody  matt i didnt notice the shirt until now so yeah the party rushed out to his aid much  violence ensued the briarwoods eventually escaped through some sort of magical means that was not  uncovered however they are no longer in the picture the party was left with a destroyed  carriage a young carriage driver /none/ who had his hand shot off by percy and was then told to the guards  to haul off and bring to their keep to throw into their cell for further questioning uriel was  eventually drawn out and confused by the sudden chaos and vehemently requested that vox machina  return the next morning to go over what has transpired after which the party during this  event had encountered a tiefling by the name of lillith who was masquerading as one of the  servants within the palace of taldorei aided them in the battle and revealed that /none/ she was being  hunted by her sisters in a distant land and revealing herself here essentially opened up her  physical presence to be pinpointed and then immediately sought and hunted by whoever was after  her the party then brought her back to the keep they were on the way back before they were  encountered by this bounty hunter and a small team of individuals that were coming with him to seek  down capture lillith and bring her back to her sisters the party then defended her in this  circumstance brutally murdering one of them /none/ sorry brutally murdering two of them one of  which was then raised and sent off as a present to the sisters by lillith one was salvaged not  given an honorable death and sent to find his way somewhere northwest of emon possibly towards  vasselheim or wherever else he may find his adventure they then gave lillith the opportunity  to come stay the night to rest in the keep and they all made their way back to greyskull keep for the  evening and that was where we left off  so as the evening progresses you /none/ all manage to get your rest and gather your thoughts over the rather  stressful experience you had the previous evening within the palace the next morning comes around  you all come to consciousness breakfast is prepared by the servants of the keep as you all  wake up start getting your meals and gathering what you want to do for the day two individuals  have not come down for their meal lillith and percy  orion good morning everyone  sam not everyone were missing two a male and a female  laura oh no  travis /none/ you dont think  laura percy was upset  sam maybe he needed some comforting  orion oh i see are you saying theyre having relations  sam im not saying that  laura perhaps we should check on them  travis we should totally check on them  sam okay but if theres a sock or a gun on the doorknob dont go in  laura or a ribbon she wore a ribbon  orion well i was thinking last night grog that were probably going to be here for a little bit  before going anywhere do we /none/ go anywhere  laura we have to go see uriel  orion who oh right yes also i really want to see allura for no particular actually for very  specific reasons yes  travis i think hes lying  orion one of them is i want to pick up one of the earrings of telecommunication it has been  finished for quite some time we just have to go to where she resides to pick it up then one of us  could have another one  liam that robe just takes it to a whole new level  /dung/ laura yeah it really does  orion i feel so good  liam im somewhat entranced  orion im telling you its helping too  travis do i feel a little tingle from my belt and can i roll for a beard check  sam oh beard check  travis six two  matt you wake up realizing that the morning has transpired you reach up and grab and what you  guys notice as he comes up is there is a dark charcoal smear across one side of his face where  facial hair would once be to match /none/ the other side that is currently beautiful quaff and shining in  the dapples of morning light that come through the keep window  travis you know the remedy for it you just turn your face in the looking glass  laura yeah from this angle you look amazing grog  travis my god im so handsome right and then just horror sheer horror  orion poof a little dust and fix that for him  laura oh so it looks normal again i like it yeah beautiful dont touch it  matt the colors a little off but it /none/ looks better than not having it  marisha in my head youre like those mr wooly magnetic toys when youre a kid  travis i would shave it and get it even but lets be honest given history its going to take  care of itself soon enough these things dont live very long  laura im going to go upstairs and see if our guest lillith is all right i dont want to  disturb percy just yet  matt all right you head to the guest room you have one guest room upstairs that was among the  /none/ rest of the rooms that you guys had constructed  travis singing theyre going to be getting it on  matt you knock on the door a moment passes no response  laura lillith are you with percy lillith  matt you knock a second time and the door creaks opens a little bit it has not really  been locked or closed  laura i peek my head in  matt you peek in and look  travis did you check for traps  matt roll a no im kidding  laughter  laura damn it  matt already /tavern/ off no as you peek into the room the lights are dimmed what little bit of candles  are in there are already down glancing in the sheets are clean and set the beds been made and  there is a small piece of parchment that is folded on the edge of the bed  laura go and read it  matt read it it reads vox machina thank you all for your hospitality and protection through  this past evening i would stay but the longer i remain the more danger i am in and as such put  /none/ all of you in as well i shall travel across the ozmit sea to seek the guidance of my cousin zahra  in hopes of finally getting out from under my sisters baneful gaze nevertheless i wish you  all the finest of journeys and i hope we meet again soon lillith  laura shes so cute  marisha i liked her bow it was cute  laura i tell everyone that shes gone gone  travis no shes in percys room scanlan lets go see if hes banging  sam all right lets go  laughter  matt you /none/ run up and percys room is the door is already partially ajar  travis boom  matt it bursts open wham slams on the side of the door looking in the room hes not there is  the first thing you notice however what you do see are a series of different books of sketches  and designs and halfconcocted blueprints for different things are crumpled and torn across the  room the bedsheets are thrown off the bed it looks like the room has been continuously tossed  through some sort of frenzied action either seeking something or just /none/ out of emotional  frustration this room is left in far more disarray than youre used to seeing true to  percys character  sam my god grog percys a hoarder  travis right  sam or hes in serious distress  travis i think its the previous  sam the hoarder  travis yeah probably  sam we must find him dont you think our friends in trouble i proceed down to his  tinkering lab doesnt he have some sort of lab downstairs  travis my rooms like shit and im not in trouble  sam well that /none/ goes with your character  matt yeah you head down to the basement area and to the right is the cell to the left is the  workshop the workshop door is currently closed there is a small slider eye vent where you can  peek through  sam can i reach the eye vent  matt you can if you leap hard enough and catch it on the edge  travis i boost him up  matt okay looking inside you can see the forge is aglow you hear the tangs of metal being  hammered against the anvil /none/ and you can see the form of percy framed against the backlighting of  the forge hes feverishly working away on some sort of project  travis is he naked  sam no hes working too hard maybe we should just leave him be seems focused driven like a  madman  travis oh i get it like a madman  sam i dont think you do  matt at which point a voice rings out from across the room percy unmoving still continuing his  work shouts over his shoulder please leave me be i have a lot to /none/ think about right now  sam would you like a meal brought down  matt im fine thank you really i need some time  sam all right if youre making things a little ladder for the little perch here might be nice  just in the future but not now that seems low priority  matt he stops his banging walks over and scribbles something on a paper then goes back to  banging noted clanging  travis i drop scanlan and i lean in and i go beware the water it burns  matt yes yes it does /none/ grog good boy  sam all right so we go back up tell the fellows percys in a mood hes creating right  now i think we should just leave him be  laura understandable  liam let him get it out of his system  marisha im really worried about him  sam yes  orion matthew rolling 12 im just trying to teach my pet something but i rolled a 12  matt for  orion oh i want it to follow to follow  matt to follow okay you gather based on the recent intensity of trying /none/ to teach things to  lockheed over the past week you succeed in a few there is a bit of balking frustration that perhaps  youve overstepped a little bit and lockheed feels maybe theres less of a friendship here more  than a real masterservant relationship at least in this moment and does not seem to be receptive  to your attempt  orion hes in a mood also why is everybody in a mood today  sam i know percys hatesmelting downstairs  laura percy has good reason to hatesmelt he seems rather disturbed that the briarwoods got /none/  away  sam yes i feel responsible  marisha out of curiosity did anyone else hear him did anyone else just happen to hear what he  said in that fight last night  laura i was a little bit preoccupied by watching him shoot a servant boy over and over and over  again  marisha it was after that actually  laura what did he say  marisha never mind  sam what no spit it out what did he say it seems important  marisha its hard to say you know percy i dont know where /none/ he gets these lines  sam is it fuck is it shit  travis cock bulls dong wang  liam steampunk  marisha jeez okay  travis donkey wang  marisha this is getting really off subject  orion im going to go down to my laboratory  laura what did he say  marisha it was when he was screaming the cluster of things as he was shooting that mercenary in the  face and he said what are you doing you have no reason to be here your soul is now forfeit  really that last part is /none/ the most important one the first stuff is fairly average but yeah your  soul is now forfeit  travis its a good line  laura its a really good line  sam thought he was just trashtalking you think theres more to it  marisha i thought it was maybe a line and then it seemed really aggressive and strong and specific  so it made me think a lot i dont know  laura did you ask him about it at all  marisha we havent seen him since that happened  travis what do you think  /none/ laura what do you think his pepperbox is what  marisha i think hes not telling us everything thats for sure  sam well we all have some secrets  marisha yeah but screaming your soul is now forfeit thats not a secret thats saying you  peed the bed when you were a kid  liam i worry too but he did lose his entire family  laura he did pee the bed when he was a kid  marisha oh really  liam i am assuming but he lost his entire family to those people  marisha sure /none/ but he wasnt screaming this at the briarwoods he was screaming this at a random  mercenary  laura well  marisha what does that mean  travis maybe his soul is forfeit  marisha to what  travis death  laura maybe we keep an eye on percy  sam thats a fair point though well keep an eye on him he seems to be in a fragile state  right now  laura percys not the one who killed a poor old woman though  sam did we kill her i thought we just made her sleep and /none/ then walked away  travis nope no total massacre  laura tiberius destroyed her  sam tiberius you killed an old woman  orion im not there  marisha yeah thats actually another thing i wanted to talk about that was also really  intense you know i get it it was a hard day it was a hard day and we tend to get a little  aggressive sometimes after hard days weve all been there but he didnt just murder an old  woman he chainsawed her a sleeping unconscious woman  travis it was pretty great  /none/ sam are you saying that we should take it down a notch or maybe not brutally destroy the bad  guys  marisha you also were the only other one who seemed to be confused as to what was going on  laura i shot her i shot her in the back lets be honest i didnt chainsaw her but i did shoot  her in the back as she was running away  sam i made her go to sleep that was peaceful  marisha thats what im saying that was good that was nice  laura i was /none/ aiming for her shoulder if it makes any difference  travis she did have that sweet little run which was so cute  sam are you taking moral exception to some of our behavior  marisha that might exactly be what im saying man you see this is why i like you scanlan  youre so much better at the words than me i dont think i even knew thats what i felt until  you said it just now  sam well this is something perhaps you should pray on and think on if theres something youd  like /none/ us to change about our behavior we can consider that were all friends were allies  here we should pay respect to you  marisha i just dont want us to  liam its a fair point we dont want to be corrupted by the very evil that we mean to stamp  out in this world she was trying to kill us but your point is taken  marisha she was a really old woman  liam but she wasnt the secretary she was trying to kill  marisha sure but she was unconscious  travis she actually didnt /none/ do anything either  marisha yeah she didnt really do anything at all  travis she could have been taking notes  laura she had a wand  marisha im not saying she wasnt a threat and im not saying we shouldnt handle threats im  saying maybe we shouldnt dissect a woman with a spinning krull blade whos sleeping on the ground  defenseless running away she was fleeing  sam all right you know this is constructive criticism and well take it as such and i for  one will maybe not desecrate and denigrate bodies  laura /tavern/ just beds and temples laughs  liam i dont know i mean i see what keyleths saying but i dont really want to cramp your  style scanlan  sam oh ill shit on things maybe not people  liam were like the ateam and thats your specialty i dont really want to see you  should just shit when you feel the urge  laura what time is it do we need to be getting to uriel  travis oh yeah what time is it  matt at this point its probably pushing on 11 am close to noon /none/  laura we should probably be getting to the palace  matt tiberius what did you say you were doing down there what did you say you were doing down  in your laboratory  orion well i was doing my research on that stuff last night and this morning  matt your which one  orion its just my ability because of my class i do the backstory  matt your backstory is  orion i am a noble sage  matt well theres a noble and theres a sage  orion yeah i know and i spliced them /none/ because it made sense no the noble part is the rp the sage  is the perk  matt okay gotcha thats good to know all right  orion and i was writing down the sigil to the keep thats completed  matt okay so the sigil is there for you all right and so as the sage all right okay so  yeah not difficult to research there are a number of books theyre older books and things  that were installed as part of the construction of this laboratory for you and information that you  have gathered /none/ since there are various bestiaries and gatherings of information about the dangerous  denizens in the countryside around you and it is a very dangerous place outside of the few points  of civilized society that has built up its own defenses  throughout the evening and the morning youve managed to find eventually a piece that talks  about various undead entities and the process of undeath and necromantic magics that have been  perverted throughout the generations to defy the natural cycle of life you do come across an entry  about vampirism it is extremely rare and /none/ was largely thought abolished close to 200 years ago  there are very rare whispers of any sort of cases out there and usually as soon as something comes  to any sort of public knowledge large mobs gather and whoever was infected with this horrible state  was hunted down and killed  what you do learn from this is religious symbology while classically thought to have an  effect on people afflicted with vampirism actually has no effect its more of a  superstition but does not actually have any negative impact on the individual however  certain /none/ things that do render a vampire easier to destroy the presence of sunlight anything that  counts as sunlight can damage them progressively the longer theyre in it prevent them from  restoring their health and ultimately destroy them and turn them to ash should they be brought  to the brink of death in the presence of sunlight also very quickly and consistently rushing  water being held into a rushing stream or under a waterfall would have a similar effect to sunlight  you do also know the stake in the heart is also considered to be a /none/ way to destroy them it does  not actually destroy them but it does render them paralyzed and has to be done when theyre in their  resting place within their coffin andor the dirt that is considered their resting location usually  that is the beginning step to find and locate where the vampire is resting stake in the heart  and then carry the body to sunlight or rushing water and thats how theyre permanently  destroyed you also find out that if a vampire is thought to be killed under any other  circumstances the body turns /none/ to mist and is nigh invulnerable and eventually finds its way back to  wherever theyve hidden their resting place to recover within a very short period of time making  them extremely dangerous unless you have the right situation the right conditions to bring  them to that point so that information is now at your disposal  orion wonderful  travis do you want to tell us what youve learned  orion i did it right this time knowing that i take some files and i want to check if i can  nope i cant do anything /none/ yet thats it im going to go upstairs  matt okay so as you guys have gathered the time and what you might be going forward doing for  the rest of the day tiberius comes upstairs with a bit of a smile and an air of confidence  laura oh good youre back  liam tibs we were just discussing the future of the group and the direction weve been taking and  a point was introduced that maybe perhaps we started as a sort of a mercenary group is a bit  strong but this alliance we have /none/ formed out of convenience we all needed to eat but now that  were at the stature we are in a keep in emon friends to the emperor we want to figure out what  were doing here do we want to be just powerful badasses who walk around getting what they want  or are we trying to enact some positive change in this world  orion yes absolutely thats what my items are for ive only found one of them there are still  three or four if they even exist out there there are countless things to /none/ go and venture forth and  explore  travis what your items  orion the artifacts the ring of boros the old hag that is the next step in my quest she told  us it would be in the feywood right  matt feywild close researcher  orion that is where we need to go but thats why we ran into her in vasselheim and she  wouldnt tell me anything more  marisha how do you plan to use your items for better good in the world  orion well youve seen how ive used my mending wheel /none/ countless ways  travis yeah thank you you healed my cask ill always be grateful  orion moreover it would prove to the council that all of the things that i went on this journey  for to begin with it was true or for naught and really to gain the respect of my father and  everyone else you dont know how hard it is to be a chromatic dragon in a metallic world its not  easy  liam well theres no question that you are an invaluable member of vox machina and our friend  and our /tavern/ family and that is not in question  orion of course which is why i have pledged my loyalty to you all and i need your strength as  well there is no way i could accomplish in my mission alone i mean grog when i ran into you  in that one bar how many men were you beating up i counted eight if i recall  travis i think that sounds right  sam he cant count  travis its that many  orion here was this brute who i would have ran away from but here you /none/ were and i found you to  be rather charming i figured well thats some good company to keep rather and then i met the  rest of you and look where we are now  laura yes tiberius the point of this is you killed an old woman last night very brutally  please maybe dont do that again  orion she felt nothing but of course and i was giving my new krull blade a good old try  laura yes you were maybe not on sleeping people anymore people who are actually attacking us  orion she /none/ was okay fine  liam well i think the point is your abilities in arcane wonder are expanding daily exponentially  and perhaps be a little tentative do a little practice run in the woods on your own once in  a while and see what the effects are before you go whipping it out  orion are there woods nearby  sam this is an intervention we love you very much but you killed an old lady  travis i like the way you kill people  orion well yes  laura were all on the up and up /none/ now right  orion one raises a hand to me or vox machina they are going to die  travis yeah yeah they are  orion it is simple i do not know why this is a discussion i wont be as cruel  marisha you know she didnt even really do anything she was really old  laura she was attacking us  liam keyleth  marisha what  liam clearly we all love you as family and nobody blames you but you once killed a child  and none of us blame you for that  travis is /none/ it too early to start drinking i pull out the cask of ale  liam and that happened in the heat of battle  marisha you know im really sensitive about that vax im really sensitive about that  vax  liam im well aware  marisha and that was different  laura it was an accident  marisha that was pretty fucking deliberate what he did  orion yes to someone who was opposing us that was a child who was innocent or was he opposing  us too i dont remember actually  liam and it all falls /none/ apart  marisha he was being puppeted by sorcerer michael jackson  liam no one agrees with you today more than i and i think we can adjust our perspective  slightly right grog  travis whats the word  liam see  sam kill softer  orion ill show you how you just have to do it really slow  laura uriels waiting for us  sam lets table this well stick a pin in this discussion well all be thinking long and hard  about this  laura keyleth it wasnt intentional and everybody knows that  liam /none/ absolutely not intentional no  marisha i turn into minxie and start walking  travis minxie i go and give a little scratch behind the ears  matt you guys gather and make your way into the city of emon proper  laura actually before we head towards uriel we probably should do we have any sort of proof  that the briarwoods actually did horrible things and it wasnt us attacking them  liam well ive got these little scars right here  matt the scars are still there theyre still wounds that are healing  laura all right /none/ cool just making sure that we had something  liam and then there was whatshisname awesome pants who was there  laura seeker asum  orion allura saw everything as well  sam did she see the fight  laura allura didnt see the fight  liam we know she knows whats up but whether she can be used as a reliable witness is weve got  multiple witnesses  sam there were those guards too there was guards outside the door  liam they were incinerated  sam oh yeah  laura plus they were the briarwoods guards anyway /none/  orion one of them was still alive i didnt kill both of them  laura he went away with the briarwoods im going to assume  travis what a dick we go to see uriel  matt okay  travis i made a choice for the team  laughter  matt as youre having this discussion all of you make your way into the city of emon across the  districts to the cloudtop youre greeted and let within the gate into the central district there  you make your way to the palace of taldorei through the front /none/ doors the guards that are there  lead you in and one of them says uriel is waiting within the throne chamber you guys are  led down the main hallway into the very center of the palace  marisha i come out of minxie  matt the nervous guard thankfully puts his weapon away and is like oh lady keyleth my  apologies and puts his spear to the side  laura trinkets still here though  liam i buzz over to that specific guard and say do you have a lost and found here i have this  /none/ really badass serpentstyle belt sometimes it crawls around on its own sometimes its just a  belt and i lost it here the other night and im really hoping i mean it ties everything  together is there anyone i can check with  matt check back after youve spoken with the sovereign please thank you leads you guys on  as you head down the main hallway and you recall this hallway this was a long dangerous trek the  first time you came to the palace this was where uriels family was possessed this is where you  /none/ had your battle with the glabrezu this is where pike was slain this is where you had to pull the  shadows from the bodies of his family this is a very emotional place that you really havent been  to since that sequence of events walking in already has this tenuous state of lowsimmering  energy as youre brought into the main chamber you can see there is the dual thrones for uriel  and his wife his wife is not present his family is not present just uriel sitting on the throne  there are a few guards /none/ on the different entrances to the room as you walk in uriel just sits there  on the throne and gives you acknowledgment and ushers you into the room you all step in trinket  behind you keeping an eye out like a bear is wont to do  you guys make your way up towards the very edge of the central raised dais where the thrones are  currently set up on you now see on the opposite side of the room seeker asum and allura walk in  as well as arbiter brom who is the cleric that /none/ is the master of law in the city they walk up and  flank the sides of the throne stepping back a little bit to not gather all the attention but  definitely be there as a show of support as they enter the doors on the other side of the room and the  door behind you open and roughly 30 guards enter the chamber quietly they all filter in blocking  all the exits the doors close no weapons are drawn but there is a very strong showing of  muscle in this room that you werent expecting /none/ for this meeting  once all the guards are settled and a really awkward silence hits the room uriel stands up  from the throne and looks upon you pacing slightly back and forth thank you all for  joining me i must say i am troubled by recent events and i wish to speak to you regarding them  before taking any action i owe you that much for all youve done for me before you left for  vasselheim you showed immediate interest in the briarwoods percy in where is percival  sam well hes not feeling well /none/ today after the events of last night so he stayed behind  matt well then please relay this conversation to him as soon as you see him you exhibited  interest in the briarwoods before leaving for vasselheim i through trust did not inquire as  to why but upon your return eagerly told you they were coming to this feast and invited you as  part of the council of taldorei to join this feast as it was your request i graciously  followed through you showed up a meal was had questions were asked although curious ones i /dung/ did  not pry now i have since been notified and seen a bit of the aftermath that you vox machina  seemingly attacked our guests shortly please listen attacked our guests shortly after the meal  in their own guest quarters forcing them to flee after you destroyed the hallway ruined their  carriage murdered two of their guards two more outside and leaving seeker asum to witness this  entire process asum gives a nod you then tortured their carriage driver requested he be  sent to the dungeon beneath your keep and upon my sentries returning from /none/ greyskull to deliver him  they find a freshly murdered old woman not far behind the path you took not long after seeker  asum found me and corroborated most of this unexpected violent behavior i then asked arbiter  brom here to divine the nature of this murder and through his divine sight through the goddess  ioun comes to tell me it was none other than you tiberius that slaughtered this elderly woman  while she slept  orion yes  matt now i am quite disturbed by the events of these past 14 hours and i would /none/ like to hear an  explanation arbiter if you could please prepare the space arbiter brom steps forward and  pulls forth from underneath his robes a necklace that contains a holy symbol the same symbol you  saw across the temple beneath the slayers take an eyelike inscription of the god ioun brom  grasps it looks about you all and prepares this slight hand gesture and you feel a slight tingle  across the skin that lasts a few seconds  marisha can i recognize the spell hes casting  matt ill say go ahead and make a /none/ this would be a religion check  marisha hes doing a cleric thing yeah seven  matt all right unable to ascertain the nature however the incantation completes no seeming  noticeable effect brom nods and steps back in the line of the thrones i want all of you guys to  roll charisma saving throws  marisha son of a bitch always a problem  orion 19  marisha 11  sam i get advantage and i rolled a 27  matt laughs okay bards  liam 19  laura 13  travis 18  matt all right good /none/ to know uriel then looks to the rest of you so ive said my piece for the  moment explain  liam i step forward  marisha can i do a quick insight check on asum to see if i can still recognize if hes still  affected by the mindcontrol thing  matt go ahead and make an insight check sure  marisha ooh yeah 28  matt glancing at asum the way hes looking at you and the general tension and feeling of the  room you gather that asum is not his normal self completely you step /none/ forward  liam uriel with all respect i neednt remind you what the group of people before you put  themselves through on your behalf and your familys behalf we almost lost one of our own  and if that counts for nothing here then nothing makes sense but if that is not enough let us  start here  orion the briarwoods are vampires and that old lady who was a butthole by the way was with this  demonoid person who we had to fight as well  liam one thing at a time thats true but one /none/ thing at a time we had prior knowledge of the  briarwoods intentions before this evening and i myself went to spy on them  laura heres the thing percy doesnt like them because they killed his family they took over his  home after killing his family he got away he knows theyre scary were trying to protect you  orion so the point is we all know how dangerous it is that the knowledge of vampire existence and  the spreading of those vile creatures and now we know they do exist so however the means that that /none/  came about is neither here nor there we know where they are  travis and if youre wondering how we know theyre vampires whispering vax this is your  cue  liam i will subject myself to any test to any wizard or mage in this city who you know can  ascertain the truth to look through my eyes to see my memories i dont know shit about magic  but there are people who do  sam cleric tristan also treated him last night for his vampireinflicted wound i know this all  looks really bad on /none/ the surface and we did not want to cause any disturbance within these  hallowed walls but there was a danger we acted perhaps too abruptly and without telling you  laura we tried to get your attention i called for you immediately as soon as we knew there was  danger  liam and dont take our word for it anyone have them look in here  orion actually you take a stormwinds word for  matt silence silence youre in my court now stormwind you put so much weight upon this trust  and you have done a /none/ good service but also ive heard whispers that youve thrown this trust  around in many circles remember we held a parade in your honor we spread the word of the good  deeds youve done we at our own costs of emon built you a keep a home at great expense to  show thanks and also i believed upon allowing you to join the council put us square i owe you  nothing just as you owe me nothing  liam do you not want the truth  matt i want the truth but i also want you /none/ to understand the stakes that are here and why there  is this question as the leader of this not this city but this entire countryside i have to be  sure and this is not the first time i have been lied to by very close trusted people so i have  to be thorough  liam this is why i offer myself completely into your control and put myself under your supervision  and any user of the arcane arts you want to  peer inside my mind let them step up to the  plate because i /none/ have nothing to hide  laura also while you are inquiring about him you might inquire about seeker asum  sam if youre worried about lies within your own ranks i think you should start with him  marisha in fact i actually might be able to help seeker asum if you will allow me to  sam help him  matt you glance over at asum and asum gives a look to uriel and uriel  laura he was mindcontrolled last night  matt i have had asum at my side for the better part of 15 years he /none/ is responsible far more than  your merry band has ever attempted for keeping and maintaining the good and lawful state of this  country  liam uriel your own family was not themselves and you know that look into my mind now today  you dont need to guess anything  matt it would also do you well to show respect we are speaking halfelf now i would assign  allura to such an endeavor however it has also been noticed that she has grown quite friendly and  attached to your group and in this circumstance there is /none/ question so you will be in a few days  assigned an individual to this ritual of which you are presenting yourself  marisha uriel please  matt shh the briarwoods regardless of what you may think they may be or we do that will  show in time have shown nothing over the past five years but graciousness and gone through all  proper channels to establish this relationship between our city and theirs far more than the  previous family ever attempted  liam well one may smile and smile and still be a villain  matt that /none/ goes both ways now please  marisha just let me do a quick restoration spell on asum if nothing is wrong with him nothing  will happen its harmless its like taking medicine when youre not sick it cant hurt and  if i am wrong then we can continue on we can have vax tested please itll take ten minutes  what can it hurt  laura up until last night he was himself trust us that now he is not  marisha he came to us  matt there has been nothing about his behavior at all to /none/ insinuate any change of anything of the  sort and i have known the man for quite some time before i even took this throne however i  will in the good graces and the relationship we forged allow this asum are you all right with  this  asum gives a nod well if this is to be how it is certainly and he steps forward the halfling  approaches you looking you in the face all right you would like to attempt your greater  restoration spell  marisha first i meditate for a second and i cast /none/ enhance ability on myself  matt as a note as you begin casting you notice the guards all go for their weapons and ready  themselves uncertain of whats about to transpire there is a tension in the room based on  what this is going to be  marisha can i get some meditation music scanlan  sam oh chanting  matt all right so first you cast enhance ability on yourself  marisha am i maybe inspired by that  matt sure in the tension of the room this slow droning hum of the gnome which you can /none/ notice  some of the guards look at each other confused and asum puts his hand up like hold off  liam its tuvan throat singing  matt all right so first you cast enhance ability on your  marisha self  sam what ability  marisha to enhance wisdom wisdom  matt okay you reach out with greater restoration you complete the ritual you touch  onto the arms of asum it fades and you see in his eyes theres a moment of clarity and an  inhale a slight gasp like some realization hits him and his expression /none/ changes and looks towards  you and just goes he puts his hands out like this for a moment just trying to almost tell you  something go ahead and make a wisdom check just a d20 or no make an insight make a straight  insight this is more of an insight roll here  marisha okay oh 29  matt you get the sense through the subtlety of physical motion and expression asum is telling  you just go with me on this he steps back into the place next to the throne theres a brief  moment /none/ of pause uriel says and asum  asum goes my stance has not changed i know not what she is attempting or thought the situation  was but it appears to me that this was either misinformation or at least at the time being  hopefully not a lie but i believe brom has taken care of that yes  and brom gives a nod i certainly have hoped to  uriel goes hm all right heres the circumstance as it stands i fear i must revoke  vox machinas membership in the council of taldorei until further notice for /none/ the safety of  our countryside and the current tension in our relationship  sam objection thats it i just wanted to say that please continue i just want it noted that  we object strongly to this  matt i understand and this will only continue until all of our investigations are complete  sam are we still allowed free rein to roam about as we please are we under arrest for anything  matt you are not under arrest you are revoked from the council and you will be closely watched  until our investigations are complete  /none/ laura how long will your investigations take  matt he looks back to asum and asum says well depends on how quickly we can acquire the  information it could be weeks ill do my best to make it thorough and quick  laura are we allowed to leave the city in that time  matt uriel looks back and says you may leave if you wish know that there have been precautions  taken should you attempt to flee we will find you  liam and when are you to look into my mind  laura weirdo  laughter /none/  liam it freaking ends here right away  travis can you read my mind  liam there is no spoon  matt we ought to speak to the lyceum to find a proper individual of sufficient power and trust to  do this as allura right now is being kept out of the scenario  sam are we allowed to speak with allura  matt if you wish outside of these chambers do what you must to clear your name i would like  very much for this all to be true what youre saying but do not flee /none/ do not give an  inclination that you attempt to escape this judgment for we will take that as a sign of  guilt  liam weve no intention of going anywhere  matt should we conclude that your actions were beyond reason and the moral fiber of this council  before your return we will have no choice to put a bounty on your heads should you not return i  really really do not wish to do this do not make me do this  orion i stand up no need for threats friend are we done here /none/  matt i want to believe you all i ask you show that my trust has not been misplaced all this  time now you may leave  sam i look forward to the second parade youll throw for us after our names are cleared  matt very well  travis i turn to the guards that were grabbing at their weapons and i flex real fast at them and  then i walk  matt four of them go yelps  travis bitch  laughter  matt as you guys go back out the doors that you entered the /none/ guards now a little closely following  as you exit leading you out of the palace down the front steps and essentially stand at the  front of the palace gates  liam im sorry i was just talking to one of your friends have you seen a belt that is shaped like  a snake sometimes it moves around on its own and it answers to the name simon but usually its  just a belt and looks really cool have you seen it is there a lost and found i can check out  its very dear to /none/ me  matt the guard just looks for a second and goes i think youve got more important matters to deal  with before you go looking for a belt sir  liam wheres that other guy he was more receptive to this do i see that other guy  laura darling seriously  matt the guards all turn around and start ascending the stairs  liam its on all the fan art it really makes sense to have it on me  matt they dont appear to be listening  liam keep an eye out for it 100 gold /none/ to any chap who finds it and holds onto it for me  matt two of them stop in their step for a second and then keep walking  liam im a nice guy  laughter  matt go ahead and make a persuasion roll  travis youre going to get six belts thrown at you  liam thats terrible six  matt it was a brief pause but also a brief pause  laura you have a two in persuasion oh wow  sam well break in tonight and find it  travis could we wait outside for allura /town/  liam ill risk it all  matt all right so you are now currently there in the cobblestone street of the cloudtop district  removed from the council of taldorei and left in this interesting circumstance  sam keyleth what happened your magic didnt work  marisha no it worked  laura what happened  sam but asum lied  orion he gave her a magic winky face  marisha yeah essentially yeah he gave me like a  laura what does that mean does that mean uriels under their control i dont understand  liam is he playing /none/ some sort of long game here  sam it must mean that we have something to fear from uriel or someone else close  marisha i dont know who to trust anymore to be totally honest  travis really  marisha it worked i could feel it break it worked and hes got some sort of long game i  dont know if its because he doesnt want uriel to know for whatever reason i dont know if its  because he has some deeper ulterior motive  laura do you think he was faking that he was healed and /none/ maybe he wasnt  travis or maybe we have to bring proof of their vampirism back  marisha no  travis oh  marisha wait no to vex what was your question  travis to bring back proof of them being vampires  sam proof would help hey dont we have a prisoner cant we question the prisoner  laura is he bleeding out what if hes dead were so screwed  marisha i made sure  laura yeah the guy that percy shot the hand off of  marisha i cauterized his wounds remember  sam we should question /none/ him he could have proof  laura oh shit i hope everythings okay  orion wait a minute i really need to go to allura shes our best interest right now  sam we get it you want her body nows not the time  orion it is beyond that there are several reasons to go we need to get the earring of  telescription i need her to enchant something for me too as well as the fact i fear that our keep  may be in danger i would like to ask her if she may be able /none/ to set up a warding spell for  laura can you go get her and bring her to the keep i need to find out if this boy is all  right  marisha well we can split up i can go with you  matt as you guys are having this discussion the palace doors open and you hear the quick footsteps  of allura rushing from the palace now running towards you guys  laura saving the day again  marisha wait shes coming out of the palace  matt shes coming out of the palace behind you /town/ guys like after the council had just closed the  meeting had finished she basically gave chase to you guys and is now catching up to you on the  street  sam what the shit happened in there  marisha we were just talking about you  matt everyone i dont fully know what happened last night and she looks to you tiberius and  says you didnt did you please tell me you did not kill that woman  orion oh i absolutely did  laura but she was attacking us  sam it looks bad but she /none/ was a threat  orion her and another one with this what was he a tiefling named the broker attacked us and  thats why i killed her  matt broms divination is very clear and he divined that the woman was currently filled with  fear attempting to flee and unconscious when she was murdered  liam how did she flee when she was unconscious  travis she fled went unconscious then we butchered her  marisha just accept it for what it is guys  matt i just worry i know not what happened here and i heard /none/ what you said and i honestly do  not trust the briarwoods myself either there was something about that meal and the conversation  and their presence that put me off entirely it was strange and what you say makes a lot of  sense vampirism is a bit beyond what i was expecting i did sense some powerful masqueraded  arcane essence from lady briarwood look i would recommend for this to do your best to be thorough  in this bring back any and all information you can from the words i hear you probably have at  /none/ best a few weeks before this comes to a close and if you dont have enough evidence to support your  argument well i dont know  liam allura all i know how to do is break locks but ive seen these people do things with magic  that have defied expectations why can no one look into my memory you have looked across miles  cannot anyone look into my mind and see  laura theyre going to do it  sam yes but that might not be proof enough for them someone could have corrupted your mind  /none/ matt you have to understand not all arcane works that way there are magics that can dabble  in that realm but none that specialize that here in emon divination yes there are elements of  that we can see the physical we can see certain events but to look into ones mind is a different  magic entirely  liam are there no spells that can divine if someones speaking true  matt that was attempted during that council but after you left brom notified uriel and the  council that many of you were resistant to the spell /none/ and as such it could not be verified  laura laughs we should have rolled low just tell us youre doing it we wont resist it what  the shit doesnt even trust us to tell the truth  travis if we came back with proof  sam what sort of proof do you think they would accept the head of lady briarwood  laura no because itll disappear the minute we kill her or something theyre vampires i dont  know what they do  matt she gives a thought to that she goes interestingly enough if an artifact /none/ or an item  brought forth from them could be divined that should tell all  marisha is there still the remaining wreckage of their carriage is that still there  matt the carriage has been disposed its been picked over and there were remnants within the  rubble of some sort of a siggle of teleportation but that is no a sigil if you will  laughter  travis what sort of artifact like a brooch a handbag  liam are we talking about that motherfuckers teeth  orion i need to see that sigil  matt sigil were /none/ all learning together that i believe has all been investigated and kept under  lock and key with asum you would have to speak with him i would like to help i cannot come with  you im working on something else at the moment ah and she reaches into her pocket and brings  out your earring of transcription  orion thank you so much lady allura  matt as she hands it to you she gives you a really really concerned look and just gives it  to you and hands it back and its a look of /none/ and it hits you its a look of disappointment with a  hint of heartbreak  travis oh thats the worst im not angry im just disappointed ugh  liam i feel like ive failed you  travis yeah  matt she looks back to you as you take it and goes do your best to clear your name  orion i shall  matt i know you come of noble blood and many of you stand to inspire many others of noble blood  as celebrated heroes of this city there is a lot more on the line here /town/ besides just your  wellbeing theres a lot of people in this town that look up to you nevertheless ive already  said more than i should good luck  laura thank you allura  matt she looks behind and you can see she takes this small hood of the same material of her robe  that shes wearing and puts it up over her head and rushes off towards her white tower towards the  edge of the cloudtop district  liam fucking politics  sam no one insight checked her  travis shes telling the truth lets go /town/ make sure the prisoner isnt dead  sam all right so wait what are our avenues were going to have to columbo this what are our  avenues of finding proof  laura we say as were walking back to the keep  sam we have a prisoner we can question who knows if that will yield anything and then we might  have to go gather evidence which means leaving town against his word  laura well were allowed to leave town  liam and sam no  laura yeah no he said were allowed to leave we just /none/ cant look like were fleeing so we tell  them where were going they can even fucking follow us i dont care  liam so we tell them that were going to their political the people that theyre trying to  create a political relationship with were just going off to invade your political allies  travis oh come on you halfelves i swear to god have you never heard of lying before yeah  we dont tell them where were going were going on a field trip were going to pick berries fuck  all but we go there /none/  orion the only way we can go there is telling them  travis what and were going there what for  orion when i talk to asum and get that sigil to that damn briarwood keep thats how we get  there  travis why dont we say were taking a picnic oh we took a wrong turn hey its the  briarwoods  orion we dont have to lie to them we tell them where were going and we can just go there  travis we dont have to if we dont want to  liam youre pretty /none/  laura especially that beardy side grog  travis its a full beard right now  matt what you do know is the sigil that a teleportation circle is attached to is known when  you cast or create the circle the circle does not necessarily indicate or maintain the sigil its  attached to  orion its just a piece of it  matt meaning there are two parts to it there is the sigil that it sends to and there is the  actual ritual circle that is created the circle that attaches to it is not the /dung/ same as the  destination there are elements of it that connect it but you would not be able to ascertain a sigil  to whitestone immediately from looking at the initial circle  liam thanks for the cups guys the cup  travis i just noticed that  liam well lets go check on this poor little shit in the dungeon  sam and then the next step will be to seek out seeker asum  orion id like to stop by the temple real quick to pick up my decanter  sam how many errands do you have /none/ to run  laura endless errands  sam all right go run your errands weve got a mystery to solve  travis yeah i want to be there when we talk to the prisoner too  matt okay you guys make your way back to greyskull keep are you going with them or  youre  orion im doing all the shit  matt what are you doing  sam hes got a list  matt i would like to know the list  orion im going to stop at an armory because i want my crossbow reinforced i dont /none/ know what  that means i want to learn a different sigil the one that i researched for the waste fair or for  the way the feywild theres this big city next to it that i researched that is near it and in  that city might be a sigil so im going to go see if i can learn it and then i want to come back  and start enchanting my blades  sam its a busy day  matt okay  orion i can give it to you i wrote it down  sam coming soon /none/ on friday nights the adventures of tiberiuss errands 700 to 1000 every friday  night on twitch  orion and then i have to go to the dry cleaners for my robe  matt all right so as you begin that process the rest of you continue back to the keep as you  approach greyskull keep there are two individuals waiting for you at the gate that you do not  recognize from a distance  sam wait what say that again  matt theres two individuals waiting for you at the gate you can see at a distance /none/ but you dont  recognize  sam theyre our handlers probably  liam grog come on lets go have a talk with someone  laura i walk with you  sam were all going  liam lets go arm in arm in one big line  laura well theyre right at our fucking keep its not like were all headed in the same  direction anyway  orion who doesnt have a ring  sam a ring of what  orion an earring  marisha i have one right now  sam i think i do  laura i have /none/ one  liam i have one  laura grog doesnt have one  travis how far away from the keep are we  matt youre probably a good 100 to 150 feet  travis i whistle really loud and say who are these fucks in front of the keep to the guard  that we have employed  matt okay so let me try and see whos on duty right now  laura he has notes on who is on duty  matt this would still be shayne and cordell cordell shouts down from the top of the wall and /none/  says i dont think theyre a threat  travis right well be the judge of that as you were  sam grog keep in mind these are our allies  laura hello  matt as you walk up and you get close you get a better view youre expecting ominous armored  guards somebody possibly assigned to escort you instead youre greeted by what looks to be an  older couple waiting at the gate a man and a woman dressed in simple clothes weathered skin  and as you go out to them they both smile  sam /none/ we hate old people  laughter  laura who are you  travis favored enemy  matt they begin walking up and the man steps forward you can see hes got small dirty glasses  at the end of his nose and says hello hello good afternoon everyone im sorry to be a  bother but unless my eyes and tales do deceive me might you all be the heroes known as vox  machina  laura can i insight check to see if these guys are legit  sam legit what old people  laura it could be lord /none/ and lady briarwood for all i know  liam me too i did well i rolled 18 on them  matt okay from what you can tell they are both happy simple folk that are here with a tension of  purpose but nothing that seems to set off any alarms  sam we are vox machina im sure word of us has spread far and wide were a pretty big deal why  have you made this journey to us  matt the woman whos holding his side lets go of his arm and says we come to you /none/ humbly as  representatives of the farming community just north of emons walls  marisha oh i love farmers  matt i am riley klaus and this is my husband ben pleasure to meet yall  laura hi  matt you see many of us here we make our living through livestock and small crops ben  takes over at this point and says word is that the sovereign will be calling down troops from  fort daxio for a while so the need for meats and fresh produce has been elevated  the wife riley then says around this /none/ time over the past two weeks a number of our finest  cows and sheep have gone missing no struggle or mess or signs of dire wolves nothing we  suspected thieves initially but we sent up our neighbors boy kyle to watch over them until  sunrise and he saw the culprit from what he described a giant bird larger than anything hes  ever seen or heard of  ben then takes over the conversation wings at least ten carts long tip to tip just swooped  down he said without sound and in one motion snatched up /none/ one of our most virile bulls mr  simms just gone like that  marisha mr simms  matt that was the bull  riley says kyle said he saw it fly northwest  marisha northwest can i do a nature check to see if i can recognize the creature hes describing  liam are we certain hes not describing a dragon  marisha 26  matt 26 youve seen some big birds in your time this is from what theyre describing a lot  bigger than any birds youve encountered in your experience youve heard whispers of larger birds /none/  in the wild but youve never seen anything like that you havent had any personal experience  hearing or seeing anything of this size  marisha but it is a bird  matt thats what they described it as at night  laura when did these birds start showing up  matt about two weeks ago when the whole thing started to happen  and then ben kicks in and says should this keep up most of us will lose everything before the  year is out now weve talked with the leaders of the farming community this side /none/ of emon weve  scrounged up what we could  and he brings up a couple of coin purses and she goes 512 gold pieces 37 silver and 103 copper  thats all we can spare  laura keep your money  marisha yes keep your money  matt we cant possibly  liam what about this what if you supplied us with a small stream of produce for our servants  here at the keep for cooking for feeding them for feeding us when were here itll be a sight  less than 500 it wouldnt be nothing you /none/ could still give us something  matt yes we could wed be more than happy to  sam however despite what my companion is saying we are not agreeing to go after this winged beast  quite yet we hear your plight and we sympathize and we will do what we can but we have very  pressing matters right now is there a deadline of some sort when is your next harvesting season  matt i mean theres no deadline but the longer that goes by the more and more we lose by the  night two weeks in /none/ and weve lost half of our livestock if the creature is this big i imagine  it eats quite a bit  laura and how long of a ride is it is it walking distance  matt to where  laura liam and sam to your farm  matt north side of emon  laura oh so real close  matt yes  sam we are friends of the elderly obviously and also of the farming community so we are very  interested in helping you may we talk about it a bit before we decide how and when we /none/ would tackle  this problem  matt they look at each other and nod and he taps her hand and says yes by all means if you  could please help us stop this beast from ruining our livelihood  marisha and can you please tell us how to get to your place do you normally stay there are you  normally home  matt we wander about the community but we do have a homestead if you look its the large red  wood and partially brickbased homestead closest to the city walls on the north farm right  /none/ outside of emon its hard to miss if youre headed that direction  liam quickly presently we will find you guys we were told to sit and spin basically i mean  whats wrong with earning some brownie points in the eyes of uriel  travis mr and mrs kraut as friends of the elderly  matt klaus  travis right kraut do they normally come at night or have they ever abducted any of your  sweet bulls during the day  matt weve not seen it during the day itd be easier for us to identify if we /none/ had seems to only  hunt at night  sam and have they ever messed with a human  matt not that weve heard of not yet he gives you this sudden look of realization and fear and  pats and comforts his wife who suddenly realizes oh my are they going to take us now  marisha well probably be by like tonight or tomorrow morning  liam yes tomorrow morning at the latest we have a little bit of business yeah  marisha so were in the middle of doing something well get to it  matt all /none/ right well thank you  liam i take him by the hand and say we will see you presently  sam here my business card  liam and you can take that to the bank  laura you cant actually its worth nothing  matt well thank you for listening to us ramble on and we look forward to hearing from you in the  next day  laura you will  matt all right he pats her on the arm  travis travel safe mr kraut  liam hide your bull hide your wife  matt they both wander /none/ off  laura we are in danger of being ostracized we should really be nice to everybody right now  sam we were just having a conversation about how we should try to be nice from now on but we do  have very pressing matters  travis yeah lets get fucking in there and talk to that little  marisha its funny how that type of thing can come back to bite you in the ass  sam i call up to cordell oi cordell  matt yeah  sam remember when i told you not to let anyone /none/ linger outside the keep  matt to be fair the klauses are wellknown in the community  travis the krauts  laura the klauses  matt they came here for business i figured it was probably something youd want to hear i  apologize  sam by all means use your judgment over the orders of your master thats fine  marisha scanlan  matt cordell bows his head sheepishly i apologize im sorry  marisha ignore him  laura we are here to help people were here to help  matt he does his finger like this and the /none/ gates open in towards the inside of the keep wall  marisha and what is wrong with you all today  sam we had a really bad dinner last night thats all  laura i head straight to the jail  marisha i follow  matt as you guys are doing that tiberius whats the first thing youre trying to do  orion stop by and pick up the decanter from the temple  matt okay he said it required two days its been less than a day since you dropped it off  just so youre aware  orion /none/ then the only thing i do is visit the keep with the sigils library or whatever  matt oh the lyceum okay  liam im not going im just going to go hang out up on the wall outside the keep  matt all right as you head to the lyceum the clerk lets you in what are you specifically  looking to find or research  orion the sigil thats closest to the feywild  matt okay in researching what they have at their disposal you understand that the feywild itself  because it is a separate plane the /none/ magics to traverse it are a little more difficult to do if  you notice and ill confirm here just to be sure that were on the same page before i go full on  this here pardon me just a moment while i scan through the book the mighty book the book of  might yes sigils of teleportation require the same plane of existence meaning you can teleport  anywhere within the prime material plane that you exist in to traverse into the feywild you have  to actually find a door into the feywild and then you /none/ would be able to use a sigil from the  feywild  orion then i only pick up my decanter  matt which is not ready yet  orion i dont do that damn i forgot my shortterm memory is just jacked  matt its all good its all good  travis you know somebodys been to the feywild  matt yeah the feywild what you do find is that the feywild the boundaries between this realm  and the feywild tend to grow weaker at full moons its tied to the moon cycle and at certain  places where /none/ nature is set to run wild a lot of druidic tribes tend to mark these locations and  in some cases actually guard them  laura we know where a hole in one is grog went through it  matt and if you recall good memory in the frostweald the partially frozen forest where you  had that conversation with the nymph that portal that she existed through was specifically a door  into the feywild which you recognized  orion what city was that near  matt that was south of westruun  orion then ill go to the /none/ thing and ill find the westruun sigil  matt okay through your research you do find a sigil to westruun this is allowing you to go into  this portion for this sigil because youve already used the favor that you had to get the sigil of  kraghammer  orion no i didnt i used the amulet and we got permission to come there i saved that favor for  this  matt right the favor for gilmore all im saying is youve used one of two favors to get that  sigil you have to invoke gilmores favor /none/ to get this one okay and since youre a part of the  circumstance you acquire the secondary sigil you now know in your memory permanently a sigil to  westruun you dont know where in westruun but you are connected there if you choose to teleport  there you know how to that favor has now been used by gilmore so you can mark that and on that  note were going to go ahead and take a five minute rest break so yeah restroom snacks  drinks and well be back here in about five or so minutes /none/ well see you guys and continue this  tense adventure  break  matt welcome back weve had our break weve returned to the table a quick note we are 50  subscribers away from our next giveaway  travis 50 come on  matt if we can get there thatd be awesome well have our giveaway the signed cast critical  role photo and the cast signed art poster by kit buss  sam kit buss ladies and gentlemen  matt yeah so you have all returned to the keep you have found yourselves down to the basement  /none/ area you hear the distant pinging of metal an occasional squeaking metallic noise like  something is being altered turned or quenched in a water trough like the process of  blacksmithing  marisha i go to the edge of the door and knock  matt as you knock on the metal door its like a boom the pinging stops just hangs for a  second  marisha percy its keyleth  matt not right now please im sorry i just need to clear my head  marisha okay well be here  matt a moment later you see percys /none/ eyes appear at the edge of the door  marisha hi  matt just looking at them you can see they look a little sunken a little weary  marisha did you sleep  matt not as much as id like  marisha do you need anything  matt his eyes look away for a second looks back at you im all right thank you  marisha we went and saw uriel everyone in the city hates us they think were all criminals  matt great i have to get back to my work  marisha okay yeah  matt /none/ the slit shuts  marisha oh well see you later then  matt you guys however walk down to the other side of the cell the cell doors been closed the  keys are hanging on the nail by it you have not used the cell until this point its technically  pristine and unused since the construction of the keep but the keys still hang on the key ring on the  inside of it there is no thatch nothing has been put in to really make a comfortable floor and  hanging from manacles  laura hes hanging /none/  sam were the worst  matt he was put in as a prisoner  laura i go and get the keys and i take him down from the manacles  matt as she rushes into the cell begins unlocking the manacles hes unconscious at this  time dirt streaked on his face and spatters of dried blood from the blast of the gun  marisha i go ahead and i administer cure wounds  matt the wound at this point has been cauterized you cast cure wounds as he starts to come to  consciousness in a heap on /none/ the ground coughs it appears he may be healed of any damage he may  still be sustaining from that but the fingers are gone this is beyond the magic youre capable of  he comes to consciousness on the ground dirtied sore essentially broken before you  laura does he look like hes been bitten at all  matt you want to inspect  laura can i look at his neck  matt go ahead and make an investigation check  laura 20  matt okay you dont have a whole lot of medicinal experience but you take a /none/ moment and  inspect both sides of his neck tilting his head sidetoside as hes groaning and coming to  whats going on looking at the sides of his neck there does not appear to be any sign of any  puncture wounds anything that would be reminiscent  of what your brother currently is healing from  marisha can i do an insight check to see if he is also under a mindcontrol spell  matt at the moment no he is barely coming to consciousness there isnt enough of a presence at  the moment to really read /none/ past  laura hey there welcome back  matt where am i  laura you are being held at the moment for your own safety  matt for my own safety  laura yeah  matt how he looks at his hand  laura well you were captured were pretty sure the briarwoods are going to be pissed as hell that  you let the carriage get hit were just trying to protect you really  marisha really  sam i mean his friends all died so  marisha do we not feel like terrible people enough already  sam /none/ lets not have this conversation in front of the prisoner whats your name boy  matt my name is desmond desmond otham i am the son of a messenger a courier of the de rolo  family  marisha hes the son of a messenger thats even more ironic  laura keyleth do you need to step outside  marisha no im good continue son of a messenger  laura right now everyone is at risk the briarwoods are bad people you can attest to this  yes  matt yes  laura yes can you tell us everything you /none/ know about them  matt its not going to matter theyre going to find me no ones supposed to get away  laura you did  travis theres always a first time  matt i dont even know where to begin he adjusts himself sliding back putting his back  against the wall of the cell  travis i reach into the bag of holding i pull out the little goblet and i pour some ale  into a cup and i hand him a little bit of ale no its fine i take a little sip  matt please /dung/ dont take offense if i dont trust a drink from strangers whove well to be honest  put me in this position  travis all right i put it beside him  matt what do you want to know  laura we want to know if the briarwoods  sam are vampires  laura pretty much theyre vampires right i mean theyre vampires  matt all i know from the stories ive heard mothers would tell their kids not to wander out at  night because dark things crawl in the shadows from what i know of vampires theyre not /none/ supposed  to go out during the day right but im sure ive seen lady briarwood walk in the sun many a time  marisha only lady briarwood  matt as i recall yes lord briarwood doesnt make too many public appearances  sam have there been any strange goingson in their residence sounds youve heard people  disappearing boxes coming in or out  laura i cast cure wounds on him i know cure wounds bitches level up  orion have i reached the keep yet  matt no not yet youre probably about an hour away at this /none/ point from the time youve taken to  research find this learn the sigil to westruun and begin your trek back fortunately you got  what you wanted but youre out of the picture for a little bit he flinches as you put your hand up  and as you touch him he exhales you get to him just as he can react briefly  laura 11 do i add anything to that  matt i believe you add your wisdom modifier to that  laura 14  matt he goes look my father worked for the de rolo family /none/ before the briarwoods came my father  vanished the night of their fall my mother was taken in madness and lost to the night this past  year i was left alone however i knew the roads well between here and whitestone and places  between growing up traveling with my father so i was made to be a coachman for the new nobles i  was paid albeit little and i was left alone  now when i say the new nobles there were nobles that lived in whitestone and worked along with the  de rolos and they /town/ helped oversee parts of the town the business and the people they had been  there for many generations of their respective families all under the de rolos guidance but  the night the castle fell those nobles were dragged out  its strange i mean after the brutality of that first night it took days before the people of  whitestone knew what had happened we saw the fires we heard the battles but no word of the victors  until three days had passed we were too scared to approach by then the briarwoods called a town  /town/ meeting they explained their new rule over the town a number objected which is expected many  strongwilled folk in whitestone those days they were subsequently shot down at arrowpoint the  rest were quiet  they then dragged out the noble families and executed them gifting their property and titles to the  various cutthroats and mercenaries they had hired brought across the channel to help them  take the town theyre not just two people theyve used a lot of money and influence from wherever  they came from and brought a whole slew of very dastardly folk /none/ who have since been given the  titles once held by the other nobles of whitestone living in their homes taking their  tithes and most of the profits made from the businesses theyve forced us to continue to run from within  the city a number of families fled into the woods the night after the executions using the shadows  of a moonless evening to keep safe they were all found hanging from the sun tree the next morning  they kept things going as they were mostly farming logging manning the white marble mines  business went /none/ as usual all filling the pockets of the new nobles and the briarwoods we were given  food kept our immediate property as long as we didnt attempt to leave we were promised safety  that lasted for a few years until the nobles grew bored twitchy they began to abuse the  people of whitestone scare us for fun brand cut steal the children leave them back  destroyed they treat us like animals folks went missing i was beaten so bad by my employer count  tylieri but lord briarwood noticed one night he was passing through the /none/ city he saw wounds on my  back when he was meeting with count tylieri when he asked me in private how i got them i couldnt  lie couldnt resist him he has a way of drawing the truth out of you now he told me this  unrefined violence was boorish to him and his wife that was the last i ever saw of lord  tylieri  lord and lady briarwood took me in as their own driver and showed me tylieri hanging from that  same sun tree the next morning i was thankful then in /none/ a strange way life had been so terrible  for so long it was the first time i saw someone reach out and save me they took me in as their  driver after that it was a better thing to be away from the anger and the fists of the thugs  but the more i got to know the briarwoods the more nightmarish i realized they were  behind the walls of that castle was no longer a grand fortress that we heard it was seeing it  keeping watch and guard over our people no that was /dung/ a domain of perverse magics and sacrilege it was the  green fog drifting out from the ground where it stood the same servants still run the halls but  they arent living theyre walking vessels of undeath their flesh slowly tearing away the  garden in back lies shriveled a foul green mist forever pouring out theyre excavating something  in the dungeon plundering pieces a lot of their attention seems to be down there i dont know  why i dare not wander too far down they bring up old things ancient things relics books bones  you /none/ live in that world long enough you believe there is no way out death would be easy though  ive seen that death is no real end there its just the beginning of a whole new terrible  existence a far worse fate  laura if we keep you here protected would you be willing to tell your story to someone else  matt who would you want me to tell it to  laura the emperor the guards here an army that could go and fight the briarwoods  matt maybe  marisha this could be an option to /none/ save whitestone and you would have your freedom  matt i dont know you dont know what its like you dont know what theyve done theyre  going to find me  sam we can protect you we are safe here in this keep and youre surrounded by very powerful  allies now  travis weve stood before them and we did not fall  laura its true  matt ill think about it  marisha would you like to stay in the guest room upstairs youd be more comfortable you could get  a good nights rest  laura /none/ far more comfortable a little less safe im going to put it out there  matt that resonates with him immediately and his eyes flash open i mean no disrespect but if  this is safe then id rather stay here  laura i think it is and we will bring a bed down to you make sure youre comfortable i dont want  you sleeping on the floor thats terrible  matt youre all being very accommodating  travis youll get every consideration for protection we value your info very much  marisha youre also the key to our /none/ own freedom so its important  sam you also caught us on a day where were trying to be nicer to people  laughter  sam lucky for you  liam just be glad youre not an old woman  matt ill stay here for now  laura all right  matt i need to think on it ive been promised such protection before  sam from the briarwoods  matt from a few and theyre dead an enemy of an enemy doesnt necessarily make them a friend  ive discovered  marisha no but it can make them allies /none/ if they have mutual enemies of their enemies its a  little complicated  matt this whole conversation the emotional recalling of everything you can see has been very  taxing on him and his still mostly conscious state he looks exhausted scared and still  trying to suss out all the information coming at him right now  marisha grog why dont you carry the bed down from upstairs  travis not a problem keep the goblet nearby it is very nice ale  marisha would you like something to eat  matt yes please  marisha well have /none/ our staff bring down some food  matt he takes the goblet he looks at it smells it but still holds it at bay as you walk off you  eventually go easy enough for you take the bed you have to turn it to the side to take it  out which causes all of the cushions to fall out  travis aw shit  laughter  travis i grab a little pillow with my toes and i hobble down  matt it takes about 20 minutes and three trips but you manage to get the bed down there /none/ from the  guest room  travis not a problem  matt when you fit it in the cell and its not a large cell its maybe ten by ten feet maximum  you place it there as you guys walk back you notice as you see grog walking back down the  stairway right around the corner as you go down the steps the hallway goes to the cell and it  turns to the right and to the left to the workshop you see around the corner a shoulder  listening in theres a person and you recognize /none/ that it is percy percy has stepped out of the  workshop and apparently has been hearing everything this entire time  laura are you all right  matt im fine and percy immediately steps away and you hear the door close with a slam  laura give him time  sam so moody  laura so yeah im going to lock it im just going to lock your door to make sure youre safe  make sure nobody can get in  matt keep him away from me who is that  sam hes a friend i know it /tavern/ doesnt seem like it from the condition of your paw but hes a friend  hes in the same boat as you trying to stay safe from danger  laura the briarwoods destroyed his family as well  matt and you see now theres like this look of tension on his face thats mixed with tired and  eventually finding the bed and takes the goblet still filled has not drunk from it just slips it  next to the side of the bed eventually food is brought down  laura and a chamber pot because come on  matt /none/ all the basic pleasantries are brought within the cell he lies on the bed and takes the  plate up with him and starts just scarfing some of the bread rolls down and immediately starts going  for the mashed potatoes you can see a decent meal hasnt been had in quite a while especially the  journey what is essentially a seven to eight day journey from whitestone probably has not been  very kind to him eats and then promptly passes out on the bed food still mashed on the side of  the face just goes straight /none/ into a slumber  travis is there any other entrance to the cell area besides the door no barred windows or  anything like that  matt no its underground its all solid solid stone walls and there is the barred front door  and then just goes right into the hallway that goes up the stairs to your left and across the way  and around the corner to the workshop  travis you cant cast any kind of alarm system a trigger  laura so that percy cant get anything through there  marisha let me reference my /none/ spell tome its not a common one its situational but let me check  real quick i havent read that chapter from my book in a while  orion is allura on the way back from the lyceum  matt no the lyceum is in the erudite district alluras tower is in the cloudtop which is the  central part of emon  laura i do want to go check out that bird creature at the farmhouse tonight  sam yes well have we stationed a guard down there  travis we should we have five or six  sam /none/ all right ill go talk to cordell thats his name right  travis no not cordell lets get somebody else  laura get the crossbow guy that we like so much the guy thats the captain of the guards  sam is that kendrick or shayne oh the girl  laura no the guy hes awesome and hes an archer as well  sam jarett  laura jarett thats it  sam all right well get jarett oh jarett  matt you make your way to the back part of the wall and there is a small tower thats  /none/ constructed as part of the back wall thats where jarett usually keeps watch jarett has the  inbetween shift between the guards so he can be present for both sides and keep a watch during the  afternoon until the nighttime probably till about midnight or so so as you make your way out of the  keep tiberius are you heading back to the keep or are you heading toward the cloudtop district  this will dictate whether or not you show up around this time  orion im going to alluras  laura im staying down in the /none/ prison just for the time being i dont want to leave him alone  with percy  matt you go to find jarett whos up at the top of the tower and as you call to him jarett leans  over and you see him you know short jetblack hair darker complexion very handsome younger  earlytwenties guy welldressed over his studded leather armor that he wears underneath and has the  crossbow on the side he leans over scanlan it has been some time it is so good to hear from  you what can i be of service /none/ for  sam we need you to watch a prisoner for us downstairs in our jail cell which we had built  and are now using youll be guarding the prisoner to make sure he doesnt escape but also making  sure he stays safe he possesses information thats very valuable to us and one of the people  who hires you might try to kill him so if percy tries to go in there can you stop him without  hurting either party  matt i imagine this would be very wellsuited for my skill set it will be /none/ strange to keep watch  against one of my employers but hes been a bit sheepish around me anyway  sam you think you could take percy  matt well i think i can at least talk some sense into him  travis i like him  sam wow jarett youre ballsy just out of curiosity if he was running at you what would  you do  laughter  matt well first and foremost i would dive in the forward motion leg out to put him off  balance this would be from a frontal melee youre messing with /none/ me arent you  sam a little bit  matt ah gnomes very well  sam do you need anything to help  matt i have access to my own private armory and i have utmost faith  sam all right well keep him safe and theres an extra five gold in it for you  laura oh pathetic  sam i dont know ten ten gold  matt gnomes  sam i dont know how money works well talk to vex about it  matt certainly all right i will do this and he stands up and goes and /none/ starts gathering his  general setup supplies inside the guard tower as you walk back to the keep you hear him whistle  and start calling out to shayne to go ahead and take over up in the tower  liam i wasnt there for any of that i was upstairs on the roof just thinking  matt tiberius you make your way into the cloudtop district as you come to the front gates  of the district the guards that normally recognize you and welcome you in recognize you  and stand firm weapons at the ready  orion /none/ at alluras tower  matt at the cloudtop district entirely you guys had to get written permission to enter there when  you first came to emon anyway since thats where the nobility and many of the important figures of  emon reside it appears that since youve been taken out of the council and youre under  investigation your access to such a sensitive location within emon has been temporarily revoked  and the guards are not letting you through  orion is that it so i just turn around go back  matt its up to you the /none/ guards are just there standing  orion greeting and salutations im tiberius stormwind from draconia moreover a member of vox  machina over at greyskull keep it seems that you all are posturing and whatnot chuckles its  adorable but im here to see lady allura could you let her know that i would like to speak to  her or get out of my way so i can just go over there and tell her myself  matt we have direct orders to not let you or any other member of vox machina into the cloudtop  district until /none/ your investigation is complete so no and no  orion well do the second thing if you dont do one thing do one of the other things  matt your information and wish has been processed taken into consideration thank you  very much please be on your way  orion oh it has been it has been processed oh thats good to know i appreciate that very well  i cast fly on myself and i go back to the keep  matt okay whoosh they both did not expect that exit you essentially supermaned youre just  like /dung/ thud little cloud of smoke in the shape of a dragonborn left behind all right so as you  cruise over you see in the distance from where youre standing at the top of the keep you see a  distant bead of dark shadow that approaches and grows larger and it is an aircruising tiberius  making his way towards the keep  liam i hide behind i dont want to get hit so im going to crouch down a little bit carefully  behind one of the pieces of wall yeah rough landings sometimes  orion i fly /none/ in vox machina  liam easy be careful  orion sorry hi what are you doing are you up here thinking  liam why i suppose i was the others are downstairs interrogating that boy where have you  been  orion off doing things that wasnt really that productive overall but they dont like me  anywhere especially now  liam do you want to have a drink  orion yes actually i do  liam ive got a flask you normally drink water you want a shot though  orion yes i would love some alcohol this calls /none/ for alcohol  liam i pull out my flask and im amazed because ive never seen this and i hand it over to him  orion oh yes whoosh  sam did you eat the flask  orion no fire breath  liam do you want to pass that bad boy back is it hot  matt its empty  liam oh its empty well i guess that was worth it  orion slurred what what are you talking about dont you tell me how to drink oh you  travis i come out from the castle into the courtyard /tavern/ and i go hey i feel like chicken  tonight can we go hunt this big bird  liam tiberius i just got him drunk  travis really  orion slurred he gave me a shot of his flask water and its so good  travis are you sure you didnt hit him with the blunt side of your knife again  liam no no he took a shot of the old firewater and i dont know we might want to slap him a  bit  orion slurred allura doesnt like me anymore because i killed that bitch who /none/ tried to kill us  and now shes fucking nobody likes us  liam lets find keyleth  travis yeah smart keyleth  marisha what i was reading what  travis tibs got turnt up will you fix it  marisha how  orion vax gave me  marisha what did you do why are you touching me  orion oh i love protecting you it is and lockheed is he loves you too  marisha dont touch me right now  orion see im telling you nobody likes me  liam i gave him his first drinky im sorry /none/ do you think you could pull him out of it  marisha what  liam i thought he was going to say no he didnt leave me any  orion its good hi how are you im tiberius draconia you are princess pretty face he likes  you too  liam vax walks away off the roof out of here im gone  travis grog is riveted  orion human kissy mouth with you is vomits  laughter  orion im good  marisha if you touch me one more time  orion oh sorry did you need to go /tavern/ somewhere  marisha i am doing something else a request that was already made previously before can we fix  drunk tiberius so im a little busy why dont you go sleep it off take a nap and i will deal  with you in a second  orion is it sleepy time  marisha for you  orion should i cast fireball  marisha oh my god and i shove him into the cell and put him in bed  travis no were not in the prison were out in the courtyard  marisha oh i thought that you /none/ said everyone was like keyleth  laura im still in the prison everybody else is out of the prison  matt so where do you push him  orion she pushed me off the roof  marisha no i thought we were downstairs  orion i fall off the roof i still have fly on myself dont i  marisha you dont fall off the roof i dont know what i do with him i let him pass out  orion im going to get a sandwich  marisha i let him go get a sandwich  sam i encourage /none/ sandwich  laughter  matt thats the quote of the night encouraged to get a sandwich tiberius wanders off what are you  doing to prepare what you were doing  marisha i dont know i got distracted  orion im not there  marisha okay  matt well as the day progresses what would you guys like to do  marisha wait my idea okay we were wanting extra fortification we were wanting extra  protection okay i cant necessarily cast a big spell i could cast hallucinatory terrain we have  a few options im giving them to /tavern/ you all i can cast hallucinatory terrain to make this look like  something else i dont think i dont know i dont know if thats a good idea i dont know i  could conjure a few woodland beings for like extra bears we could have some bears guarding the  palace i could also throw up a wall of thorns to barrier the cell with the wall of thorns youre  not here  sam i think everyone left i think its just you and me up here and drunk tiberius  marisha i went downstairs and im /none/ saying this to the group so i dont have to repeat myself  orion oh so then i turn around with my sandwich and am like we have to just make allura talk to  us she can fix everything  travis i grab tiberiuss mouth and i cover it please continue  sam wall of thorns could be good  laura i like wall of thorns  marisha the thing with wall of thorns is its not super big its 60 feet  sam thats pretty big  laura oh thats not the whole place though  sam oh /none/ 60 feet long i thought you meant high  marisha no its 100 feet high its really high actually i dont know how high it is dont quote  me on that but its not that long but we could fortify the doors more have bears we could do  multiple things too  liam i think that the hallucinatory terrain wouldnt work i felt like they could see right  through me  travis i think so too  marisha on the briarwoods  laura yeah they can see through illusions pretty darn well  sam listen percys here /none/ he can defend for us  orion no you need a warding spell  sam why dont we just leave someone behind  marisha percys behind  travis percys here and so are five six how many employees do we have  laura our very capable guards  travis why dont you make some extra bears that dont hate us  marisha huh  travis why dont you make some extra bears that dont hate us  marisha all right ill make some extra bears  orion put some little hats on them and make them cute  liam do /none/ you think you could fix him because hes a lot of firepower if were going to go  marisha what gets rid of drunkenness laughs  laura maybe restoration  matt restoration would probably take care of it  marisha i dont want to burn a restoration spell on your drunkenness  laura can you cast little restoration  matt you could also just give it a couple of hours drink a lot of water  travis what time is it  matt at this point its probably close to 300 in the afternoon  travis so its 300 in /none/ the afternoon the bird doesnt even come until night we could let him  wear it off  marisha what time is it  sam 300 we just established this were going to wait until night and go  laura she said she hated you how did that feel  liam fine that was fine that was the heat of the moment she was angry were a team  matt all right whats the plan guys  sam the plan is were going to let him sober up were going to give him some coffee and then  were going /none/ to set off for the north farmlands at dusk  orion oh we should get some corn and other harvestments at the farms  marisha i make an army of bears  matt  okay this concentration will last an hour  laura oh thats it  matt the conjure woodland beings  marisha wait no hang on what if i conjure a bear and then let me make sure while they  figure their stuff out see were all figuring stuff out  laura what if i leave trinket in the prison with jarett  travis yeah that wont freak /none/ him out at all  sam well with cordell jaretts down in the cell this is defense against invading vampires  marisha okay i have a better idea  travis yep  sam oh my god  marisha why dont i conjure an elemental and then i can cast planar binding on him and hell  hang out for 24 hours  sam great do it make it done lets go kill a bird  travis lead with that next time  marisha i was figuring it out its new  sam youve got to talk it through  marisha /tavern/ figuring it out  travis thats awesome  matt yep thatll do  travis dont vampires hate fire can you do fire  laura yeah fire fire elemental  liam running water  laura ooh water elemental gasps tiberius remember that you  travis hes drunk  laura i know  sam dont talk to him  travis he wont remember anything  orion slurred i love how you shoot arrows at things eyeballs  sam i use minor illusion to create lockheed and i have him scamper away  orion oh thats you but where are you going you /none/ go play up there tell your brother to be good  anyway youre so pretty  matt so are you doing that marisha keyleth are you summoning an elemental  marisha yes  matt okay which kind  marisha water elemental  matt okay and you cast planar binding part of the material component cost is a gem thats worth  at least 1000 gold pieces  travis i have one of those  laura you do  travis yeah its a jewel thats red and palmsized  laura i have a diamond of awesome and a regular diamond as /none/ well  liam if i create a trap here can you bind some magic to it  orion you can do anything with magic you can make things go you can make things stop  travis i cover tiberiuss mouth again  laura i give her a diamond  matt all right is this the awesome diamond or the regular diamond  laura this is a regular diamond the awesome diamond is special  matt all right  laura no dont do that  marisha i know why do you do that  laura diamonds are really expensive any diamonds /none/  marisha i know and an awesome diamond has got to be more than 1000 so this time theres got to be  at least 1000 grog what kind of jewel do you have  travis its a palmsized ruby  marisha a palmsized ruby  travis yeah i got a big palm  marisha tiberius  sam no just dont  matt vex your keen eye is able to ascertain that the palmsized ruby is worth roughly 1200 gold  pieces and would be suitable for this ritual  laura i think we should use the ruby because i /none/ have an eye for these things  travis do we think theyre going to come while we do this do we want to waste it because thats an  awesome outside defense do we want to waste it for this what if theyre coming does it cost one  jewel per  matt yeah  travis maybe we should save that because thats awesome  liam is there a possibility dm that i could if hes sobered up if i set a trap that a spell  of his could be bound to it somehow and go off i have /none/ no idea  matt its hard to say there are certain spells that can enable that that can take certain spells  that trigger at a certain time nothing thats particularly in your guys realm of experience or  understanding though unfortunately  liam all right so i can look into it for the future but not today  travis keyleth i like that i think we should keep it in case there is an actual attack coming  because it might just 24 hours and then we waste it nobody came  marisha thats true to be fair the /none/ castles being heavily watched by outsiders as well  sam okay listen lets just go  orion grog is big scanlans small everything is great hi  liam can we leave trinket to watch  laura what hes going to go down in the prison with jarett  matt okay you bring trinket down trinket stands watch right in the center plops down right up  against the bars  laura i knock on percys door and say percy  matt yes  laura trinkets out here if you need anything you just come out and you pet him  /none/ matt thank you  laura welcome  orion i also go up to the door and go trinket mumbling percy  laura arent you sober yet  orion no its been like five minutes hasnt it  matt yeah over time over the next two to three hours or so you guys have set up a place to go  they have given you some water and youve managed to sober up a bit  liam i actually picked his pocket and took his bottle of endless water dont you have a bottle  of water like that  matt /none/ no that is currently left to be blessed for holy water  liam oh oh well  travis and we take the scenic route to let him walk it off as we head up towards big birds  house  sam great  matt all right so you guys make your way around the outskirts of emon under moonlight its a  threequarter waxing moon you make your way to the farm vicinity on the north side of the city  it doesnt take long for you to eventually suss out the house that matches the description that  you /none/ were given by the klauses you knock on the door and they eagerly greet your arrival and  invite you in so glad you all could make it have you decided have you given our communitys  request some thought  sam were here to help were the heroes that you asked for  travis we love old people  matt thank you thats really good of you we will happily provide you with fresh produce going  forward weve talked to a few of the members of the community and were going to make sure thats  taken care /none/ of  sam where do you think we should stake out this bird where are your livestock kept  matt the livestock are kept on the eastern side of this community if you look about say about  half a mile out to where the actual residences stop being clustered together youll see there  are a number of large livestock containment areas hard to miss out there we have pens for sheep we  have pens for cows we have pens for horses other beasts of burden that whole vicinity is where  most of these attacks seem to /none/ be coming so thats probably your best bet there  liam and the biggest you have are the bulls you said  matt bulls we have a few big cows as well weve lost a few of them unfortunately  travis thatll be all we need  laura can one of us polymorph into a giant cow  sam sure  marisha i could also talk to cows again maybe these cows will know something  travis we head out to the pasture  marisha first can i ask her you said your neighbor boy kyle  sam kyle the /none/ neighbor boy the neighbor boys son yes  matt thats true kyles the one who originally spotted it yeah  marisha where does he live  matt hes actually the son of the man who runs most of the livestock areas over there you can go  and head over there hes probably still up keeping his eye out in case it comes back  marisha thank you i go to kyle  matt okay you guys make your way over there its easy to find theres large pens you can see  that for as big as the pens /none/ are built and their structure they are noticeably dwindled you can  see why theres been some worry in the community here the fact that its only been two weeks and  this many creatures are gone is a little disconcerting as you get there you can see the  house has its light on there are glowing windows and sitting in a chair holding a crossbow across  his lap you see a 19yearold boy rugged chin growth dirty red hair thats disheveled and hes  sitting there looking around in the sky rocking back and forth in his /none/ chair as you approach who  goes there  sam dont worry were friends were friends of the klauses mr and mrs klaus  matt okay okay so you the ones they say was coming to help  marisha yes  travis aye  laura we hear you have a keen eye kyle  matt ive seen some things yeah  sam where have they been attacking lately  matt points to the whole area in front of him and says are you keeping watch now great thank  you  marisha no wait dont leave yet we need you /none/  orion yes yes keyleth we are vox machina over from greyskull keep im tiberius stormwind  marisha thats irrelevant the point is i was wondering if you had any more information about  the creature  matt i mean other than the fact that it was just a really big bird really big huge  marisha do you remember any other details any other defining details other than bird  matt its hard to see in the moonlight  sam when it picks up a cow or whatever its been picking up does it strike with the beak or /dung/ the  claws the talons  matt claws and sometimes it takes two at a time one in each claw and just carries them  away   orion have you seen any of its droppings anywhere  matt no   travis have you managed to hit it with your crossbow  matt ive missed  liam and youre certain this is a feathered beast or no  matt best i can see its dark out here at that time of night and it looks like a bird it doesnt  make any noise and swoops on down and /none/ takes them away and flies off in that direction  travis ive heard that those giant birds are attracted to redheaded 19yearold scruffychin  folk with crossbows  matt make an intimidation check  travis awesome  matt this would be with your charisma  travis 22  matt nice he goes well i dont want to be here then you guys can keep an eye out ive got  to go and unloads the bolt in the crossbow slings it up under his arm  sam wait before you leave im sorry i have an itch and it can /none/ only be scratched with a cowbell  do you have a cowbell anywhere around here i just need a cowbell can i borrow a cowbell from you  matt your kids weird and he keeps walking  marisha your kid is weird  sam im not a child  laura do i see any cowbells on the ground  matt you can take a glance about you eventually can see that there is set up on one of the fences  that fences in the cows there is a cowbell yes  laura hey theres a cowbell scanlan  sam /none/ great it will help the ruse heres my plan were all cows is that an okay plan  laura i like it  marisha im into this plan but doesnt that essentially make us the bait  sam yes were our own bait are you cool with that  laura should one of us maybe not be a cow  marisha well heres the thing maybe a few of us should not be cows because only a few people are  going to have the ability to turn out of being a cow once they are a cow unless they /none/ take damage  travis we went from all cows to pretty much no one is a cow  laura no keyleth is definitely a cow no i mean i didnt we didnt mean like that youre  very lovely  marisha its okay what vax said was way worse earlier  travis how do you come out of being a cow if you are one  sam i can get rid of it  travis you would do it lets do it when else are we all going to be cows come on unless it  kills them instantly well /none/ be fine  orion im fine i go invisible  matt okay  laura im going to lay in wait with an arrow all the rest of you can be cows  liam i think im better served waiting to strike  sam you and me grog were cows  liam if it grabs one of them ill deal more damage if it grabs me ill deal no damage but  if it grabs scanlan cow i can  marisha another thing is i can turn into a cow i can turn someone else into a cow well  polymorph /none/ is a concentration spell  sam i can turn us all into cows  marisha oh because you got that thing  travis cow or no keyleth give us your answer  marisha oh im a cow  sam seeming  orion oh we are not actually cows  sam well just seem like cows  marisha except for me who is going to be an actual cow  orion if its polymorph i couldnt cast stuff i redact my invisibility and ill be a cow im also  going to be a cow i want to be a brown /none/ cow  marisha were all cows just embrace it  matt you cant change a targets body type  sam what no  matt so the same form of your limbs youre right  sam you cant change size but we can all be grogsized cows or scanlansized cows  matt its going to be an array of very strangely sized cows  marisha scanlan would be like a calf big calf  sam what do you think  matt and sam ill allow it  cheering and laughter  sam gather close to me  travis we want to /none/ get in the pen first right  sam yes lets go into the pen and if i may im going to wear the cow bell  travis sure youve earned it  laughter  laura how you going to put it im just going to put it around your neck right now  travis super loose  matt you guys make your way into the cow pen the little bit of moonlight thats coming down from  the sky illuminates you see the cows are clustered underneath this overhang that is used  for temporary shelter you hear this distant /none/ mooing as you approach and make noise no ones  not too upset yet its more low muttering  travis what if that was attraction  matt not yet  marisha if we use seeming we just appear to be cows but we can still speak right  matt yeah anything sees you as cows  marisha would be like holy shit those are talking cows  sam its cowmooflage  groaning  sam thank you  orion thats good  matt i have to give you experience for that  laughter  liam wait whats going on are we /none/ turning into cows  sam we just will seem like cows  liam i dont understand magic  travis just go along go along  laura that way we can ambush the bird  marisha we are going to look like cows are we going to look like cows to each other too  matt youll find out  marisha okay  matt as you all gather around the small gnome currently adorned with the cowbell around his  neck  liam just like the brothels eh  matt you complete the spell and with a sudden whoosh of cold /none/ night air your vision blurs and  you blink for a second you look around and vox machina is now instead an array of slightly  smaller than average cows  mooing  sam barks oh wait no  matt youre by the way more of a calf  laura you are so cute scanlan  marisha okay shall we go interview some cows  laura lets go talk to some cows i want to walk over to the cows with you  matt you guys step up awkwardly towards the cows some of which are sleeping some of which /none/  are noticing and sitting there just chewing  marisha which one looks like the alpha male  laura the one thats got horns  matt there are no males in this pen because they are cows  orion i try to speak to the cow  matt okay what do you say  orion hello im tiberius stormwind from draconia  matt you speak common you dont know cow  marisha tiberius just because you look like a cow doesnt mean you can talk to the cows the  cows dont understand english no matter if you look like /none/ a cow they still dont understand  common  liam boy if uriel could see us now  laughter  travis we are cownsel worthy  marisha i cast speak with animals  matt this is the best vox machina adventure ever all right you cast speak with animals  marisha yes actually how many animals can i hit with speak with animals it is called animals  right or is it just speak with animal  matt i think it affects you i think it gives you the ability to speak with  marisha oh just me the ability /none/  orion youre dr doolittle  marisha oh yeah i think youre right okay so i cast speak with animals on myself  matt all right yep on self for ten minutes  orion make sure the cow what she may know a cow that is over there  marisha okay so i go up is there a cluster of nicelooking ladies sitting around  matt all the cows are clustered in this one corner up against each other for body warmth  and there are few that are just like moo  marisha hello ladies good evening  matt /none/ moo which is what you guys hear you hear as a response what are you doing were trying  to sleep  marisha i do apologize to awaken you i was just curious if you could tell me a little bit about  some of the events that have been transpiring around here lately mainly the results of your  kind getting killed  matt my kind  orion just ask about the bird  marisha have you seen a giant bird flying around anyone  matt at which point all the cows start shuddering and say yes havent you /none/ it keeps taking us why do  you think were hiding under this  marisha oh sure  matt be careful if you stay out there itll see you  marisha right where exactly where have they been okay damn cows its never  sam keyleth what vital information have you learned  marisha ill get back to you in one second can you tell me anything about what it looks like  matt its big and has wings its fast and it keeps taking us  orion ask her where the moon is at night  marisha does it /dung/ seem to come at a certain time of the night  matt the dark time  orion its a cow this is the same as before  travis because nothing is happening i am now trying to eat grass  matt you bend down and take clusters with your hand and start eating grass  orion oh we are ourselves still  matt yeah you are not actually physically cows you are still yourselves you just look like  cows  sam i for once and its not weird i just shit on the floor  laughter  sam seems /none/ totally normal  travis we are in it baby  laura im just going to notch a bow to my bow just to keep a lookout to the sky  matt okay  orion can i prestidigitate smells  matt you could  orion sweet go ahead  laughter  sam all right so we go out into the field  marisha theyre cows i forgot that talking to cows never goes well  laura yeah remember dork  marisha didnt seem to know a lot theyre simpleminded beasts  laura dork the ox  marisha yeah poor dork dork /none/ the ox  matt rest in peace dork  travis pour a little out  matt you guys make your way you wait a while a good twohour period as cows before eventually  you keeping your eye to the sky with your arrow nocked see a whisk of shadow across the moonlight  laura whistles  travis what was that  laura im letting you guys fucking know theres a thing in the sky  orion is it jumanji time  sam not quite  matt at this point you guys look up and you see something circle once /none/ it looks like a bird its  just not as big as you were expecting looks like a bigger hawk  orion i cast stoneskin on myself  matt okay bigger and bigger  liam my cow is going stealth  matt roll for cow stealth  laughter  liam 23  matt okay youre still a cow  marisha i make myself look available i step away from the rest of the herd a little bit  travis i go into a cow rage and start chewing faster  matt you would like to chew all right  laura /none/ i hunters mark it  matt okay well it has to come within range first  laura as soon as it is  matt as it swoops down you see this bird just gets larger and larger and you realize it was  quite a distance away and now that its getting closer the tales youve heard are true this is  at least a 100foot wing span if not more  orion im going to fix my ring on it  marisha 100foot wing span  orion as it gets close im going to brace my ring as its /none/ coming towards us  matt okay it comes it dives down with extreme speed and goes into a dive it comes into range  you cast hunters mark on it you have your ring ready what you doing  orion cast slow on it  matt cast slow all righty what is the dc on that  orion 17  matt and what is the save  sam is it wisdom or charisma or something  orion its concentration no wait it is a concentration  matt yes it is thats okay im finding it all right it is wisdom /none/ all right oh what was the  dc  orion 17  matt 17 that is an 18 rolled a natural 18 on that one as it swoops down you release the spell  you are immediately attempting to be grasped in its talons that is a 23 to hit  marisha that hits  matt all right so you then take 23 points of slashing damage to your cow form  laura i thought we were just  matt oh okay sorry youre not in cow form are you youre illusioned youre staying normal  marisha no im normal /none/  matt youre normal right okay i thought you were saying you were doing an actual cow form but  no all right you take 23 points of slashing damage and you are currently grappled as it takes  right back up into the air clutching keyleth within its talons  liam how fast can the rest of us do anything its gone  matt now you guys can react it is currently 60 feet away from you  laura i immediately oh god i shoot it  sam do we have to roll for initiative  matt you do /none/  laura but i was notched already  matt right ill give you advantage on your initiative because youre notched but you used  your last turn to cast hunters mark on it everyone roll initiative you have advantage on it  because you were nocked and because you were ready to react you have advantage on your  initiative check but everyone else just roll normally all right so that is 25 to 20  laura 21  matt 21  matt 20 to 15  liam 17  travis 18  marisha 16  matt vax keyleth scanlan /none/ tiberius what you guys got  sam six  orion five  matt okay all right so vex youre up first  laura im going to shoot it through the blazing bowstring  matt okay go for it roll for the attack  laura 16  matt 16 hits  laura counts quietly 26  matt 26 points of damage all righty  laura and then im going to shoot it again  matt go for it  laura that one definitely hits 26  matt yeah that hits  laura 26 again  matt nice all right that brings /dung/ us to grog  travis i take the firebrand warhammer activate it turn on the fire and i put the chain of  returning on it and throw it at the winged beast  matt okay go ahead and roll with disadvantage because its already roughly 40 to 60 feet away  from you its tough to get there but you can try  travis 15 nope 16  matt okay due to its distance and the dark cover of night its harder to hit and you actually  swing and throw it and the hammer the chain goes taut /none/ and it just drops to the ground and its just  out of range of the hammer as it escapes the range it would have hit it with  travis can i pull it back  matt yeah go for it thats easy enough its not wedged in anything you dont have to roll  for it all right so thats your turn vax  liam id like to use a bonus action to click boots of haste together and i think if i do that  i have two actions at that point right  matt no well you /none/ do have an additional action that can be used only to attack  liam just attack so what i want to do is click the boots of haste together use the original  action to run as far as i can towards the bird and then use my final action to sneak attack the  thing since its got keyleth in its talons thats up to you  matt okay the sneak attack will not kick in because keyleth is not threatening the creature  but you go for the attacks you rush up you dash you get underneath it /none/ for a moment because of  the boots of haste you keep speed with this giant darting creature you underneath throw  your daggers upward  liam all right it would just be one i mean if i use the dash to run as far as i can that would  leave me with one attack probably  matt one attack and your bonus without the damage bonus  liam im trying to be a boy scout here wouldnt the boots of haste clicking be the bonus action  yeah that is 22 to hit  matt that hits  /dung/ liam all right and thats not a whole lot  matt whats the range increment on a dagger  liam thats ten ten  matt ten  liam yeah  matt dagger roll again for disadvantage because its just within your secondary throwing range  liam oh yeah then i missed  matt okay it vanishes into the dark night ahead of you so yeah that is gone you still have your  belt of returning you just dont have your snake belt yeah dont worry guys i saw the look on  your face and im like no its /none/ fine it comes back okay keyleth youre up youre currently  grappled and held within the talons of this giant bird you see the entire ground below you  marisha judging by the fairly close up appearance i have of him at this point can i tell it is  probably a beast nature  matt at the sheer size its hard to tell youve never encountered a beast of this size but you do  look up and you can see the talons that are currently holding you in place and piercing the  sides of your armor are /dung/ birdlike talons and you do see a series of dark feathers coating the  entire underbelly of this entity  marisha okay im going to attempt to cast dominate beast  matt okay all right  marisha it has to make a wisdom saving throw  matt okay  laura is your enhance ability still active from before  matt thats for ability checks so you finish casting the spell apparently this entity is not  affected by the spell  liam fucksticks  sam its not a beast  matt it is not a beast theres a fine line /none/ when certain creatures of nature are altered by some  sort of magical essence or their nature perhaps is not natural at the getgo either they were  created or over time they became something beyond beast this seems to fall under that category  marisha thats my turn right  matt thats your turn that brings us to its turn  marisha can i try and break the grapple as a bonus action  matt that would be your action to try and break the grapple for this creatures turn it does a  full double dash of its /dung/ full flight speed and is about 250 feet away from you and completely out of  your guys reach you see it whoosh up into the sky disappearing to the north northnorthwest  area beyond emon carrying keyleth in its claws  liam keyleth just get out of its fucking hands and fall you can change well catch you well  do something just fall  matt youre close enough where you can still hear this as the desperation kicks in and you  realize seeing your whole party not even visible at this point except a couple of dark /none/ dots in the  low light of the night  sam is it our turn yet  matt it now comes to scanlans turn  sam okay i dimension door  matt whats the range on dimension door  sam 500 feet  matt you and appear where where do you want to appear  sam on it on its back  matt okay you appear right on its back you immediately land and start sliding back as the  wind is pushing on you the feathers themselves due to the aerodynamic nature of its flight path  its a /none/ lot of wind resistance against you  liam oh make an acrobatics check  orion shush what the hell  matt no i was going there dont worry thats what it is you need to go ahead and make an  acrobatics check to see if you can maintain balance on the back of this beast  liam my intelligence is not six  sam 20  matt you manage to just you tumble backward a little bit you grab a couple of feathers and get  yourself just on the side underneath where the wing meets part of the /none/ upper torso where the wind  resistance is the least amount and you manage to hold on you are now clutching the back of this  giant bird thats your turn  sam okay as my bonus action i will inspire keyleth right shes right next to me  marisha scanlan what the shit  sam singing the way you kick so much ass like nobody else the way you do animal things gets me  overwhelmed you dont know you dont know youre powerful oh thats what makes you powerful  matt due to the wind you dont hear /none/ the last line its too loud around it however you can  take a d10 inspiration dice  laura and marisha yay  liam what a heroic move amazing  matt which for the record this currently right now looks like you see the cow clutched below  and currently there is a cow holding onto this giant bird  sam it lasts eight hours  matt this singing tiny cow you artists out there have fun with this scene  laughter  matt all right that ends your turn tiberius  orion good i drop stoneskin at 5thlevel i /none/ go myself one two three i cast fly on all of us  fly you fools and go right after them  matt all right all of you guys at that point you see tiberius and you all take off after him  liam the cows take off into the night sky  orion shouting fly vox machina moo  marisha vox moochina  booing  matt a squadron of weirdlysized flying cows lit by moonlight chasing after a giant bird i love  dungeons and dragons  laughter  travis what is this  matt whats the flying speed /none/ on fly  orion 60 feet  matt 60 feet cool  orion im going to dash on that  matt yep you guys can go 120 feet every turn it can go 240 two rounds pass before you guys  realize there is no way youre going to catch up with this thing or get even close to it  liam ive got haste  laura ive got hunters mark on it so i can track it  liam double me yo i got haste  matt your haste speed your physical body doesnt affect the fly spell unfortunately /none/  youre only at the speed that the arcane nature of the spell can take you im just saying your  metabolisms real fast your heartbeats hummingbirding it but youre still only going 120  feet so as you guys follow behind you can see now after a while on the edge of the shoreline  not too far from emon maybe what would normally be from horseback or a brisk walk a half days  travel you eventually come upon the there it is you come upon the coastal mountains known as  the shoreline summit its a series /none/ of unusually steep mountain bluffs that hug the coastline  northwest of emon as you get closer and at this point youve lost sight of the bird scanlan i  want you to go ahead and roll an athletics check  sam athletics well that doesnt count thats not good athletics 16  matt 16 okay you still manage to keep hold for the portion of the length of the journey as it  moves and shifts and the wind itself is still blowing in your face though minimized by your  current positioning its a trial to hold onto /none/ this large creature as it makes its wings beat and  just the sheer force of its movement all right so as you get closer to these mountaintops  marisha do i have a turn yet  matt you can go ahead and take your turn now too yes  marisha yeah i cast polymorph on it youre on it  sam dont worry about me  marisha really  sam im fine you never need to worry about me havent you guys learned that by now im fine  marisha out of thematic reasons i also turn him into /none/ a cow  laughter  sam thats amazing  liam is what she cries out heroically  matt okay whats the dc on this  marisha my spell dc 18  matt rolled a one  laughter  sam im a cow on a cow with a cow  matt so this giant flying bird moo and just begins to plummet at an extremely fast speed you  both immediately are released from its grasp scanlan and keyleth both are just falling you  guys dont see this its too far away from you now at this point youre probably /none/ close to about  500 feet in the air  liam yo i heard you liked cows so i gave you some cows with your cow  matt i hope this inspires the next diablo cow level guys you really need to look into this  all right so you guys are now both plummeting and falling at a really really rapid speed  marisha i go eagle form  matt flailing cows you go eagle form youre fine so you go into eagle form thats your  action this turn thats your bonus action because you can do that /none/ as a  marisha as a bonus action  matt eagle form scanlan you plummet full speed on this one you probably have another two rounds  before you impact with something very painful  liam but hes as heavy as a dust mote so he just goes like this all the way down right  marisha i dont think thats how it works  orion no hes a little pebble  marisha i can catch him if you need catched  matt you guys still continue to give chase eventually you see this giant thing just go and  /none/ vanish from sight its just gone it just disappeared  orion i go full gandalf  matt all right  liam never go full gandalf  matt you guys are pushing forward so its now the next round for you guys to react what are you  doing  sam i will become a pterodactyl  matt so youre casting  sam polymorph on myself  matt okay because you are falling and this is a lot of wind im going to have to ask you to make  a concentration check to complete the spell  laura come on /none/ scanlan  matt so go ahead and roll a d20  sam this is a concentration not on holding a spell but on casting it  matt correct because as part of the components of it and maintaining your attention to  the spell  marisha what does he add his spell attack bonus  matt this no this is a d20 and let me make sure yeah its a d20 and then you add your plus  five from your charisma  sam charisma thats a natural 20  cheering  matt with that screeches pterodactyl  liam tables /none/ have turned motherfucker tables have turned  orion youre both flying cows  laura wait was seeming a concentration  orion i think it lasts for like eight hours  laura did it drop are we no longer cows  sam i think so ill check  liam hey youre not a cow anymore  laura oh my god youre not a cow anymore  liam oh awesome  matt you guys keep flying you guys catch yourselves  sam nope not concentration it just lasts for eight hours  matt you guys are all still flying cows youre all /none/ still just a squadron of flying illusory  cows which you guys are both now transformed into an eagle and a pterodactyl but you still look  like cows  laughter  liam as the twins are flying i say hey did you notice we have the same pattern twins  matt about this time you hear a loud impactful boom and theres a cloud of dust partway into  the side of this first bit of mountain range that you come upon a little bit distant from you  guys  laura can i fly down towards it  /none/ matt you start heading in that direction because of the speed it was traveling at and the way it  was carrying at the speed it was going its still ahead of you guys and you see the impact you  hear this loud screeching sound and you see now where there was a little poof of cloud these wings  unfold and flapping make its way back up  orion how far away from it are we  matt you guys right now at the close to six minutes youve been traveling  marisha did it not drop the /none/ cow to 0 hit points  matt all the damage carries over  liam the remainder of that damage went into its hit points  matt you dont know it looks hurt it looks like it wasnt happy about it it continues back up  from you tiberius its probably close to 700 to 800 feet away from you its because of the speed  it was traveling and the speed you guys were following it was gaining on you every single  turn  laura is it flying away from us now  matt its heading up into the /none/ mountain range  liam fly after that motherfucker  laura should we still track it its still nighttime right  matt its still nighttime yeah  orion its only 500 feet away from me right now  matt 600 to 500 feet  orion okay cool well im going for it still  matt what are you doing  laura were all following it  orion where am i its taking off right now and im over here  matt youre back here its now starting to take off and head up towards the top of this mountain  range /none/ that youre just starting to come upon  orion okay if its doing that then ill fucking go higher and try to meet it where its going  matt okay cool the rest of you guys continue to give chase now that its returned to its form it  travels an additional double dash 240 feet as this progresses its far beyond any of you guys  in a matter of seconds  laura is the mountain range really far away  matt no youve just hit the outskirts of the mountain range it got there first you guys just /none/  catch up to where it starts and you see its like now its dodging through the mountains and is  currently no longer in sight there is a little bit of low cloud cover in this area a couple  drift by and cover a couple of the mountains but this little cluster of seaside cliffs and  mountains as you get closer you can see its dotted with high altitude trees theres  precariously perched goats that are sleeping on elements of the sides of this mountain  liam can you track it  laura i can track /none/ it of course  matt so youre keeping your attention on it  laura yes  matt the winds also are pretty strong as you get close to the mountains as you coast around each  you start actually diving into this middle valley area  laura im going to cast pass without a trace on all of us  matt okay  sam does that affect any spells  laura no it just makes us stealth easier  sam it doesnt drop hunters mark  matt is it concentration  laura no its not concentration its an action oh /none/ wait laughs i dont know if i can tell  matt is pass without a trace concentration  laura where does it say it  sam theres a c next to it somewhere  laura oh never mind its a concentration forget it i dont know how these things work yet  sam yeah stick to the bows and arrows  matt traveling through this area you can see the mountains the way that theyre constructed in  this area its not a gradual crag a lot of these are just punched up in the air like whatever  heavy /none/ seismic force that created these initially was very localized and very powerful a lot of the  mountains are spirelike they come up with very sheer sides and you can see why this mountain  range is largely not utilized or traversed or generally spoken of often because its too  dangerous for most average folk to even attempt to climb or use for any good reason the winds are  high and powerful here at the tops as well and as youre flying around the winds blowing across  and you get pushed off your course a little bit /none/ here and there but you still keep up best as  possible you leading the charge over about five minutes of searching through this mountain range  you sense that its movement eventually comes to stop  laura okay  travis theres a nest  sam wait you sense that he came to a stop  laura he came to a stop a little bit ahead of us  sam lets go get him  laura can we all try to stealth in  sam im a pterodactyl so  marisha yeah lets go for the element of surprise well /none/ technically were all still  cows  matt yes and you guys cannot talk because youre actually in creature forms  laura all right well im going to try to stealth mountains are my favored terrain  matt they are do you want to go onto the mountain itself or are you still flying amongst  them  laura oh ill still fly  matt so you would not get the advantage because air is not your favored terrain so everyone who  wishes to go ahead and roll stealth checks  marisha all of us  matt all of /none/ you who wish to try and come at it from a quiet  sam pterodactyl screech  matt what did you roll  liam with advantage i rolled a two  matt okay  liam im not used to being flying really  sam five  orion are we flying anymore  matt you guys are all still flying yeah  orion oh shit okay oh no  marisha 21  travis 14  laura 28  matt yeah so you guys following behind vex many of you clumsily and some of you shouting out to  each other i /none/ think she sees it this way and youre like oh my god you come around this one  bend and you can see one of the larger mountainous spires that has a lot of trees and green growth  towards the top at certain places where the rock juts out and gives a shelf for such greenery to  grow outside of its sheer outside surface you do see a couple of wings fold in against the  moonlight in what looks to be an outcropping and there are multiple layers of rock shelves on the  side of this /none/ mountain and on one of these outcroppings there appears to be some sort of a  nest a cluster of almost like actual trees and pieces of wood that are all jammed into this giant  nest thats nestled against where the shadow and the moonlight are fighting for some sort of visual  on it  travis bigass tree fortress  laura did we just find like a mama bird and baby birds  marisha yeah we did  laura what are we going to do  liam were going to take out the mom and train the babies /none/  sam what are we going to do  liam yeah were going to capture those babies and were going to train them  orion thats a good idea i like that idea  sam like avatar  orion yes  travis you could go in  laura me go in theres a giant fucking nest here i get close to it as close as i feel safe  getting to it  matt you guys all stay back or do you go with her  orion im going to cast greater invisibility on myself and then follow  matt /none/ okay you guys have 12 seconds before you all plummet  orion oh wait no i dont do that damn it i forget were still flying  travis what part of the flying part did you forget  orion i thought wed landed already  matt are you guys all going with vex or are you all staying back and shes going on her own  travis are we going to lose fly or do we keep it  matt are you casting greater invisibility  orion no  matt then no youre fine  liam is it the same /none/ stealth roll or an additional stealth roll to go forward at this point  matt no this was your stealth roll on approaching  liam oh well i mean i knew i rolled shitty  matt you dont know you rolled shitty  travis im going in  matt all right so vex and grog you approach gliding cows drifting through the night sky  laura this is so stupid  travis hoof in hoof  matt okay yeah so you guys all realize you must keep close together to tiberius as you come in  keeping too much of /none/ a distance would be a bad thing you come upon the underneath portion of  this outcropping and you can see within a quick glance go ahead and make a perception check all  of you guys  marisha all of us  matt all of you who are coming up in this cluster  travis three  laura do i get an advantage because were in a mountain environment at all  matt nope actually no because youre seeing things on a mountain i will give you advantage on  this  laura yes  marisha 12  matt /dung/ 12  orion 16  sam nothing  liam 13  laura 12  matt so the highest was  orion 16  matt 16 you got  travis three  matt as you guys all look up its very shadowy over here its hard to see the moonlights in  your eye a little bit and the darkness is so pitch the umbra of this particular shadow is very  dark and crushed you make out in the nest the large bird creature has folded its wings and is  currently leaning down and you see something in the /town/ nest thats much smaller moving up next to it  marisha i dont want to kill a mama  laura but shes killing the farmers stuff  marisha maybe we can transplant her  sam to a wildlife preserve  laura maybe and her babies  marisha capture her and move her away from town  liam that seems complicated  sam are they on the highest peak  matt no theres two other levels up above this this one just is one of the largest outcroppings  sam im going to swoop up over them see if theres any /none/ boulders to drop  matt okay looking over it there are no loose rocks or boulders in fact because of the  construction of these mountains theyre solid spires that jut up and then abruptly end all the  erosion that happens here appears to be gradual enough thats why the sides of the mountains are  so smooth and unclimbable  marisha so theres a sheer peak and theyre nested on the side of it  matt yeah its a sheer peak that rounds off at the very top and there are little outcroppings  that jut out in /none/ places as it goes down but those are more towards the top and as you go down  further as most of the erosion hits the mountain lower and lower it has carved off or destroyed  most of what would have been previous outcroppings or smoothed them over  travis how far away are we now  matt you guys are probably a good 60 or 50 feet if youre trying to get up within range of your  fly right whats the range of on that fly  sam fly oh here  matt i got it no /none/ there is no range on it you just touch them so youre fine yeah as long as  youre concentrating on it youre fine  travis so were within 60 feet  matt well you guys have been keeping a little more of a distance down here however at this  point as you guys are all encroaching and scanlans gone overhead a voice rings out against  the darkness flying cows really i care not for this insolence if youve come to mock me or fight  me do it now or leave this creature alone  laura what /none/ where are you who are you who said that  orion i rolled an arcana check of 17 of my surroundings where its coming from  laura ditto i try to perceive where its coming from  matt okay arcana check theres nothing arcane in nature its not omnipresent or coming from any  certain place there is a direction its coming from which is from the outcropping or nest area  theres nothing arcane in nature to it its in the shadow you cant really see it from this  distance  laura is it in front of us /none/ to the side of us is it coming from where the bird seems to be  matt its coming from where the bird is  liam hes controlling it  marisha i fly over as an eagle  laura you still look like a cow eagle  marisha can we drop seeming  matt its not under your control and you cant talk too  travis okay i yell out youve been stealing the farmers livestock give us a reason not to kill  you  sam thats good thats good diplomacy  orion or i mean moo  matt /none/ okay you guys are all keeping distance from it the voice comes out again your nature  confuses me and your words seem illinformed if youre not going to come to speak of discourse  im going to assume that that youre my enemy  orion then as hes saying that ill approach  matt so tiberius cow goes  orion and as i approach the thing im going to dispel magic on myself  matt okay cool for dispel magic i need you to go ahead just for the sake of this i wont  consider it contested because /none/ youre allies in this thing so you land tiberius form shimmers  and returns back to that of a dragonborn and youre standing there on the precipice go ahead  and roll a perception check  orion what is that 11  matt okay its hard to make out the details but the voice is definitely coming from the nest you  see there is something vaguely humanoid but its hard to make out the shape at this distance with  this low light especially since you arent a darkvisiongifted entity however its close to  this bird creature  /none/ orion im going to say is this big bird thing asleep  matt you will not harm this creature poachers  orion im not trying to harm it at all im just seeing if its fine if we could talk i cant see  anything and i wanted to cast light so i could see something but i dont want to hurt your  birds eyes  matt you can see the birds moving and its looking towards your direction and it has this  like soft snarl  orion so its awake  matt its awake and it looks /none/ hurt the voice is like you come here masqueraded as whatever  manner of beasts that you are  orion cows we were cows  matt after tormenting and severely wounding this beautiful creature  orion we didnt do anything to the creature no we were this creature was stealing the farmers  cows and the farmers were saying youve taken our livestock which is hurting the farm we came  to help them and we posed as cows and then your bird took our  liam while hes blithering can i make an additional cow stealth check  matt /none/ to  liam to come up behind the guy near him not even near him just to get a better vantage point  matt go for it make it with a disadvantage  liam does that cancel out with my advantage from my cloak  laura a cow in a cloak  matt you are a flying cow in the moonlight against an individual that is very aware of your  presence  liam shut up baby i know it  laughter  liam that is good  laura thats 31  liam yeah 31  matt chuckles you stealthily /none/ cow your way up to the side of this precipice seemingly unnoticed  getting a view of this creature now you can see this nest is a cluster of driftwood and chunks of  shipwreck and carts and wagon wheels and whatever pieces of wood have been scavenged from different  time periods some are weathered some are more fresh and trees whole trees that are broken and  shredded have all been cobbled together to make this nest in the center of this im going to  take the intensity down on this a little bit you see there /none/ up against this bird and the bird  itself is twitching and looks like its hurt not deeply hurt but hurt you see a small humanoid  pretty small scanlan small hard to make out details but it is currently in the process of  doing a repeated hand motion and then touching a hand motion and then touching and youve seen  this motion before  liam touching what  matt touching the bird there is a perpetual string of cure wounds being applied to this bird  marisha i also approach and come out of my eagle form /none/  orion light  sam are you landing somewhere  marisha next to tiberius  orion but im going to block it with my hand so its not going to blind the bird  matt okay  as the light picks up you can see the bird turns away for a second and starts to  like flap its wings instinctually and once again seeing it up close this bird is really big the  humanoid entity becomes immediately visible and it is a gnome you can see hes dressed in hides  and roughly crafted leather and furs he has /dung/ tousled greasy black hair that hangs past his  shoulders covering a bedraggled and bearded face holding up his arm and looks thin its covering  the light and hes like you  orion sorry i tried to not blind you it was very dark im sorry hello we mean you no harm  matt the gnome slams this small wooden for lack of a better term a small staff or cane slams it  into the ground with a foot stomp and you can see the gnomes entire body suddenly begin to shift  and change into this dark /none/ gnarledlooking hard surface  liam i whack him in the back of the head  laura no its just barkskin its just defense  matt he doesnt know all right so you cow stealth up to the side of this guy  liam lets get ready to rumble  matt all right go ahead and make an attack  liam i pause  matt you pause you are currently now crouched right behind the edge of this nest and you cant  even actually see the guy anymore because in order to get up there youve come underneath to stay /none/  hidden and youre just there behind  marisha can i see vax  matt no well actually go ahead and roll a perception check is it higher than a 31  marisha is it higher than a 31 no  matt you have no idea where vax is  sam im way up above them still right do i see anything  matt no actually you see theres another section above there it looks like theres nothing  else of interest other than some growth a few bushes and some vines that hang down the side  travis somebody /none/ talk to him before i kill this fucking bird  orion i am talking to him  marisha i land beside tiberius and come out of eagle form tiberius would you please dispel this  cow form from me please thank you  matt okay and with that you cast dispel magic and keyleths form reverts that to keyleth normal  keyleth noncow keyleth the gnome character now has the staff at the back and has a hand in front  and is like panting  marisha are you a druid im also a druid i think our goals might /none/ be aligned  matt really  marisha its okay whats her name  matt this creature has no name to it yet i myself am a protector of the wild as you claim  to be as well i have no tribe but the trees around me i hear the whisper of the wind and it  calls for justice  marisha i can relate to that  matt then why do you follow why do you insist on harming this creature  marisha because we were seeking justice for other people  matt why for the civilized folk of /none/ the city you should know more than most they sit there  taking beautiful creatures of nature making them fat and formless and worth nothing to  slaughter them without life and purpose to their existence  orion the life and purpose of their existence is to keep those other people alive  matt and why is it not the same with this creature if they cannot guard their livestock  why is it not food for this thing as well it is the natural life cycle that theyve removed  themselves from  orion when one has an establishment /none/ when one grows its own crop and one steals something it  is considered a crime  matt well when one is not part of that civilization but the civilization of the world as  a whole which requires hunting for what keeps you alive perhaps that does not sink or hang on my  conscience  orion fair point  marisha lets not let this escalate okay what is your name  matt i was once called byron  marisha vyron  matt byron  marisha byron  matt i have not heard my name nor spoken words for /none/ many years  orion would you not like to be called byron or would you like something else like broy or  bman my names tiberius stormwind from draconia and this is my friend keyleth who is also a  druid and we also have a friend who is a gnome who sings songs and whatnot  matt the bird now looking of much better health than it was when it arrived now flutters its  wings out in a stretching motion and as it does its head glides down and looks right towards you  this giant beak that /none/ looks like it could snap you in two with a single bite  marisha i reach up to it and reach out to pet its beak  matt im going to ask you to make an animal handling check on this just to see where this  goes  marisha okay  sam i gently start swooping down to check on my friends  marisha 19  matt all right the large birdtype creature retracts from your attempted touch and begins to  rear back into the nest in a defensive position doesnt bite your hand off  marisha i /dung/ kneel down a bit produce a few goodberries reach out  sam bye keyleth this is how we lose one of our members feeding a bird  matt the creature leans forward and the giant bird you can see its dark black eyes  staring at you each eye probably about the size of your torso as the giant beak comes down you  can see the moonlight gliding off the smooth exterior of the dark black beak it smells and  you take 27 points of piercing damage as the animal takes the goodberries and almost your  entire /none/ hand with it as well at that size its hard to be gentle  marisha its okay its all right  matt so you retract your hand which is now essentially in many ways bones are broken feels  like theres blood streaming down the side of your hand and dripping  marisha thats a good girl  sam is it  matt swallows  sam is it a good girl  orion im feeding a tiny snack to lockheed  marisha i turn back to byron  sam and say ow  marisha yeah and go that hurt now /none/ please listen to me please please listen to me we did  come here to kill the giant creature  matt i had assumed  marisha but upon seeing the situation upon approach realized the situation and decided  amongst all of us that we did not want to bring such a great creature to its death  matt scanlan youve landed by now a pterodactyl a cowlooking pterodactyl  orion as he swoops ive never seen anything quite like it  matt make a persuasion check  orion im going to aid her too  sam all ive seen /none/ so far is keyleths bloody hand  marisha 20 total  matt you have advantage on this because tiberius is aiding you on this conversation  marisha ill take that 20 total  matt all right he looks at you well shall you leave us then  marisha under one condition  matt theres always a condition you call yourself a druid yet you speak like the civilized  folk i get the feeling that perhaps your connection to nature has not been tended to for  some time  orion no she really knows her stuff i mean we /none/ just fought this fire guy  marisha just because one can appreciate nature does not mean that one cannot also appreciate  humanity  matt well this beautiful creature is the only surviving young of a clutch bred by a majestic  roc high in the cliffkeep mountains its mother now lies dead slain by the brutal giants that  wander those peaks this youngun is all that remains of that clutch and the memory of that  blessed entity  travis thats a youngun  matt this is a young one this new home serves us well abundance of /town/ feed lack of large  predatory creatures i believe this is where well stay  marisha question if this is a young adolescent creature what do you think of the destruction it  could cause once it reaches full adulthood are you okay with having that on your conscience this  creature could result in the lives of many if you relocate out of town just a few miles say like  50 or 100 or so because this things really damn big so im sure its got a pretty big you know  what i mean  orion or /none/ just the other way  marisha i will help you i will personally come with you and tend to their safety and make sure  that their location is proper and safe and handled with respect then you will be out of the  harms of poachers you can live off the land and you can be free and alone  matt do you think we came straight to this mountain range do you think this is the first  nest weve constructed me and this lone survivor have scoured the length of this side of taldorei  this as /none/ far as i can see is the safest its the most ignored by nearby civilization  marisha listen  sam im going to drop seeming and also drop my form of pterodactyl  matt all of you now your forms change as this happens midsentence its noticed immediately by  the gnome druid whos like gasps  marisha yes that is correct listen we are being nice dont think that we will be the first  you will have more people come and hunt you and kill this as this beast continues how long do  you think you can /none/ survive waves of mercenaries coming to try and kill this we are the nice ones  i suggest you heed our warning take our help and save the life of you and your creature in the long  run  matt you have yet to provide a suitable alternative  orion oh i might have an idea  marisha there is an alternative tiberius can tell you of that alternative  orion yes see your creature is rather large and powerful yes you have a rather strong bond with  him which is quite unique with such a unique looking /town/ creature  marisha i was setting you up for an awesome oneliner man you were supposed to be like the  other option is death  liam ask him if hes considered whitestone  orion whitestone yeah well i guess theres a couple of options really theres this town  whitestone thats pretty great and has a lot of livestock that this creature can consume  marisha yeah i dont know about that  matt go ahead and make a deception check  orion that is a 24  matt whitestone how far is this whitestone  marisha wait no /town/ hang on no this is getting out of control already i will not let you all do  this no not today you guys have caused enough problems we are not going to push this creature  on other people im trying all right im working on it i dont want to push this problem  off on a town thats already being held hostage by vampires that fucking sucks thats double  shitting on them  orion well the other option was like i was saying perhaps you can form an agreement with  emon im sure it would /none/ pay in livestock rather well for the protection of you such a powerful  druid over at least a section of the land in exchange for free food for your friend  matt you dragon man are adorably naive of the ways of men and those that lie and deceive i have  yet to have met any civilized people who have kept their word when it came to creatures like this  laura can i come forward all right what about vasselheim not in the city but outside of it  theres plentiful forests tons of giant creatures it /none/ could feed on  orion thats right thats true  marisha that actually is fairly true  laura theres so many monsters out there they dont hunt them all because theres too many  orion thats a wonderful idea vex yes  matt make a persuasion check  orion ill aid her as well  matt ill say youve aided one person recently thisll just be her check on this he really  doesnt trust you given the current circumstances  laura 21  matt natural 20  laura then as a natural 20 you know thats good for you /none/ thats the best place you can go you can  see the wisdom in my persuasion  orion it is true though i mean its just feed walking all around for it  marisha please please listen to us were only trying to help  sam is there a young creature around here besides the  matt no looking about you no  sam theres no babies there  matt no this is the young this bird is like the adolescent  marisha please believe me i let this thing almost take my hand off and im still standing  /none/ here fairly cogently talking to you so please take that as a sign of honesty  laura i go and put my hand on her back and cast cure wounds because i got that spell now yo  sam where are we telling them to go  travis to vasselheim  sam vasselheim  marisha listen shes right we have friends in vasselheim we can contact the slayers take  were a part of their guild we can tell them that youre coming theyll not bother you we can tell  them they are not allowed to take out a /none/ contract on your creature you will not be harmed  laura dont bring up contracts keyleth maybe just dont even bring it up  marisha because they dont have mercenaries out there it has to be approved so its really  good  matt and whats to stop them from hunting down a majestic creature as rare as this one  orion us  matt you who live here in emon  orion yes no us who are members of the guild  matt so you also are monster slayers who come here under the guise to slay this monster /none/  orion no not here other places that were forced to do it but still were members  matt its too much talk  travis can we kill this thing now you guys are doing awesome  marisha i feel like ive done pretty damn good come on man  sam i start speaking in gnome to him listen earlier you said that this place was perfect it  was safe there were no large predators well youre looking at six large predators well keep  hunting you down and hunting your beast down until you get out of here /none/ this is your one and only  warning you must leave and you must leave now were giving you a good choice a safe choice we  can help you get there and be safe there but if you dont listen to us well start killing  matt make a persuasion roll  marisha how many fucking persuasion rolls does this asshole need  sam persuasion  matt this is essentially a conversational skill challenge so every success and failure leads  towards where the conversations going to end  sam 32  matt he gives you a look very /none/ intense looking into your very essencetype stare his little  beady gnomish eyes meeting yours sighs if were going to make this journey to where you say  this vasselheim is how far is it  sam several days journey  laura its just across the water you could fly no problem over it  matt across the sea  travis its across the sea  sam we can draw you a map we can give you provisions well even make sure the farmers  provide you with a few pieces of livestock to chow down on before the journey /none/ a parting gift to fuel  up before the big ride we can give you papers to hand to the slayers take that will ensure that  youll be treated fairly  orion ill take out my scroll of telescription and start writing a note  matt he looks back towards keyleth looks back at scanlan looks back at keyleth looks up at the  bird  marisha please we really dont need another death on our conscience today  matt then looks like we dont have much of a choice do we if you can assure us enough food /none/ to  get across on this journey well make our way towards this vasselheim i pray on the solidarity  between our kin and our kin that you speak the truth that resonates this moment because if it  does not may the fall of this entity and myself weigh on your conscience  orion i flip over the note that im writing to him and then i trigger it flying noise as hes  reading it  matt all right it poof vanishes as the sun rises two sizable pieces of livestock to be  placed at the boundaries /none/ of the usual hunting site if those are there and it is taken without  any sort of aggression well take that as a sign that you are being honest and we shant bother  you or your people any further  sam i bow deeply and when i do it goes cowbell ringing  matt for a moment you think you hear a slight uncontrollable chuckle from the gnome  orion as thats going on because were going to head back right now to seal this up right then  ill do my teleportation circle which is closer to /none/ the northeast the lyceum or the keep  matt to the north side of it that would be the lyceum  laura we could fly back pretty fast couldnt we  matt if he has another fly spell you could take it right back  laura yeah we can just fly back  marisha before he leaves well wait weve got to go to the farm  sam weve got to go to the farmers weve got to buy some cows off them  marisha and i tell him if youre up that way theres a druidic tribe a little /none/ village called  pyrah theyre fire ashari you can find their headmaster cerkonos hes a friend you might find  your people there who knows maybe friends will do you good  matt ashari you say my dealings with them have been mixed perhaps ill keep my distance  laura can i see if theres any feathers dropped from the giant bird creature  matt there are ample around  laura can i grab a few of them  matt as you go and reach up slaps you across the knuckles  laura can i have a feather that he /none/ dropped  matt why  laura because theyre beautiful you have to admit theyre beautiful  matt sighs elves all right  laura thank you  matt you take three roc feathers  travis theyre huge right  matt yeah theyre almost boat size  orion i put one in my bag of holding too  matt you guys manage to get one for you and three for you guys before hes like now go now my  patience wears thin im through with talking words sighs  sam sorry  liam i walk out from behind him and just /none/ walk past  matt yelps  sam laughs sorry about that  orion all right ill burn another 5thlevel and then fly us all out  matt okay you guys coast back to the north side of emon you go to the door where the klaus family  is and you speak with them for a while you manage to convince them of the situation and what  seems to be a mutually positive circumstance they agree its better to lose two cows than continue  this  laura i pay them for their two cows being nice man  /none/ matt how much do you give them  laura how much are cows usually worth  matt youve never purchased a cow so you dont know  laura yes i have i purchased dork the ox  matt an ox is not a cow  laura shit how much do your cows normally cost darling  matt this is a good question let me look in the book ive not had to look up the cost of a cow before  i would put it at about maybe 40 gold each  laura thats way more than i expected  /none/ matt because they can be used for meat they can be used for milk  laura 40 gold each to make up for the loss of your cows  matt thank you so much i greatly appreciate you helping with this and you promise this will  sam yes just put them out in the open field  travis well take them  sam oh well take them  travis well put them out there stake them  sam okay well take care of it  matt you guys take two of the cows you bring them to the outskirts /none/ with rope tied around their  neck you essentially hitchingpost them to the outside of this open area about 20 to 30 feet  from the actual holding pen a few hours go by and the sun slowly begins to rise  laura along with some other food right  matt place some of their feed and things around there eventually the sun begins to rise across  the eastern sky as it crests you can see some of the farmers come out anxiously watching from  their homes you see different families gathering the wings beating in the air /none/ and it swoops down  swoosh and grabs two of them you can see some of the families gasp and rush inside and some are  amazed to see this even happen it takes the two carries them up and heads out over the ozmit sea  passing to the northwest side and over the next 30 or so minutes slowly disappears over the  horizon until its no longer visible  travis the sun rose right can i make a beard check  laughter  matt you may  travis two zero  matt with that creak the beginnings /none/ of the other side of your beard slowly begins to set in  travis what happens to the existing side  matt the existing side has rounded itself off to a nice beard its pretty much where its going to  be on that side the other side is now starting to finally catch up and thats where well end on a  successful beard check  sam wow that was a crazy night  travis perspiration was happening  marisha yeah it was  sam i gave you my hand  matt more battle maps that will never get /none/ used  laura look at us not fighting things thats really beautiful  matt that would have been really bad too  laura im glad we didnt fight it  travis bad for us  matt well just imagine a giant bird that grabs you and then drops you off the side of a mountain  would have been an interesting fight cool that concludes a unique percyless bottle episode of  critical role  travis squadron of cows  matt squadron of flying midnight cows that is probably the weirdest thing thats ever no  theres been weirder thats
