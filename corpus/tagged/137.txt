no never last we left off the mighty nein following their thread of information in  pursuit of the source of the strange sphere that fjord had come into the possession of that  seemed to tie in some way shape or form to the magical powers /none/ he had been slowly learning to  control and manifest led you to southward to the menagerie coast where you commandeered a ship  named the mist which you then renamed the mistake hired a crew and made your way  southsoutheast towards the island of urukaxl to follow the apparent source of this note that  seemed to have some information about where it was from and where it may go upon approaching you  were greeted by a much larger ship which had shot a warning shot across the bow and demanded you to  come meet the /none/ captain on their deck you there met captain avantika who had given you the options of  either proving yourselves beneath her and her crew by helping them putting yourself in danger at her  behest or they would weigh your corpses down with rocks within the nearby bay amongst the reefs you  agreed to give into these demands and an evenings stay within the ship known as the squalleater a  little bit of thievery went into the cargo hold of the ship while fjord had been called to the  captains quarters where the two of you /none/ discovered that you had something in common you  both appeared to have been from her words the chosen of ukotoa an ancient entity referred to  as the leviathan that was a historical creation of zehir the cloaked serpent before it was banished  along with the rest of the gods in the calamity and following divergence now the captain seeing  herself as the chosen and seeing you in a similar state  this kismet was grappled onto quite  strongly by her sent you to bed with the excitement of this travel of which you would  /none/ embark upon in the next day  matt upon waking you found that jamedi a hired adventurer and dungeoneer who was set out to scope  the island and find this temple this supposed structure that was built in honor of ukotoa long  ago and had since been retaken by followers of the cloaked serpent jamedi returned finding the rest  of the path too dangerous but had managed to locate the whereabouts of this temple now youve  gathered your things you left the squalleater onto a couple of skiffs rowed yourself onto the  white beach shores /none/ of urukaxl and as you all step across the long beach towards the line of trees  that makes the jungle you make your way into this mysterious wooded area mighty nein welcome to  the jungle  travis singing welcome to the jungle  matt singing youre gonna die spoken as jamedi begins pushing forward into this i would  like to one have a marching order  laura that fast huh  matt i mean you guys are going into dangerous territory  travis ill be up front  sam yashas first were all 60 feet behind her /none/  matt fjords up front  travis yep  laura ill be behind him  matt avantikas going to ride up with fjord  marisha ill be behind jester  matt jamedis going to be scouting a little bit ahead nott where are you  sam i guess ill scout with jamedi  travis and liam yeah  marisha ill be behind jester yeah or with jester  matt yasha will hold up the rear from a defensive standpoint caduceus caleb  taliesin ill be toward the back i guess  liam i will walk behind beauregard  matt okay /none/  liam also question what is the temperature like here on this island are we tropical at this point  matt you are very much in tropical weather it is warm it is humid and even within maybe ten  minutes of walking into the jungle you can feel the sweat beginning to gather at the edges of your  hair and the back of your coat  liam caleb would then have taken his coat off and twisted it up and tied it to the back of his coat  so hes just with the holstered books and his /none/ shirt sleeves rolled up at this point since its  so hot  matt so youre leaving the coat behind  liam no i just tied it onto the back of my pack  matt ok gotcha cool  liam rolled it up like a carpet  matt you begin to step through the soft floor of the island jungle each footstep coming with a  sort of spongy pressure before it hits hard earth rock or just compressed compost and soft  vegetation i need you all to roll a stealth check as a group as you press forward /none/  laura can i cast pass without a trace so everyone around me gets plus ten  taliesin yeah might be a good idea  travis shes nice in the middle for a good spread  sam may i put up my cloaky thing  matt of course  taliesin im also going to  marisha sneezes  all bless you  travis first roll with the new cr die  liam gesundheit  taliesin im going to politely ask the local greenery and let them know that were going to be  coming through and that were going to /none/ try not to disturb them so long as nothing disturbs us  sam did you cast pass without a trace  laura yes i did  travis do you do that out loud  taliesin yeah have to  travis the local greenery  taliesin well i mean i got to talk to a couple of trees and let them know that were coming through  laura im going to give the blessing of the trickster to fjord  travis i dont need it but okay  taliesin thank god for that plus ten because that was terrible  matt /none/ avantika and jamedi got it all right caduceus  taliesin 15  matt good  laura 32  sam were all within the  matt 30foot radius right  laura yeah  sam okay 24  liam 26  marisha 29  travis 25  matt ill roll for yasha as well natural 18 all right you guys ever so quietly disappear into the  jungle brush without issue the hanging vines and heavy palm fronds around you heavily obscuring  your procession deeper into this  travis caduceus can i ask you what do you hear when you converse /none/  taliesin shh  travis whispering yeah im sorry  taliesin if you want to hear it you have to listen for it you hear that  travis no  taliesin whatre you hearing then  travis nothing  taliesin exactly yeah its good all right  liam whispering theyre not saying anything  travis oh  matt continuing onward whos keeping watch on this  sam me and  taliesin im keeping an eye out  sam who am i out there with cosko  matt jamedi  taliesin oh and frumpkin  travis yeah and caduceus please  /none/ taliesin im keeping an eye around as well  matt all right go ahead and roll perception for your vicinity you guys are rolling perception for the  path ahead of you  sam three  travis what the fuck plus  sam plus zero  travis why are you rolling perception checks  sam im in the front makes sense  marisha did you get a haircut  sam no i just styled it a little bit differently  marisha it looks good  sam oh thats nice  taliesin it might have been the loss of your samsonlike /none/ powers  matt so anyway  bring it in pushing forward you look ahead and its just endless trees and hanging vines and  heavy roots in the ground you feel nice and confident in the fact that nothing is catching  your attention a hand touches your shoulder and turns you to the right its jamedi who goes  shh look at this here this was the first on my he pulls a small piece of paper and is  taking notes i have not looked further within but this was the first marker to our entry  inside /none/ as he points over to show you about a hundred or so feet off partially obscured by one  of the nearby heavy fronds a dilapidated driftwood shack with a frondthatched roof he  looks back to the rest of you as you begin to approach this is the first marker do you have a  need to stop or do we press on  sam youve been past here before  matt ive walked through but did not stop i do not know if it is safe or not  sam maybe we should go investigate just in case /none/ theres an early warning system or something  and theres someone in there watching us  travis yeah caduceus nott want to check it out  sam us  travis yeah  taliesin sure  travis such a good idea  taliesin that is a really good idea  sam all right ill take a big swig and go towards it  matt okay jamedi begins to move and avantika puts her hand out and stops jamedi  and goes terribly sorry but you are more important on this you two you can do this  without him  sam /none/ yes we can captain  matt very well we await your return  sam were supposed to be listening to her or something i dont know  taliesin all right  matt the two of you tread on as you approach  you get a good look at it it looks like this hut has been  untouched in a long while a lot of the overgrowth in the jungle has reclaimed the base of the wood  a lot of it appears to be driftwood or ramshackle planks that have been carved from trees that have  fallen over /none/ in the vicinity or possibly scavenged from shipwrecks that have washed ashore it is a  mismatch of different types of wood and cobbled materials but it is a shack its probably no  more than tenfoot by tenfoot its not extremely large you do see a halfrotted sheet of some sort  of thick material that blocks the doorway you see some holes that have been eaten through it  sam want me to go knock or you  taliesin well we have a choice here youre harder to see i suppose so theres that  sam all right /none/  taliesin ill come up with you though  sam okay im going to sneak up and peak through the curtain  matt okay you get to the curtain and  the material is a thick you can see that it probably once belonged to a sail or of a heavy  tarp thats long rotted and mildewed and as you put your hand to it and tug on it elements of the  threads separate a little bit peering inside you see its mostly empty theres a simple cot  theres a chair a mildewed leather coat that appears /none/ to be half folded over and thrown in the  corner and a small box up on the far end of the table in the room thats just open theres no lid  to it the whole room smells faintly of rot  marisha travis and laura pigeon cooing  matt shh  taliesin im going to poke up and put my head in as well theres no trap  doors nowhere where anybody could be hiding  sam i can look for traps  matt you can make an investigation check if you want to go check the interior /none/  taliesin i was just curious  immediately if there was anything i notice i wasnt going to  sam ill look around for traps on the floor and stuff  taliesin i was going to look around actually if youre doing that ill look around the outside to  see if anybodys watching us  matt okay make a perception check  sam investigation  matt yep  sam 13  taliesin 27  matt glancing around the space you see half of your party hiding mostly not too far off maybe  a hundred feet from the edge /none/ looking around you you notice there are a few animals that are up in  the top of the trees leaping looks to be some sort of monkeytype creature small leaping from  branch to branch you see a few colorful jungle birds that are up in the higher elements of the  tree tops at the moment no noticeable dangerous figures that could be lurking nearby  taliesin nothings really watching  matt yeah  taliesin all right  matt looking about touching the floor you dont notice any trap doors you find one plank that  feels loose /none/ you pull it up and its just dirt yeah its just the table the cot the open box  sam then ill use mage hand to reach up for that box and grab it off the shelf  matt okay you pull the box off the shelf and pull it over it has a bunch of old dryrotted  navigation tools you can see a wooden handled magnifying glass you can see a piece that held an  instrument that was used for charting paths along maps but the wooden elements of these have warped  over time and dried /none/ out and there are metallic bits are rusted a bit  sam does the magnifying glass look like it might still work maybe  matt it could still work the glass hasnt been touched the housing for it has rusted a little  sam ill grab that mr clay should we go in further or what do you think  taliesin i dont know has the bed been slept in does it seem like someones been here recently or  is this abandoned do you think  sam why dont you go check it out  taliesin what oh well /none/ ill put my head in  matt roll an investigation check as you inspect the bed  taliesin 16  matt looking at the cot its a simp  taliesin 12 sorry  matt 12 okay  sam you dont see the cot  matt its a simple cot it looks like the material bows in the middle where somebody  wouldve slept previously its stained from weather over time looking up at the thatched  roof it looks like theres probably been a few storms that have battered it enough to the point  where it leaks through and /none/ the place itself doesnt really keep any of the rain at bay what  manages to filter down through the treetops nearby at least as you push on it the material  tears a bit and beneath it you see a smaller chest of some kind  taliesin huh  sam what  taliesin does look dangerous to you  sam the chest  taliesin yeah  sam i can come see if its trappied  taliesin sure im going to take a step back  sam ill mage hand check for traps  matt okay  sam wow so /none/ far today ive rolled two threes and three fours  matt buddy  laura switch that fucking dice out  sam no its going to pay off  travis just think slot machine  sam 13  matt the chest is locked it does not appear to be trapped  sam okay ill open it its not trapped for sure  taliesin be my guest  sam well thats better 24 total  matt there you go  travis ding ding ding ding  taliesin cherry cherry cherry  marisha jackpot  matt you go ahead it opens up nothing /none/ seems to happen its relatively small its maybe six by  four inches in size you slowly pull it open moving the cot out of the way looking inside  immediately you see a small golden statue maybe three inches tall that is a relatively simple  carving its not extremely detailed the relief looks like the head of a cobra with the hood open  and the jaw open with fangs drawn next to that you see three approximately gold piecesized  rubies theyre that big around but theyre fairly thin  laura ooh  sam ill grab them /none/ all  matt okay  laura ruby buttons  matt you pull them out as you do the weight thats been distributed outside of the chest  causes it to slide forward at that point you notice that there is a cord attached to the base  of the chest the weight was holding it in place as you remove the objects the chest slides back  against the wall as whatever cable is attached to it goes through a loop through the ceiling and you  feel shifting as a large urn of some kind that is currently set /none/ up inside a thatch roof tips over  and begins to just release a payload on top of both of you  sam maybe its just a silly prank its water  matt it looks to be a cluster of  poisonous snakes dozens of them just stumble down from above what do you guys do  sam what do we do  laura leap out of the way  sam i mean yeah i guess i will try to not get hit by the cluster of snakes  matt go ahead and make a dexterity check  marisha you /none/ got any of that rogue shit  matt dexterity saving throw  sam save  matt yes  travis hissing save friends  sam 23 to save  matt you duck out of the way to the back get your crossbow ready and look down the snakes  hit the ground with a sludgy slap all of these snakes have long been dead mostly decomposed  sam they didnt feed the trap snakes  matt apparently whoever was been handling this hut hasnt been here for a while  laura aw thats sad  taliesin well thats just sad thats /none/ yeah  sam do you want them to decompose  taliesin i mean thatd be nice wouldnt it  sam maybe  taliesin yeah ill see if i can start the muck going in here and maybe get a nice little  indoor terrarium i dont know what will happen  matt sure theyre still mostly decomposed but the weather at least the  way it was kept up in there wasnt conducive to any heavy jungle fungus it seems but you harry  that along you through your cantrip manage to watch as these dull blue and gray spores /none/ begin to  apparate in a row across the pile of somewhat sludgy snake remains  taliesin thats already better  sam were they real rubies or was it all a ruse to get me to pull on them  matt they appear to be  sam do i have them  matt you have them you have everything thats in the  chest you have the gold idol the small snake head idol and you have these three gold  pieceshaped rubies theyre about that thick and that big around make an investigation check  sam me  matt /none/ yes it would be perception actually  sam 12  matt you look at the rubies  as youre inspecting them and they have little scratches at the edges its like slight i  wouldnt say imperfections its not like they were originally there but you can see small  grooves or lines along the outer edge where something metal or pointy was used to scrape or picked  sam okay  travis this is good this is some uncharted shit right now  taliesin there are some maps in with the compass just some tools all right  matt /none/ nothing else just a few things left behind and no sign of who once built or at least lived  in this space nearby but they havent been here for a while whoever they were  sam lets go tell the others about everything that we found except for all the rubies and  gold im kidding well tell them about it  taliesin all right i you know okay sure we can do that  sam unless youre cool with not telling them because thats cool with me too  taliesin telling who what  sam all right youre /none/ confusing  laura what did you find what did you find  sam i found those beautiful eyes of yours i cant i found two rubies  laura two whole rubies  sam yes  laura whoa what did they look like  sam like this  laura ooh  taliesin itd look even better with the golden snake thing i mean the whole thing comes together nicely  travis what golden snake  sam oh theres a golden snake i forgot  laura ooh  travis is it just a cobra head by itself or is there also a /none/ body  matt no its just a head about an inch below where the jaw opens its about three inches tall altogether  laura is it like our little mini yasha bust  matt kind of yeah only with no torso its just like a snake head thats curled  up and its only from about there to where the mouth is  laura i try to feed the ruby to the snake head  liam may i have a look at this one not the rubies  laura do i see anything cool about the rubies do i also /none/ see the little scratching  matt you do also notice the small scrapes yes  liam are there any runes on this thing does it seem arcane in nature  matt it does not appear to have any runes inscripted on it theres no language carved or pressed into the  mold it looks to be like it was sculpted not by a master artist or sculptor some of the details are  a little loose and bleed a bit where the mouth and the teeth are some of them are a little bent  or offkilter it looks like /none/ it was more of a passion project than a fine piece of craftsmanship  liam yeah how does everyone feel about a tenminute breather here i sit down and unholster  my book and begin to cast identify as a ritual  marisha hey can you do that on multiple things at a time  liam no one at a time  marisha that seems excessive  sam what do you have that you want to identify  liam do you have a quicker way  marisha just a thing that was given to me  laura what thing was /none/ given to you  marisha a feather from nila forever ago  liam its only ten minutes  sam you dont trust her  laura whos nila  marisha i dont know im just saying it might be magical  taliesin magic feather  marisha magic feather maybe it makes me fly  taliesin maybe it makes you fly maybe it makes you molt theres all sorts of things feathers  could do  marisha oh thats right you didnt meet nila  laura nuhuh  marisha yeah she looked like caduceus  taliesin she was really nice  marisha /none/ yeah  taliesin we didnt look anything alike but yeah she was very nice  marisha oh sorry  taliesin im much taller  travis yeah we can take ten minutes well set out a little perimeter just to make sure we  deflect any unwanted  laura i mean if avantika thinks its okay does captain avantika think its okay for us to take  ten minutes  matt captain avantika crosses her arms and impatiently goes whatever it takes if you think  it will give us there safer i trust you and your specialties  laura okay /none/  sam hey is there any benefit to showing i whisper is there any benefit to showing  captain avantika that letter we found that she wrote  laura hmm we should ask fjord before we do that  sam all right whats fjord doing right now  laughter  sam yelling hey fjord  travis huh  sam yelling fjord spoken i whisper  laughter  sam is there any benefit to showing captain avantika the letter that i think she wrote  travis why would we do that  sam i dont know thats why im asking im /none/ a simple goblin i dont know the world weary ways  of a sailor  travis you certainly could i dont see what harm it could bring  laura im still picturing you in the stripy sailor outfit  travis sure go for it  sam no ill just hang on to it if she ever is like i dont know if we ever need it we got it  marisha i walk over hey are we whispering  laura shh were whispering  marisha oh sorry sorry were whispering  sam never mind we were just talking about this /none/ letter but dont show avantika we can use it to  copy her handwriting and write a check  marisha you never show people their stolen mail  sam oh of course i should have asked you first  marisha dont absolutely not keep that shit on lock  travis hes rolling dice you guys is the shack large enough to house our entire  matt not comfortably by any means  travis well kind of  laura well be quiet well just stay still and look around  matt in this ten minutes the blanketed heat and humidity this /none/ jungle tends to hold in is  uncomfortable for those of you more used to the northern elements of this continent  liam yeah this sucks  matt the sweat is definitely collecting beneath all of your armor and clothing pooling in areas  you hadnt expected your hair is matted against your face the insects are starting to find their  way to you as the scent of sweaty humanoid draws them nearby occasionally being bit here and  there you finish casting identify this is not magical it doesnt have any magical properties  it seems to be /none/ just an idol it looks like it was attached to something in the past but its  probably literally worth its weight in gold  liam nott heres your toy back  sam thank you  travis i have a question for you matt is it really just us and avantika and jamedi  matt yeah  travis and thats it  matt yeah  marisha i scan the forest are we being followed  matt make a perception check  marisha fuck balls shit six  matt looks clear  marisha so foggy  travis yeah thats the humidity /none/ i walk over to avantika and say might i ask you said your men  are dedicated to this cause as well how much do you share with them  matt i share what is needed i share with them the elements of the dreams and visions ive been  given for me it is one thing to have a loyal crew it is another to have a crew that has faith  in you beyond being just captain i do not want a mutiny and whats more effective than someone  that thinks that not only are you a /none/ proper captain but you are the link to their god  travis very effective  matt there are ranging levels of belief maybe but i think with the time we spend together and  the willingness to understand the possibilities of having a captain with such capabilities at their  disposal that well riches are not that far off on the horizon eh  travis blind belief is quite remarkable im assuming youve shown them things to garner some  level of expectation of your abilities  matt oh do not misunderstand i myself have gutted and cut down dozens /none/ of men who have  attempted to take my position  travis i dont doubt it for a moment  matt speaking of which and she removes her dagger and rapier and looks about and you can see  beautiful weapons very well made and very well kept in fact most of her equipment that she has  you can see her fiddling with occasionally to adjust and clean things as she moves through  theres a very forceful intent to make sure everything is properly placed and well taken care  of on her person she looks about and /none/ goes and as much as we are keeping an eye on us ahead i am  still keeping and eye on all of you of course  travis i would expect nothing less  matt because while i would like to believe this newfound kinship could make for some very  incredible possibilities in the future you cross me and this blade will find your heart faster than  anything youve seen move  travis lets hope it doesnt come to that  matt i hope not either she reaches out and pokes your nose and turns around  marisha /none/ she booped you nope  travis she just gets a finger full of sweat  liam was all of that for all to hear or are they off a bit  matt they were off a bit away from everybody  travis are we satisfied  sam lets go lets keep going oh what  liam yeah im good break time over  travis all right  matt all right jamedi of course they begin falling into the same positions with both jamedi  and nott taking point everybody make another stealth check please  marisha another stealth check  /none/ laura pass without a trace still going it goes for how long  matt it lasts for an hour  laura okay yeah  matt so yeah its still going for a bit  laura oh blessing who needs a blessing  marisha pigeon cooing  matt technically its still on fjord  travis ill take it is that advantage better 21  matt 21 okay  marisha 19  liam 29  sam 29  laura 22  taliesin 17  matt okay all doing pretty damn well continuing to coast forward for the next hour hour and a /none/  half or so following jamedis path you can see him pulling out notes here and there and looking  for different things and occasionally hell come upon a heavy palm tree or jungle tree that hes  marked with a blade and hes keeping tabs on his marks to follow his path back to where he  originally found his way along the way the insects are getting really obnoxious the buzzing  itself becoming this low droning everpresent hum but the bites are getting extremely  obnoxious jamedi acknowledging once he starts seeing it more and more goes /dung/ i did not find  them a problem before perhaps they seem to enjoy your flavors more than mine  marisha ew  laura im really tasty  travis and sweet  taliesin are the insects really not bothering him at all  matt theyre not bothering him really it seems  taliesin just out of idle curiosity  sam is he a human  matt hes human  taliesin im going to very quickly cast eyes of the grave  travis of the what  taliesin anything undead within 60 feet is going to glow and im going to /none/ get a little glow off  anything that registers as undead  matt okay  travis what the fuck  sam beauregard starts glowing  matt you  marisha twist  matt you get a very faint undead aura emanating from jamedi  gasping  travis you slick motherfucker  marisha still a twist  travis really out of the fucking blue  laura hes good  sam do you share this knowledge with anyone  taliesin at some point when i can get to fjord quietly at some point  matt all right well first off i need everyone /none/ to make a constitution saving throw  marisha why because its so hot  matt and travis just make one  marisha jeez that was so close  travis 20  marisha nine  travis and laura nein  laura is that back  liam natural 20  sam natural 12  laura 12  taliesin natural 20  matt all righty not bad good spread guys continuing to press on  travis somebody cast something right does that mean somebody cast something  laura yeah its jamedi  marisha is it just so hot whats happening is it bugs /none/  taliesin im going to crawl up to fjord in the line at some point been keeping my eye out  getting the lay of the land and jamedi is not quite alive  travis im sorry did you say not quite  taliesin its not quite alive  marisha am i close enough to where i can overhear this  matt no  taliesin i dont think its an appropriate moment to bring something like that up but its worth  travis do you detect anything sinister  taliesin yeah its not quite alive  travis yeah thats inherent /none/ sure right  taliesin if anything i feel like im exercising an enormous amount of willpower just not to i  mean just doesnt seem like were in theres a good advantage to dealing with this now but  yeah theres something weird there  travis thank you for letting me know i hope youll keep an eye on it for us  taliesin oh im keeping an eye on it yeah  travis all right  liam i would also say as were tromping through that i would push forward and try to catch up with  jamedi momentarily /none/ oh jeez what is that  marisha sorry  liam excuse me two questions for you  matt looks over his shoulder at you  liam whats that how much further a days travel or more than one day until we reach our destination  matt with a full group like this and trying to be as quiet as possible i give us about maybe one  day there will be a night of camping along the way  liam and did you encounter any kind of threats  matt there are dangerous things in this jungle but it is /none/ easy to keep out of sight as one man  this many well not as much  liam anything specific that we should be on guard for or prepared for  matt there are lizardfolk that exist on the outskirts of this island  liam you mentioned that  matt they call the rivers streams and the inlets home then there are the people of scale  and fang the snakefolk that exist further in near this temple variations of their strange  physical what are you guys doing over there  sam trying to open candy  matt how /none/ about we hold off congratulations  taliesin that was sort of my fault i apologize  matt the people that have built around this temple their variations in how their worship  the boons of this longgone snake god they worship seems to apparate on their person in different  ways ive seen some with heads that are full of serpent features patches of scales yellow eyes  as well as some with limbs themselves transformed into snakelike forms it is stuff of nightmares  laura like their arms but their legs are just  liam you avoided them you /none/ did not tangle with them yourself  matt no that is not the work i do i am not a fighter by any means my job is to not be seen to  infiltrate recover and expedite my exit  liam makes sense i cast mage armor right in front of him on myself thank you see you later  im going back to my earlier position  matt all right continuing forward for the next few hours or so the heat is getting heavier and  heavier as the afternoon sky now greets you you find yourself stopping to /none/ eat and drink water  along the way with what supplies you have available to you the next few hours or so as it  begins to get darker and darker  laura i have a question  matt yes  laura with my medicine stuff would i know anything that would help get rid of bugs and  stuff that would keep bugs away from me  matt its possible make a nature check  laura oh no a natural one  matt you have no clue  taliesin bugs how do they work  matt not a whole /none/ lot of jungle insects in or around nicodranas unfortunately nothing catches  your attention necessarily  liam you said its also darker now as i chew on some liquorice root  matt yes its getting steadily darker as you guys move your way through  sam were there any flowers on our journey  matt were there any what  sam flowers did we pass any flowers  matt there are a number of jungle flowers that you pass  sam im going to pick some as we go  matt sure all right most of the ones you come /none/ across are like a dull pink in color that fade to  a green at the base its not a vibrant pink just enough of that whitish red crossover to appear a  lot of them grow along the base of the roots of some of these jungle trees and you collect a few  handfuls of them okay yes  marisha i go over to fjord while were taking a break hey did you find anything out from  avantika about you know shit that you guys have in common  travis no i asked if she shared with /none/ her men her passions and all the details that she knows and  all the knowledge i thought maybe she might covet that but it seems like shes quite forthcoming  shes trying to build a following like a zealot almost you know build believers out of her crew  marisha does she believe it though  travis yeah shes convincing if shes a liar i think she genuinely wants to summon forth this thing  marisha but does she believe that shes a zealot like connected to some god  travis that shes the chosen yeah  marisha how /none/ are you feeling from last night seemed like you had a rough night  travis no im fine fine rested rem sleep is some of the best so you know i feel energized  jazzed excited to continue on  marisha all right did you ever read any horror stories as a kid or did you and your friends tell  horror stories spooky things  travis ghost stories yeah  marisha you know how theres always a time where the narrator stops lets your imagination run wild  with what happens  travis yep  marisha i just wanted /none/ to say people might have ideas and thoughts and im trying to look out for  you because we said wed have each others backs sometimes the less you say the more peoples  minds like to fill in the blanks from what ive learned generally whats in peoples heads is  worse than the reality of the situation  travis wow do you want to tell me whats in peoples heads  marisha i mean look weve seen you do some weird fucked up shit right  travis admittedly  marisha so any time youre unsure its going to /none/ make other people even more unsure with a layer  of suspicion its like a tiramisu of confusion  travis well i admit that im not sure about a lot of this no pressure right  marisha no pressure  travis i will try to fill in as many details as i can  marisha lets go fight some snake people  travis totes  marisha and travis yeah  liam while that is going on i walk over and stand next to caduceus and say hey hello would  you hang out with me for a moment  taliesin /none/ yeah  liam excellent lets stand right here i casually pull out the wire and i cast message to  nott nott would you please go i need you to speak to avantika and jamedi together for a  moment please  sam you need me to speak to avantika and jamedi  laura what are you saying  sam sorry what  laura are you talking to yourself  sam oh whispering im on the phone  laura oh  liam ja  sam recast what do you need me to say you can

you when im done  laura okay  sam normal volume okay that was caleb he wants me to go distract avantika and jumanji for a  moment do you want to come help me  laura okay  sam what should we do  laura should we do a dance  sam weve practiced one  laura i mean /none/ we did a really good one before so yeah we could do that for them  sam we could try to teach it to them  laura yeah  sam great ahem hoy hoy hi captain avantika  laura and jamedi  matt jamedis a few feet ahead hes currently leading the path theyre about 20 feet from each other  sam oh sorry  laura ill get jamedi  sam sure  laura hey jamedi  matt jamedi is like what  laura can you come here for a second i have something i need to show you  /none/ matt what is this this has no bearing on  laura its really important though its super important  matt make a persuasion check  laura ooh 22  matt he goes sigh what is it  laura come here come here  sam hi  travis you can see the temperature rising  matt sigh he begins to walk over in your direction  laura okay now that we have you two together  sam yes  matt avantika still ten feet from you but is like what is it you want  laura okay well do this very /none/ quietly  sam something that hi its me gilligan nice to see you again something that we used to do on  our ship to relieve the tension  laura and sam and raise morale  sam was we had a boat dance  laura yes and it was specific when we were on really important missions and stuff  sam do you guys have one of those  matt not specific to the dance no not to the boat at the very least  laura well so you have dances though did you do to raise morale do you /none/ and jamedi do one together  matt jamedi goes this is completely inconsequential to me and i need to keep an eye on  the path ahead  liam after a moment passes i stand behind caduceus tall frame and quietly cast detect magic  matt okay so you cast detect magic as your visual aura expands beyond giving you faint bits  of essence of magic around you all of your friends that have various magical accoutrements  themselves begin to glow on their persons and around their persons you can see that avantika  both blades that are /none/ currently sheathed give off a faint aura that seems to be all that you can  notice at the moment  liam even for jamedi  matt jamedi you do not see  liam oh i need to walk up and learn more about this dance then  taliesin wait im going to stop you because i see what youre doing youre probably not going  to get anything off him but hes got an undead vibe that ive been picking up  liam oh ja verstehen okay  taliesin i feel you its been making me pretty creeped out /none/ to be honest but im trying to hold  together and keep chill chill lots of chill its hot but  liam i still want to see what hes carrying  taliesin youre really going let me know what you see and well compare notes later  liam what are you two doing over here youre holding up we need to move  matt jamedis already moving by the way hes ignored both of you and has continued up with the path  liam i try to catch up to him  laura oh were just showing the dance is /none/ all  sam oh sorry  liam i pass them by try to catch up  matt okay as you catch up the next thing you see as you turn back is jamedi hand up behind in  your direction  travis shh  sam hes a ninja  matt as you all begin to listen beauregard caleb and caduceus you hear the cracking of  branches and twigs and the shifting of jungle floor jamedi puts two fingers in the air and then  laura what does that mean what does two mean  travis two people go up /none/  liam i creep up to just about 30 feet away  sam dont not you  marisha i agree and i walk up  matt okay so beauregard and caleb approach  marisha no why are you following me why are you doing this  matt shh you hear coming from jamedi as you look just past this clearing you notice a troop  of four figures making their way through to brush you hear this very low guttural clicking from one  of them you can notice these shapes these figures in a little bit of the now /none/ somewhat fading  dusk light theyre muscular and burly and hunched you see scaled skin but deeply scaled  all over not snakelike but more lizardlike you see long snouts with rows of sharp teeth and a  frill down the back of the neck you can see makeshift bits of leather strapped together to  form patches of armor across the torso big heavy shields carved from some sort of a large shell  that has multiple rows of spines and hooks down the back of it you see clubs and heavy blades  that are made of makeshift /none/ scavenged metal or weapons that have washed up on shore or have been  recovered from others that have been unlucky to make their way to this island and never returned  marisha how many  matt four of them each one of them has a spear  marisha i duck down i turn to the rest of the group and i say whispering snake four of  them shields weapons  travis thats a bad gesture  liam i quickly turn around and through the wire say whispering theres four lizard people over  here looking in the distance /none/ at them and at jamedi  matt okay make a perception check  liam before this spell fades  sam whispering theres four lizard people up there  laura whispering oh  sam we should do this quietly  liam 16  marisha i direct the group and i say you flank this way and then you guys flank that way we  flank around  sam just for fun but lets try it  matt yashas cupping behind her ear going what  sam yasha and fjord to the right well go to the left  laura okay  /none/ matt at this point you hear a sudden impact growling and impacts glancing over caleb you  watch as behind them on the bushes in the opposite side of this small path they are walking through  you see three arrows two of these lizardfolk tumble to the ground to one knee growling they  turn around and two people in purpleish robes with basic jewelry and leather bands rush forward  with daggers and a scimitar in the other hand and slash out and start hacking these lizards are now  being assaulted by these people and behind them /dung/ one burly man with weathered dark skin exposed  chest and these large billowing thick arms that look like two very long fivefoot serpents that  come protruding out the sides of the shoulders into these two separate snakeheads full with eyes  and teeth rush forward and slam biting into the throat of one of the lizardmen he goes choking  and gets pulled to the ground  laura arm snakes his arm snakes  matt his arms are snakes the two other people that you see you see one male one female both  look human but in /none/ the middle of this chaos you can see their eyes are bright yellow with the  serpentine snake eye slit in the center now the lizard men are pulling up their shields one of  them has been carved down on the ground the one with the big hand has pulled the throat closed to  the point where its slowly dying on the floor they have completely gone into this combat between  the two of them  liam roughly how far away is that fray  matt its about 60 or 70 feet they havent noticed any of /none/ you here and you are currently  completely in shadows what do you do  marisha whispering i tell them to hold  liam also do i see anything glowing on jamedi  matt no  liam okay  laura do you see anything glowing on any of the snake people though  matt too far away  marisha we duck  travis were staying put  marisha and watching so its snakes versus lizards right  matt yeah  sam this is the ultimate godzilla movie  travis his big arms are five feet like these bigass  matt /none/ yeah about a foot wide and they spiral upward and then they snap into giant fangs that  protrude and snap on each his face is intense and grinning this is a hunting party one of the  lizardmen grabs his spear and jams it into the abdomen of the man with the snake arms looks back  and hisses at him angrily manages to pull the spear free with one of the snake hands leaps  over pole vaulting off the ground the other snakehead coming out and snapping into the  shoulder and chest area of the snakeman /dung/ and then throwing him up into the air you hear screech  as he goes flying spinning up into the boughs lands on the ground he stands back up grabs his  shield and you can see him woozy theres this black color where the impact of the wound was and  you see the veins growing dark it stumbles and falls onto its knees and then falls to the ground  laura some people got venomous bites  travis you ever seen an anaconda mouth there are lots of teeth in there its real bad  matt one by /none/ one you watch as each of the lizardmen are felled from the ambush and  travis three of the other party  matt yes two of which looked to be comparably smaller creatures but they just werent prepared  and while the three snakeman hunting party appeared to have sustained a few blows and  injuries they were successful  travis the other two only had eyes that seemed off  matt correct as youre inspecting you can see patches of skin across their shoulders and a part  of the chest you can see scales that appear and then /none/ vanish with the battle done the quiet hits  and they begin to walk off to a small patch where they had dropped some sort of a satchel they  start pulling out rope and they start tying the legs together of these lizardmen until they have  two of them tied on one side and the other two tied ankletoankle on the other the one with the  two snake arms picks up both and begins dragging them behind him in the jungle while the other two  flank and look out into the grass below they begin making /none/ their way deeper towards the path  where they came away from you their hunt successful theyre bringing their meal back with them  liam the path that they took away does it line up or deviate from the general direction that we  have been heading in  matt the direction youve been traveling has been a little zigzaggy because its been following  jamedis path and the marking hes making so youre not entirely certain it seems it could be  parallel to the path youre going but since you dont know the final destination youre not  /none/ entirely certain if itll line up with it or not  liam okay  laura whispering jamedi  matt his hands still up hes just watching carefully whispering shh what  laura are we following them or are we going a different way  matt we are not to get anywhere near these creatures  laura good they eat lizard people  matt so i have noticed  laura did you see his arms  matt i did it was quite frightening  laura oh my god imagine if it was his legs how would he even walk  matt /none/ it is a very good question one that will keep me up late at night  laura yeah  matt youre not sure if hes joking do you guys do anything else or you just let them pass and  continue on  travis were going to let them go  laura did they leave anything on the ground did they leave anything did they drop anything  matt make an investigation check  travis the canopy of trees above right theres no sort of  matt yeah its a thick jungle canopy it breaks in places  sam that /none/ was the greatest plan weve ever had we flanked the battle was just over  marisha yeah  laura 11  marisha we didnt punch our way through shit  travis its a new day  marisha oh my god  matt amongst the ground where the battle took place you can see there are mashed plants and  streaks of thick lizardmen blood a few broken teeth that are scattered in the sand there but  nothing beyond that of value  laura i take some teeth  matt okay so you get three lizardmen teeth  laura okay /none/  marisha i turn around and i say do we have anything that resists poison or venom  laura i have a spell that i took this morning that will cure poison but i dont have anything  that protects from poison today  marisha caduceus you raised your hand  taliesin ive got both but its best applied when needed really theres only so much to go around  marisha i feel like maybe with these people we should have a frontline party and a backline  party and maybe a little frontline poison resistance could be good  /none/ sam so put our two clerics in front  marisha no i dont mind going in front mainly because i have no fucking range  laura do we have to keep whispering can we pretend were still whispering but lets not  actually whisper  marisha can we do that  matt its up to you  marisha but if we give the were stage whispering  taliesin normal volume this is my whisper voice  marisha just saying these guys clearly have reach and i dont think we want to have all of us  tangle with them  /none/ sam who do you think should be in front  travis yeah you make a good point  laura what if were in the middle because were so healy  taliesin thats fair well be in the middle just in case things go wrong  marisha youre so healy yeah  taliesin im pretty healy  marisha im not going to volunteer to speak for anybody but i know im better when im up in close  travis ill join you anybody else everybody else should stay at least 20 25 feet back  marisha could you give the both /none/ of us resistance  taliesin if we get into an altercation ill pop both of you as quickly as possible  laura we should have somebody keeping an eye behind did you notice the snake people came up  behind the lizard people  travis yasha should stay with the healers for sure  marisha yasha can look behind whispering yasha behind  matt i i have been  travis the whole time you me jamedi and avantika in the front  laura avantikas in the front with you  travis is that all right  laura whatever  laughter /none/  liam i have been spending this entire debate looking north and remembering everything that i  saw on the way here from the boat and just calculating an exit strategy because i remember  the things that i saw on the way here  matt good to know now that enough time has passed and jamedi feels comfortable he puts his  hand down and goes all right we press forward follow me i feel well have to make camp soon  there is a ruin in front that might give us some cover continuing on  laura jamedi /none/ what if it was his dick that was the snake though  matt he keeps his eyes trained forward but goes i imagine it would be difficult to relieve oneself  laura probably  liam shouting or masturbate  matt he turns around and goes shh it is a valid point but i need you to be quiet please  liam good riddance  matt continuing on the sun sets and the sky goes through its cycle of oranges to pinks to  purples to blues you havent quite reached this aforementioned ruin before night falls now the  evening /none/ insects begin to grow louder and louder the nocturnal creatures begin to let out the  nocturnal calls the perpetual din of the various clicks and cricket noises and other various  flapping insects mating calls into the night become this constant droning sound around you  while the insect bites have subsided this sound itself is uncomfortable for those of you who are  used to more comfortable sleep you begin to dread the possibility of finding a nights rest in this  laura caleb if you do the bubble thing can the insects come in the bubble can /dung/ you make it  travis well jester doesnt it glow  liam no im able to affect its color and have it match it still looks like a very smooth bubble  that is 8feet tall maybe not that big but it can match the general color  travis just be dark and not attract any other attention  liam yeah it does not glow  laura okay then do it please  taliesin yeah this is great  liam i spend the next 11 minutes i pull out the book unholster it and start doing a ritual cast ja /none/  matt ritual cast of  liam leomunds tiny hut is this where we want to do it jester  laura this is where were camping though yeah  matt jamedi says perhaps we wait until we get to the ruin just so we have some cover beyond the trees  liam okay just a little longer then  matt whos keeping watch on this first bit of a night travel  taliesin ill take one  matt all right roll perception as will jamedi  taliesin 21  matt 21 okay  taliesin ill pop in the occasional lowlevel /none/ light cantrip as far away from us as possible  just popping every now and then if i think i see something  matt okay following this little chain of lights that pop and glow as it goes eventually you come  upon the first signs of stone rubble some sort of structure was built here long ago and has since  fallen over and elements of its masonry either moved or reclaimed for other structures elsewhere  on the island but you can see the basis of walls and joining positions where elements of this  previous building were /town/ used to maintain and hold the ceiling that has since fallen in there is a  series of walked paths that carved through the various ferns and heavy bush but you do find the  back of one of these walls where jamedi says this is where i slept previously perhaps this is  the best place to rest so he begins to set up a small tent arranging against the wall what do  you guys do  liam do we want it just to be us and they have the tent  sam kind of i mean is /none/ that rude  taliesin they didnt bring any tents for us  laura but remember that you can hear through the bubble remember still though okay so we cant  talk bad about them though  travis i think maybe we invite them in and one of us keeps out  laura but do it like do you want to stay with us but do it like this  sam do you want to ask them with that stink face  laura yeah  sam okay  laura captain avantika and jamedi did you want to stay with us in /town/ the bubble  sam theres no facilities or anything  laura its stinky in there but if you want to  matt jamedi goes i am unfamiliar with what this bubble is you speak of  laura its whatever its a little bubble  sam its like a tent  laura its like a tent basically  matt i am okay he heads back to configuring his tent avantika tilts her head and goes i  assume this is some sort of protective measure for your nights rest  laura mmhmm  matt then i would be delighted to join /none/ you  sam i mean dont feel like youre obligated  matt believe me it is my honor  laura great cool  matt sheathes the rapier but keeps the dagger drawn turned around in her hand so its face down  and looks over her shoulder both ways out towards the darkness so how spacious is this as you  finish the spell the strange colored orb appears there on the side of the ruins  liam at the surroundings here or what were behind a little bit of stone ruins or  matt yeah theres a couple of /none/ small stone elements there  liam then its gray the same color as the stone i have control of the color also out of  curiosity i am a transmutation wizard so do i have a sense of how old the stone surrounding us is  matt the stone here make an intelligence check  liam ugh bad roll 12  matt you dont have specific information on it its quite old it might be older than this age  might have existed precalamity or at least somewhere in that neighborhood but youre not  entirely certain  taliesin mr /none/ caleb want to take a walk maybe really quickly around this thing get a gander at it  liam the thing is if i exit this bubble now then it goes away  taliesin oh then ill just report back in a minute  liam i could do it again  taliesin no thats okay better safe than sorry ill let you know when i see  laura do you want company do you need anyone with you  taliesin oh id love company actually just in case  laura okay beau nott whispering keep an eye on them okay /none/ let me know what happens  travis on who  laura shut up i mean  sam on who our friends  laura yeah just forget it lets go  taliesin well take a look around this thing and i also want to cast another detect undead while  were walking  matt youre going to look around what  taliesin im going to take a walk around this little ruin im going to have the little light  spell up see if theres any writing on anything any carvings im going to have eyes of the grave  up /none/ again im going to be looking for any undead  matt okay and youre accompanying him  laura im watching his back  matt the rest of you are staying within the sphere gray color dimly lit on the interior it  can be whatever light source you want at this point the two of you wander around the ruin make  an investigation check if you dont mind  laura can i help does that make it easier  taliesin you roll too maybe  laura okay nope  taliesin 12  laura one im not very observant today /none/ okay ive got things on my mind  matt okay as you walk through and pore over the ruins the structure is fairly simple this wasnt  some beautifullymade stone hall most of the stones here were probably pulled from rivers or  were smoothed over and theyre varying sizes and the masonry is very simple  taliesin couldnt figure what its a temple to or any  matt not particularly you dont know if its a temple it could have been an abode it doesnt  appear to be huge there seem to be one or two adjacent rooms /none/ that were set in that space  taliesin and nothing from the detect undead  matt nothing from the detect undead no  taliesin other than what i already expect to see  matt no  taliesin what i expect to see is still giving off a little glow right  matt correct whats the range on that  taliesin 60 feet although i will say divination magic would also blind me to that and if it was  full cover i would possibly not see it as well  matt right understood caduceus whats your armor class  taliesin /none/ 17  matt as youre looking over the stonework and turning to jester to mention you didnt see much  taliesin the funny thing is  matt impact there is a shape that moves out of the shadows with incredible speed the light the  faint color being emanated from caduceus cantrip immediately falls away and you see the streak of  his hair disappear in the nearby shadow i need you to make a strength saving throw  laura like hes gone hes just gone in front of me  matt you watched him be pushed off into a /none/ nearby bush  marisha football tackled just gone okay  taliesin ten  matt thats a fail you get pushed off land on the ground you tumble and are held prone on the  ground as what little bit of light you can see not having darkvision unfortunately what you  see is a faint glimmer of two large white fangs a smattering of whiskers right before you this  growl sound and a cluster of snake heads that bend around each side of the head  travis i just peed a little  matt the bite attack hits you /none/ that is only five points of piercing damage actually it gets  advantage on the second one okay with the advantage it does hit and the other one the  snakes all snap onto you multiple snake bites all biting across your face and your throat for  that you suffer eight points of piercing damage and you need to make a constitution saving throw please  sam mr clay  taliesin i mean come on  matt ooh  laura oh no dont make that sound matthew  taliesin and i need to make a constitution saving throw  /none/ sam youve got this mr clay  travis come on snitch  taliesin 15  matt thats a success you take half damage you only take 12 points of poison damage  travis oh my god  laura but hes not poisoned  matt correct jester you see the shape and you glance over and you can see with your darkvision  this tenfootlong leopardlike cat that is currently now pressed onto the chest and body of  caduceus it bites down towards him and all these strange protrusions from around the shoulders and  head area all strike down /none/ as a few of them curl back and look at you and in that bit you can see  a few beats of light faint bits of starlight and moon that are coming down and reflecting in the  eyes of these snake heads and you hear this growling up behind you on the ruin where you  were just standing ill be right back  travis we got ambushed  laura what do we do  sam clever girl  laura oh no  travis how far away are you guys  laura i dont know if were very /town/ far i dont think were very far away  liam they went to do a perimeter sweep  sam find out about these beasts on dd beyond  travis oh shit that means theres probably more than two  sam look at these palm trees  laura this is really cool though  matt caduceus you are over here jester you are here  travis yeah  matt now the rest of you are over so jamedis over here in his tent the rest of you are all  clustered inside the hut caduceus  laura oh god its so /tavern/ scary its a leopard with snake heads  marisha its a leopard with snakes  travis why would you make that  sam thats someone who was drunk at night and was like lets just do this thing  matt i need everyone to roll initiative technically you guys dont hear anything so well  see when it comes around your turn  marisha wait what what do you mean we dont hear anything you said we heard through the bubble  matt you hear sounds but theres been no sound yet you guys have been setting yourselves up for /none/  the evening there the only person that would have probably noticed would have been caduceus  travis and he is getting fucked up right now  liam the good news is were totally safe in this bubble and nothing can happen to us  sam and both of our clerics  travis both our healers are outside typical  matt 25 to 20  marisha wow cool  travis nobody  sam oh someone roll for yasha  matt if you want to get that  travis seven plus i got to get her sheet  matt yes you /none/ do  travis i think its nine  laura i need a turkish delight before i die  matt 25 to 20 nobody 20

drei vier  matt beau youre up first but you have not noticed anything so your turn is spent fluffing  your space to sleep for the evening  marisha you know what fjord i think jester is a little jealous just throwing it out there  travis jealous jealous of what  marisha shit are you fucking serious right now  liam six seconds done  matt caduceus  taliesin im going to yell for help and then im going to  matt you /none/ all immediately hear  taliesin help then im going to tap my staff to wake up my beetles as my bonus action my beetles  are going to make a bite attack on that i actually have that information now thanks to the update  sam on dd beyond  taliesin on dd beyond  sam wow  taliesin so thats a swarm attack they have a bite thats plus three to hit i believe thats a 13  matt 13

even  paler and a little gaunter and im going to grab it and im going to cast im so panicked  vampiric touch  travis i like it get some of that shit back  taliesin so since im in contact with it  matt its a melee spell attack  taliesin melee spell attack  matt go ahead and roll for an attack  taliesin what is a melee attack here  matt its a d20 plus /none/ your spell attack modifier  taliesin okay plus eight 20  matt 20 hits go ahead and roll damage for the vampiric touch  taliesin oh man this is mean  matt theyre next and then jester youre up  laura okay  taliesin thats 3d6 thats counting ten points of necrotic damage and i regain five hit points  travis atta boy  matt as you reach up your hand grasps its throat and this strange hissing sound happens as you pull  life force energy out of it its strange threads of purplishblack energy that pull into your /none/ body  your wounds healing up slightly  laura so i can see that huh  matt you can see a faint bit of energy coming out of caduceus  taliesin help  matt is that your turn  taliesin that is unless i can try and move away  matt youre prone so its half movement to try and crawl away or you can spend half your  movement to get up and then you still have half your movement to try and escape if you want  taliesin im going to try and half my movement to get /none/ up  matt all righty so you get up from prone  laura well thats good i thought he was like on top of you  taliesin im going to back up against you  matt to here  laura wont he get an attack of opportunity  taliesin will he get an attack of opportunity  matt

once  marisha just once can i stun it  matt yeah all right constitution saving throw that is a natural one so you miss the first  strike but as you roundhouse kick you manage to kick right up in its abdomen you feel ribs break  and /none/ buckle under the impact of the kick some sort of chain reaction spirals across its nervous  system as it falls to its side it is stunned until the end of your next turn  marisha im going to spend another ki point and do flurry of blows for my bonus action  matt yes you can do that yes  marisha and do pop pop two more punches  matt go for it you have advantage on these i believe yep  marisha first attack ill take that natural 17 which im pretty sure hits for nine damage and /none/  then second attack is a natural 20 thank you gil roll two dice

/none/ feel any sort of muscular resistance as your fist sinks  about an inch or two into its body you pull back it doesnt break the skin but you can feel you  hurt some meaty organs in the inside does that finish your turn beau  marisha yes  matt all right caduceus  taliesin so theres a stunned one behind me a stunned one on one side of me and a notstunned  one on the other  matt correct

and  its trying to back away its unable to move from where it is its speed is reduced to zero so it  turns to now look at the two unconscious figures on the ground that one is stunned so it cant do  anything jester youre up youre asleep  /none/ laura i dream  matt avantika cant do anything shes asleep jamedi is going to move here next to the trees for  cover hes going to reload his shortbow and

to do this  travis shell see it sit there and shell reach up high and shell try and cleave off the front  of the jaguars head in one downward swing  matt the body attempts to leap and the head stumbles underneath with some of the snake heads  the momentum carries it but it runs straight into the base of the tree crossing the way before impact  on the ground the head still growling coming to rest on the ground  travis she still has one more attack can she use the rest of her movement /none/ to move towards the  jaguar i think she has ten feet of her movement  matt she could yeah if she has the rest of her movement she can use it to move up  travis is that melee or just outside of it  matt its melee  travis oh great reckless as well 21  matt that hits  travis yeah 14 points of damage

natural creature make a general intelligence check  liam thats better thats a 20  matt 20 they dont appear to be theyre more intelligent than some creatures in nature but  there isnt any sort of  liam still animalistic  matt yeah still animalistic /none/ they are natural to this island at the very least  liam knowing that i would recommend that if i make the bubble again even if some more of them  come as long as we stay safe for the next ten minutes if they come we will be still and  sleeping and all they would see is a round stone theyre animals they will leave  travis agreed we should rally up backtoback while caleb casts it  sam are we going to leave the two dead animal bodies right here next to where were camping  because /none/ that could stink  laura well move over to where our bubble was before how about that  sam okay  taliesin ill start them going too so that wont be a thing for very long  travis and marisha start them going  liam i will begin my ritual spell in the same

grabs a few things from the tent and its a very tight space nine creatures is the  max right youve hit the maximum you all manage to fit in there in a not terribly comfortable space  liam tenfoot radius so 20 from one side to the other  travis i still think one of us should stay up in shifts inside this bubble just in case  liam ja ill take the first shift im good im very jittery tonight  sam ill stay up with you  liam frumpkin by the way /none/ is flitting about a little bit from person to person while we talk  even lands on avantikas shoulder a little bit and does a little  laura i bring sprinkle out from inside my hood and make sure he was okay during that whole fight  matt sprinkle who is not necessarily used to the type of weather appears to be very uncomfortable  in the heat and being tucked into the cloth and is like chittering  laura i give him some water and some little food  travis what are you doing to that poor dog  /none/ laura im sorry buddy kissing  matt this is the crimson weasel the dog is with the ruby of the sea  travis eh whatever  liam entschuldigung im sorry now the owl is pitterpatting on avantikas hat  matt just walking along the hat  liam not constantly

first /none/ watch guys  sam were inside the bubble right  matt yeah  laura but you can hear things  sam 12  liam one also were being very quiet because we dont want to be heard but while were in here  frumpkin over a period of ten or 15 minutes you see this goes pitterpatting along the ground  and hops onto avantikas boot  matt okay  liam pitterpattering eventually stands on top of her dagger and i cast identify through touch  of my familiar and he weighs one ounce  matt yeah thats true  /none/ travis one ounce is good  taliesin one ounce owl its the best band  marisha the one ounce owl  matt avantika who as mentioned before was sleeping with one eye open essentially is rested  there and then right as you begin to go through the actions of casting there is a flash of motion  laura gasps oh no  matt what is frumpkins armor class  liam oh im sure its terrible hold on a second  sam go to the creature tab on dd beyond  liam i am it is 11  matt frumpkin /none/ suffers five points of piercing damage as avantika instinctually slashing panting  liam why did you do that  matt why did you do that  liam you know why i did that  matt and you know why i did that  liam ey  matt be glad it was just your owl please do not go peering where it is not wanted eh  liam okay dont mind me while i make another owl i begin casting find familiar to bring back  frumpkin as a oneounce owl  laughter  matt recycling frumpkin  liam i promised /none/ beauregard an owl for a week so i cant have my cat back ten minutes later  theres an owl watch is over  matt you finish your watch seemingly uneventful towards the tail end of it you do see a shape of  another one of those leopardlike creatures that stalks on the outskirts of the strange opaque orb  youve created and approaches it sniffing circles around it for a bit prods at it every now  and then spends about 40 minutes or so keeping a watch and then eventually loses interest and  wanders off into /none/ the jungle  travis cool  liam whispering i like cats  sam not that kind  matt all right next watch whos taking next watch we only need one more watch i think jester  laura on the way because i got a pretty good amount of sleep during that fight can i ask  caleb before he goes to sleep hey caleb  liam yeah  laura could we stick things through the bubble  liam ja you can go out and in and you can sorry you can put your

across the opposite way and  youre watching this way over his shoulder and hes looking over yours and doesnt engage in  conversation unless you wish to  laura have you ever seen those cat things before  matt i have seen them my first time passing through here yes but i was quieter  laura yeah were pretty loud sometimes  matt you are correct this has been a bit more challenging than i originally anticipated  /none/ laura have you thought at all about the traveler  matt no  laura do you want a pamphlet  matt i am confused as to what you are speaking of  laura whispering the traveler  matt you are strange  laura hes everywhere  matt and creepy  laura hes really great ill give you a pamphlet i get it out and i walk it over to him here  matt it takes a solid ten seconds of him inspecting it and looking up at you before he  laura just read it over theres a lot of /none/ information in there its really important  matt much appreciated  laura hes here right now  matt tucks it away into the inside of his vest  laura traveler if youre here you should show him youre here so that he will like you even more  than he already does just give it a minute  matt farting noise youre not quite sure who it was on that side that let one loose in their  sleep but the inside of the dome suddenly has a very fragrant air  sam dutch oven  liam to be fair /none/ we all had indian for dinner tonight so it could be any one of us  laura he has cast his blessing upon us  matt really the most impressive of miracles  laura how long have you been working for captain avantika  matt only for this journey and once before  laura do you like her a lot  matt she pays well does not judge  laura what were you doing before you were working for her  matt working for other people  laura whats

the empire  laura im from the menagerie coast actually  matt all right  laura so that far  matt i have delved into a few ruins i have been lucky enough to survive by working alone i have  seen many friends fall and disappear but i have made my way whats the craziest thing you have seen  laura ever in my life  matt sure  laura oh shit /none/ ive seen some crazy shit this one time i saw a bug carrying a piece of bread  that was like five times its size and he was carrying it up stairs like up and then he would  turn and then it would go up and then he would turn  matt will wonders ever cease  laughter  matt im going to concentrate on our surroundings for the remainder of our shift if you  do not mind  laura me too  matt he looks out now towards the tail end of your shift as the sunlight /none/ begins to slowly peak  liam its a slow roll laughter it took a minute and then it caught like fire  laughter  matt there is some more shifting in the nearby bushes and you see two figures beginning to  approach the sphere  laura whispering oh shit  matt shh he gets his short bow ready and nocks an arrow  laura whispering if they stab through  matt maybe just shh as you guys wait you can see similar to what you had previously seen in  your travels on this island two lizard men armored /none/ one carrying a net thats slung over his  shoulder the other with a long spear both with shields off to the side not ready for aggression  but they both approach slowly towards the strange sphere and begin inspecting it  laura whispering i put my hand on fjords leg  sam upper thigh  laura shh  matt lizard men talking he pokes it with the spear the other one steps forward and licks it  they both begin to walk around and inspect it prod and poke it jamedi you can see hes just  looking out /none/ very intensely bow notched  laura whispering i poke beau  matt they both circle around the back end of it poke the dome a few more times one of them picks  up a rock and throws it at it it skips off of the exterior of it and rests in a nearby bush they  both step forward one more time and smell it closely they both turn around and begin to make  their way in the opposite direction of where the dome is set making their way further into the  jungle clearing one of them /none/ stops and looks back behind one more time at the dome and turns back  and both of them vanish into the nearby brush  laura is it getting light yet  matt it is theres no sign of the sun but its that early morning soft blue that starting to  overtake the evenings night  laura we should wake up everybody should wake up we should get out of here before they come  back with more people  sam who  laura there were i think i couldnt tell they were shadowy but i think they were /none/ like lizard  men or snake men  sam oh gosh  taliesin all right  laura could you tell  matt i would say that they are probably very close to the ones we saw before  laura which ones the lizard men or the snake men  matt they appear to be of the lizard men heritage  laura we should get out of here even though the lizard men are obviously the weaker of the two caleb  liam hm  laura we should get up and get out of here  liam yeah okay  marisha /town/ they know where we are they can ambush us  sam did we get a long rest  matt you did get a long rest  sam oh good  liam okay well say the word and ill

jungles as the low mist in the jungle begins to burn away as the day itself grows warmer all of  you getting a bit more adjusted to the temperature and general atmosphere beau youre feeling a  little rough  marisha ah  sam what  matt you get this sweating a /none/ little bit and this soreness in your body and this general body pain  kind of a dull pain throughout  liam youve got mono  marisha nope

matt there you go caleb  liam 30  laura 34  taliesin 15  matt okay and then yasha natural 18 not bad  sam wow stealthy mofos  matt you guys are cruising your way through the jungle and using that score as you approach  jamedi with his hand out behind /town/ him stopping you glancing just past his shoulder you can see the  jungle trees begin to clear and the first thing that catches your eye beyond this treeline you  can see a few dozen scattered stone buildings most of them in relatively good shape immediately  coming into view you can see the stone coloration is more of a sandstone yellowish to a dull gray  and white with different materials used to accent elements of the constructions this doesnt match  the ruins you previously slept in the night before these appear to be fresher you can /none/ see  the verdant green jungle vines and roots begin to entwine and tangle near the base of some of them  and where its built looks like parts of the jungle have grown up around and helped camouflage  elements of this small village you can see elements of the exposed stone carry snakehead  obelisks that appear to be softly carved from bits of a marble material or recovered stone in a  similar way that most of the construction has been done  sam does it look like the figurine that i recovered earlier  matt similar /none/ sculpt and design though larger and of more detail you see these obelisks about ten  feet tall and they tend to be markers at different intersections of travel you can see probably a  dozen or so folk immediately at this position that youre at that are wandering through this city  some are gathering materials you can see actually up the way across one of these walls you  see four figures that are strung up by their feet you can see the remnants of the lizard men that  are in the process of having the flesh /none/ filleted from their bodies  all moans of disgust  matt you see one of the more humanoid ones probably one of the hunters that you saw alongside  the snakearmed man is there with the blade stripping it off the bones and sloughing it into a  pile next to it where you hear squelching over on top of each other  laura oh thats fucked up what do the obelisk eyes look like  matt make a perception check  laura eight  matt hard to tell at this distance youd have to get a lot closer  /none/ laura okay  taliesin whos got the mote this morning who moted who dodecaed  laura oh dang we were going to pass it around  marisha we were yeah  liam its somewhere in the building well find it  marisha okay  sam give it to fjord again this is his day  laura okay fjord  travis well i was going to  laura stare at it look into its eyes  travis you dont want to give it to caduceus  taliesin i will not say no to it  laura look into its eyes  /none/ travis give it to him  taliesin i dont know oh  laughter  matt all right you take your mote of possibility  liam and we are hanging back at this point but not in the thick of it were seeing this all from  a distance i was thinking about spells yeah  marisha remember if anything goes down fjord and i will take point caduceus i noticed before it  seemed like you guys were poisoned immediately but not lingering  taliesin oh yeah im feeling fine  marisha are you im not like saying anything  /none/ taliesin why  marisha what  taliesin you seem a little  marisha nope  taliesin you sure  marisha yep  taliesin i can do a  marisha nope great  sam do you feel okay  marisha yeah  taliesin does she look okay  matt make a medicine check  taliesin 22  matt looking at her while all of you are fairly warm and sweaty her complexion is paler than you  recall there is quite a bit of sweat more so than expected that is streaming down her body  her vision appears to be /none/ not as focused and shes not making eye contact with you as she speaks to  you lids are a bit droopy she doesnt look healthy  taliesin you dont look okay are you sure you really dont look okay  marisha fuck you  travis okay  taliesin well  travis there might be some leeches in this jungle maybe some ticks  taliesin im just offering something medicinal  liam im ritual casting through this discussion  matt what are you casting  liam comprehend languages  marisha do you see red stripes  taliesin no  marisha /none/ i feel stripey i dont know why  taliesin youre clammy and  laura should we try to  sam and laura heal you or something  marisha im great im awesome are you itchy  laura okay you havent been around her as much when she tells you dont do something well  usually dont do it but okay thats weird  sam maybe its a human thing  laura shes hiding that shes actually not okay  taliesin hold on  marisha sulky no  taliesin you should take this  marisha sulkier no  sam is it /none/ tea what is that  travis yeah what is it give her mushrooms  taliesin take a look at this just want to take a look smell it does it smell bad  marisha yeah you smell bad  taliesin its a clever distraction im touching her and casting lesser restoration dont think  ive never done this before  travis smell this bip  matt okay you finish casting the spell the energy subsides you pull back and theres no  change in her demeanor  laura oh no  marisha dont touch me  taliesin i apologize thats /none/ weird though  laura oh im sorry i was wrong shes just a bitch  marisha i get that a lot  taliesin you really dont look okay just for fun really quickly  matt based on your medicine check it looks to be not a toxin this is more of a disease taking hold  taliesin just out of curiosity one check for undead really quickly  marisha im diseased  laura oh no beau  matt for the time being just as a note as this is coming to be noticed all of your constitution  saving throws /none/ are at disadvantage  marisha oh great  travis did you get hit in the fight  taliesin no  marisha no i just  laura you must have caught something from weird bugs  taliesin does eyes of the grave show anything here  matt no  taliesin okay  laura oh you got malaria  taliesin all right i did what i can does it seem contagious  matt not from what you can tell youre not entirely certain what the disease is  laura oh no beau im just not going to stand near you okay  /none/ marisha thats okay  matt its some sort of an insectdistributed jungle ailment  marisha its the con plague we just got back from new york  taliesin you joke but like a third of our people are down its very empty out there  matt yeah  liam its just ed  travis and nanny fell too  matt but at least she got to watch our driver almost beat up that guy  travis thats true  taliesin too much for me  travis didnt know the incredible hulk was in this motherfucker did you  matt that /none/ was amazing anyway back to task  taliesin yeah just be careful what you touch for a little while we need  marisha im always careful with what i touch ive lets just keep moving  matt as you guys slightly press forward jamedi showing you a bit of a path off to the side he  glances towards the path where he was going and one thing that catches your attention is youve  seen the men with the snake arms youve seen the folk with the scaled skin patches what you see  now towards this one stairway /none/ portion that now leads to what you previously didnt see below the  tree line but a massive stone structure beset by these stairs on each of its five sides envision  like a semblance of an aztec pyramid but a fiveside shape that levels off at the top and  there are stairs on each of these five sides at the base of the nearest one you see less of a man  and more of a giant snake maybe twelve to fifteen feet long coiled and muscular but to a humanoid  torso with two heavy loglike arms /town/ that rest at its sides one resting on this large sheathed  scimitarlike blade its head curled up into this heavy straight serpent snakelike mouth as its  jaw kind of hangs open and its tongue hissing noise its just keeping an eye and it slithers  across the road bowing from side to side as it looks across the tree line  travis at the base of the structure its doing that  matt the base of the structure youre seeing a variety of these snake people going about their  lives this one is just keeping a watch /none/ in that one element and jamedi you can hear curse under  his breath it was the path i took to the inside last time were going to have to improvise which  way do you want to go  sam were trying to get into the center of this all of this  matt avantikas like of course inside that big thing right there  travis okay so if ill go over to jamedi if we can clear him is the path youve taken before  clear as far as you can see i dont know which way you /none/ went  matt as far as i can remember it was fairly clear but it is also i had to ensure that there  was not many watching they have these like right there he points over the side and you can  see along the stairs almost like a withered person you see them like a smaller  human hunched forward their body a light green tint to itself kind of this wrinkled scaled  body its neck protruding and curved outward it looks what a like the lizard folk you had seen  earlier but with a longer /none/ neck and almost geriatric in the way they carry themselves  forward lumbering carrying a large spear and appears to be watching like a sentinel across the  upper portion of this large stone structure  laura so its got a lizard face not like a human face with a really long neck  matt from what you can tell from this distance its hard to see but it looks to be more serpent  and more snakelike  laura like the beetlejuice part where his head goes  travis can anyone create a distraction that doesnt put their own /town/ person at risk  sam sure  marisha jester  matt and you can see theres about four or so buildings between where you are and the base of  the structure theres a small village that surrounds the base of this temple and so you guys  have to find your way through this city  laura this city without being seen theres a big group of us  travis its not us clearing and then the building theres stuff  laura can we make ourselves look like the snake people  sam sure some us can  marisha /dung/ i cant  travis although we could throw you in a net and act like you were dinner  sam yes yes  marisha okay  laura whats wrong with that  travis whos got a net  laura hey you two can you make yourself look like snake people  matt avantika goes uh that is not really a specialty of mine however im very good at not  being seen and jamedi goes its also my specialty perhaps we can come from a different  direction smaller group the two of us can meet on the way  /none/ marisha you know what maybe i could go with them  liam i did not prepare the spell to disguise myself i thought we would be fighting monster  people so  marisha such a bitch sucks  liam what  marisha saying that as a person im just commiserating moving on  liam are you marisha or  marisha i was yeah how about i go with these guys with jamedi and avantika  matt they both look at you and say the whole point of this was to make it a small group the  more we add /none/ to this group the harder it is for us to do this  marisha three is a small group  laura can you be invisible  travis how many of us can change one two three four  sam but not these two  travis awesome great two of us one each take tie them up in rope  sam as prisoners theyre humans theyre disgusting filthy pink skins  laura but still we move really stealthily  sam oh wait yasha  matt yashas just sitting there with her arms crossed just listening to the whole conversation going  /none/ sam can you change your appearance  matt i mean kind of  travis kind of  laura i dont think she can do it like we think  matt like the wings  travis yeah thats less of what were looking for  sam we could make a distraction some of us can snakey  laura maybe we do separate into smaller groups and try to stealth it  sam the ones who cant change can go first and well make a distraction and then the ones who can  can just walk in after  travis yeah  /none/ laura oh my god okay  liam comforting  sam youll have yasha with you and beau to protect you  taliesin but without you theyre not going to be as sneaky we have to stay together if were going  to want to be super stealthy  laura thats a really good point  taliesin together probably is better  sam they wont have to be sneaky if we make enough of a distraction right  laura what if we dont make a distraction we make them look like prisoners we still try to be  sneaky but then /none/ if were caught then we have an excuse  sam all right all in favor of that plan  travis sure  sam thats one vote  travis yeah  liam what do we think that these beings reaction will be to not lizardpeople being on this island  all of a sudden  taliesin or for that matter if we cant speak to them  laura i think they will probably try to  liam you think its an every day or every week or month occurrence i think were probably pretty  special here  laura i think /none/ they might try to kill us and then eat us like that guy over there  travis i think we should try and be as sneaky as possible if for some reason shit hits the fan i  can make a pretty i think spectacular distraction that doesnt put me or us at risk but  i think we should try stealth first  taliesin stealth with a couple emergency backup snake looking people  travis stealth distraction fuck shit up cool  marisha okay so  sam can you make a distraction far away from us  travis yeah /none/  marisha if caleb and i move together you have your message spell that you can send back and  forth to nott  taliesin we all have to move together  marisha oh thats what were doing  laura well you guys arent as stealthy without being within 30 feet of me  sam oh boy  marisha maybe we do the live bait thing i dont know  travis what act like youre tied up  marisha maybe  travis yeah well do it anyway  taliesin thats if they see us  travis well tie your hands /none/ in the front  taliesin if they dont see us it doesnt matter what they look like  marisha okay okay  liam i think that if anyone that looks like me or you shows up on this island anyone who sees it  is going to come asking questions immediately  travis i agree  laura what if do any of the people we see walking around do any of them wear cloaks  matt make a perception check  travis thats not a bad thought  laura 14  matt looking around you dont see many cloaks the /none/ weather here is warm enough to the point where  there isnt the need to bundle theres no need for hoods because the society here wants to make  sure they can very quickly identify whos a part of their faction and who isnt so yeah theres  no cloaks you see what are like open robes simple bits of cloth just to cover aspects of the  body for protection from the sun or otherwise but beyond that its mostly just skin and scales  laura but there are some people that look just like people  matt there /town/ are people that look mostly like people from a distance but upon closer look  their skin in places that gets a greener hue in patches their eyes are yellow very snakelike  eyes sharper teeth  laura i will use my disguise kit and try to make it look like theyve got scales on them they will  probably know the people in their own fucking village though lets be honest  travis are there several dozen people or is it  matt now that youve watched the first view you had was only the first few buildings in /town/ front of  you now that youve stepped forward and glanced you can see theres maybe about 30 to 40 buildings  that sit around the base of this entire temple youve seen a few dozen in the streets so the  society here you can assume somewhere in the neighborhood of like one to three hundred people  live in the city total  travis lets do that yeah  marisha thats a lot of people  travis ill use mask of many faces to look like one of those fucks and lets try to paint some  scales /none/ on the nonchangeling folks  laura makes blipping noises  matt okay so youre applying them to yasha and beau and caleb  liam and the clothes weve seen on these people are like what theyre purple robes youve mentioned  matt purple robes simple cloth skirts most of the whole thing thats worn there is for general  protection and adornment you can see jewelry adorning some of them but its very simple and  its more for purpose than anything extravagant or presentational  liam groaning i begin to put ugh my spell books into fjords bag  /none/ travis of holding  liam yeah i cant have ornate book holsters and ugh trying to make myself look as simple as possible  laura disguise self  matt avantika goes ill be watching au revoir and she kind of  travis where are you going where are we meeting at the temple at the top  matt i figure the top of that would be a very effective place to meet is that not correct that  is where you entered last time non she turns to jamedi whos keeping low to the ground and  goes that is /none/ indeed where i was there is a room inside there i could not walk into i could not  find a way through that is when i returned so well meet there avantika goes au revoir  waves her hand through the air and marks a few symbols and you watch as she disappears  liam i had that spell once  sam are these guys painted green is that what were doing  matt thats what were going to find out right now youre proficient with your disguise kit so  its proficiency bonus plus ill say dexterity check /none/ to see how well you can apply these details  to their bodies roll for each one of them  liam ill look like a 1980s halloween costume come on  matt for caleb  marisha state fair all the way  liam make me look like spiderman  laura eight  matt caleb has these green circles on his face in splotches and youre like great for beau  laura okay thats way better 17  matt beau actually pretty good job the linework and shading you had done in these various  patches on the inside of the /none/ brow line helps make her look a little more snakelike youve sunken  the jowls youve done the scattered patches with the patchmarks  liam you look pretty convincing how do i look  marisha polio  laura now that im seeing how good i did on beau im realizing how shitty caleb is but im not  going to tell him  liam what do you mean what did you say  matt yasha seems strangely excited me next me next  laura okay okay oh  travis is that a one shit god why did you roll out /none/ that big fucker  sam it was good before  laura this ones from sam  matt you guys look amongst yourselves while shes working on yasha and finally she finishes and  voila pulls back and its just grinch just green head to toe bright green its pretty bad  but you feel pretty confident about it  laura you look amazing its a really good color on you  matt yasha goes okay lets do this  sam im going to grab caleb and be like youre going to be fine out there its going to be fine /none/  just think like a lizard right  laura what do you mean she looks bad i think she looks really good caleb  sam im going to take some flowers and just stick one in his hair for good luck  liam is that better  sam i dont know its good luck though  liam i lean in way in to notts ear and say whispering oh by the way caduceus says that  jamedi is actually a dead thing  sam what what no but what shit why are we following him then  marisha i lean /none/ in and say are we whispering now we whispering again  sam no theyre gone  liam whispering i was telling nott that jamedi is a dead thing caduceus says jamedis dead  marisha what  liam whispering keep it on the dl  marisha the deadlow  sam why are we following him  laura just because hes dead doesnt mean hes a bad guy  liam whispering are you whispering too  laura yes of course i am  liam whispering we dont have a choice  sam what if he came here was killed and was sent /none/ to come get us to bring us back as feeding  for whatevers down there  liam whispering what if we let the pirate queen tie rocks to our feet and were dead we have to  do this we can kill them later  travis agreed  matt agreed  sam ah youre still here shit  matt well i hadnt left yet i was curious to see your  sam did you know where are you  matt you dont see the voice is coming from nowhere  sam is jamedi here  matt make a perception check /none/  sam 18  matt looking around you do not see jamedi immediately in the vicinity  marisha is he on speakerphone  matt no this is avantika  sam avantika did you know he was dead  taliesin specifically he was not telling you because i knew you were going to panic  sam did you know he was a dead guy  matt i was not aware but now i am very curious as to where you found this information and what  you think this means  taliesin i just know things i dont know what it /none/ means i was trying to find a moment to figure out  if you knew or if we should tell you or if this was part of some sort of plan i hadnt figured it  out and for some reason i had not realized that i was walking around with a bunch of gossips  well its what i get i suppose for trying to be sneaky about things  travis nice job hes going to fucking leave again good job  marisha whose side are you on  taliesin ive been doing my best not to be thrown /none/ by it it seems like hes been standing up all right  matt hes done work for me before and was successful  laura hes pretty cool  sam has he always been dead is this a recent thing where are you  matt dont worry about it but nevertheless he has done his job so far i assume we just keep a  close eye if ever he decides to give any sign of turning on any of us well its eight against one  travis indeed ill take out several feet of rope from the bag of holding /none/ and say we should do this  before he achieves the destination forward  matt see you on the other side and you watch as the dust puffing the footprints  taliesin this is why i was trying to keep it on the downlow  sam why  taliesin i knew that certain members of the party may get a little excited i myself had a moment  of panic had a moment of panic myself ive been keeping it contained  laura you feel okay now  taliesin no theres a dead guy walking around with us thats unsettling /none/ thats unsettling to  my very core ive got to admit but you know  laura well now we just have to go walk around snake people and not be seen so thats fine  taliesin its an improvement at the very least  marisha hey fjord avantika can go invisible or peek into what were saying can you do that  travis no well kind of not really no  marisha how much have you heard  travis i mean i can pop in and out but  liam weve seen you flit about  travis yeah that one /none/  laura but you cant hear whats on the other side when youre popping in and out can you oh yes  you can thats right you can  taliesin how many fingers am i holding up  travis none  taliesin oh i forgot to im really distracted right now i dont know why i bother  laura we should probably get pretty snaking on here  travis well put two in the front two in the back and put these three in the  laura in the middle  matt your pass without a trace has probably faded /none/ at this point with the travel youve made so you  have to recast it to get the spell bonus  laura you guys we should probably do it again  taliesin mmhmm  liam yeah  laura singing pass pass pass papass i give yasha the blessing of the trickster  travis good call  matt everyone make a stealth check please  marisha hang on hang on real quick clearing throat real talk for just a second if yasha  comes with us and we puppet her and she dies ashleys going to be real mad just pointing /none/ this  out last time because we did this with pike not saying one way or the other just saying were  going to continue on with yasha okay done done thats all im going to say  sam shes going to be in a defensive stance for most of the fight  travis shell be fine ill pilot her  laura i would say lets text her but shes in another country so she probably wouldnt get it  matt stealth checks guys  travis 21  marisha fuck  travis pass without a trace  marisha 20  /town/ liam 25  sam oh i get advantage 30 no 38  liam rogues man rogues  travis what natural one  taliesin 26  sam shes a lizard person shell be fine  matt and for yasha if you want to roll twice  travis 25 natural 15  laura at least i look like a snake person  sam youre going to be a loud snake person thats fine  matt you all begin to make your way towards the first set of buildings theres that one  individual thats flaying the bodies of the lizardmen has made /town/ their way through two of them  there are two more that are in the process of being stripped there is one street that breaks  through two of the ones closest to you do you wish to take that path what do you wish to do to  stealth in because part of the pathway here is out in the open so youd have to gauge your timing  travis describe the two again  matt where you are now towards the main stairway that leads at the top you have about two streets  or three sets of /town/ buildings to get through the ones closest to you there are two large buildings  that are immediately towards your side one side has nobody around it the other one has one  individual that is currently flaying the hanging corpses of the four lizardmen  travis i vote for the one guy flaying the lizardmen  marisha agreed  laura because hes distracted  travis mmhmm and its one guy  laura the other one has no guys  travis that never is no guys  laura okay i follow your lead captain  travis lets go that way /none/ well go towards the flaying  matt okay you make your way exiting the jungle way and are you going quickly and quietly so  nobody notices or are you strolling through using your stealth as a means of trying to keep any sort of  travis trying to blend in  matt got you okay all of you move forward are you dragging them behind by ropes  marisha no were in the middle were assassins creeding it  matt got you  travis if there is a building to walk beside i would prefer to have our shittily /none/ drawn and one  very nice one closest to the building with us on the outside  marisha uhhuh yeah ill be the barrier  travis mama elephants and then baby elephants  marisha aww yeah  matt you guys cluster and begin to shift as this herd of snakefolk making your way towards that direction  travis oh god oh god oh god  matt as the light hits you as you leave the branches of the jungle and begin shifting fully  open now in the middle of the midday sun immediately you feel the heat on the /tavern/ back of your  neck and shoulders begin to grow hotter and hotter as the nerves build up inside you cruise through  the open area and to the left you hear a whip cracking you glance over and you can see another  one of those massive mostlysnake serpentine hulking individuals is currently wielding a whip  there is a cluster of lizardmen that are currently chained and are currently pushing on a heavy bar  that is dragging a large piece of stone out of the jungle and towards the center of the city theyre  bent into /none/ slave labor for these people they are now pushing it forward that catches you off guard  for a minute but you continue to focus and move forward as you get closer you can hear the slick  sound of the flesh being pulled from the back of the lizardmans body wet ripping  travis aww yeah  matt onto the side coughing had me a little bit of spittle on that one coughing pardon me  moving around the side the figure finishes and throws it and glances over and looks at your  group starts looking somewhat curiously /town/ as you pass  sam and laura hissing  matt make a deception check jester  laura and travis why  laura because i rolled a shitty stealth thats why oh no  matt yashas going to make a deception check as well  laura gasp natural 20  matt all right yasha rolled pretty high on that actually the figure goes back to its work and  begins carving it you move past that into the first street walkway it moves on for about  fifteen or so feet and then it has a crosspath it goes to the /town/ right and the left and ahead it goes  to another set of buildings behind and there is an alley that turns to the right and it seems to  end at that point so you have a t intersection before you and then it ends and curves to the  right where do you go  liam so an intersection to go through to get to the right turn past it  marisha i see so its like a crosst intersection  matt right you keep moving and then theres a right and left or you keep moving and /town/ then it  turns to the right  travis are there any windows doors anything on these buildings  matt you see open squares theres no glass panes but there are carved rectangles removed  travis can we move up to the side of one and glance in as we slow down just a little bit to  peek through  marisha on this t intersection  travis no before we get to the intersection  laura just to be clear i always thought that a t intersection was an intersection like this  matt travis and marisha fourway stop /none/  matt thats my fault its a lowercase t lowercase t  laura no no no i get it i just wanted to make sure  matt sorry i meant a cross intersection  liam dont you listen to her  matt no its fine its an important clarification thats my brain fart man i  appreciate the backup but yeah youre right on that  laura okay  marisha okay guru liam yeah liam from ojai  matt namaste  liam im going to go listen to your tapes your level seven tapes  taliesin a most expeditious movement /none/ towards the temple i suppose would be the  travis do we look in the window  matt as hes saying this you glance to the window to your left and as you look in make a  perception check  laura ooh  travis ugh seven  matt you glance inside and its a simple interior theres a little bit of sunlight coming  through from the opposite side of it from the direction of the light in the sky it frames  ambiently the outside of a figure that appears to be humanoid that is sitting over a /town/ table and you  can hear some grinding or carving sound but its faced away from you looks to be some sort of workshop  travis keep going  sam yeah  travis all right well push through  matt you push towards the first intersection  marisha can i see the tower the temple at all above the buildings  matt

season as that comes to you you glance  up to the side and you guys watch as two figures round the corner theyre both mostly human in  body though their bodies are scaled and a dull greengray color their heads fully serpentine  snake jaws the hoods not open but retracted and they both have strapped across their  shoulders and torsos longbows that are at rest and they have quivers filled with arrows they  walk /none/ past and glance over at the rest of your crew make a deception check jester  sam and laura hissing  laura big money okay okay 22  matt yasha as well the disguise didnt quite

travis do we seen anyone else around besides those two  matt right now make a perception check  travis oh 20  matt glancing about at this moment /none/ the only other figure you can see near this intersection is  one of the patrolling hunched creatures you saw up on the temple itself on the second tier and  its currently walking away from you and doesnt seem to be paying attention  laura grab them  liam yeah actually we should chase them and kill them because they could actually snap out of  it at any second  sam we should kill them  travis and liam kill them  laura grab them slit their throats  travis theyre large beings right  sam laura and /town/ marisha pull them off the street  sam okay yasha  matt hold on while you guys are deciding on this every turn they get to make a save

 marisha you said one saved  matt one saved  laura but we were putting things into their mouths  matt you were tying them up and gasping begins to but well get to that in /none/ just a minute  travis 29  matt you carve through him these are more ranged hunters theyre not as hardy as some of the other  ones out there and this one you manage to in just two quick swings carve through the chest and  take down most of the throat just tears open it crumples to the ground dead the other who is  currently being bound snarling begins to start making noise and getting ready to  liam are we in a stone room  matt youre inside a stone room  liam is there wood /none/  matt theres not much in the way of wood its mostly stone in here  liam fire bolt  travis and laura no  matt fire bolt or fireball  liam

you watch as he grunting freezes up from the stun and then gasping takes a bolt to  the throat the eyes begin to roll back as a fire bolt blasts in its chest and you /none/ watch as it  burns the edges of its face up in cinders it goes quiet before limping to the ground the smoke  coming up from its smoldering corpse  travis out  laura cover him up  matt at this point the rags in the corner begin to shift as you watch what appears to be an  individual sleeping in the corner begins to come to and it raspy breathing  marisha god go  matt look up and you can see what looks to be a more humanoid one of the most humanoid of the  /none/ ones ones youve seen there but with the scales what you managed to make yourself look like  begins to come to consciousness and goes snarling  laura oh shit  marisha does he see us  matt yeah you woke him the middle of his sleep  laura charm person  sam jesus  matt that is 15 it succeeds  marisha youre supposed to be better at this  laura somebody do fucking something because he shook it off  matt snarling  marisha throat punch  matt go for it the words you hear are who are /none/ you help as the shout is beginning to come out  but you go ahead and  marisha uhhuh 15  matt yeah 15 that hits  marisha stun  matt thats a failure yeah  marisha uhhuh hes stunned  matt stuns in the bed  taliesin sigh sacred flame  matt all right this individual doesnt have a lot of hit points so lets say for the sake of  brevity here being stunned you guys quickly yep however it did have the opportunity to shout  out one phrase well see if the guard heard it  /none/ sam oh boy  travis you know whatd be great right now a distraction maybe fire  matt its a natural 15  sam set fire to the house  liam its all stone  travis it is all stone theres no wood theres no nothing  matt inside this chamber its all stone therere stone tablets that have been carved and  then placed up against each other theres occasional scenes you can see through and the  ceiling above appears to be slats of stone that have been placed in a lattice formation  marisha i pull out /none/ all of the cherry bombs that i have and i go fucking fireworks  laura but wait maybe nobody heard  travis lets just get out  sam is there any hole in the ceiling or anything is there a roof  travis ceiling stone too  matt the ceiling looking up there is no second floor or anything and it looks like its just a  continuation of stone it looks like a series of thin slats have been placed one next to the other  in a layering to create a ceiling  taliesin back door  matt /none/ no this entrance is the only way in and out theres a window  travis out  taliesin im going to quickly grab two arrows from one of the dead lizards and stick them in his  chest and im going to walk out i want to go yeah  sam it was a suicide  laura maybe they all fought each other  matt you guys turn the corner and as you exit you can see that large looming slithering snake  figure with the huge scimitar thats probably 15 foot from tip of tail to nose thick burly /town/ body  slithering its way towards you  sam like can see us  marisha yeah what do you mean towards us  matt meaning whatever noise this figure managed i rolled high on its perception to  pick up the sound of its call and its making its way in your direction  travis okay i will point down the street away from us and go hissing and cast major image and  i will summon the image of a manticore a large manticore roaring and thrashing in the streets  laura oh thats tight  matt all right /none/ full sound and everything because major image you can do the full spread  travis the whole shebang make sound it smells the whole thing  matt so now suddenly in the middle of this room all of you turn and look and see as a  fullgrown manticore akin to the one that you battled not that long ago beneath the mines near  alfield you see wings unfurl roaring all of a sudden all eyes in the city shift to this  creature in a matter of moments you can see arrows being loosed in its direction hitting /none/ the  ground near it the snake that was approaching you spins around begins to draw its scimitar snarl  and it begins to approach  travis shouting go  sam on us or on the  travis and matt manticore  sam great lets run  laura we run away  matt you put that behind where the serpent was  travis yes so he has to turn and move away from us  matt okay you guys arc in the completely opposite direction heading towards where the base  of this temple is there is another one of /none/ those that is currently at the bottom of the stairway  that is making its way in your direction  laura i point at the manticore  matt you point at the manticore  travis i cant i point at the manticore no you did it  matt shes the one who did it  laura hey man i look like a snake person  matt make a deception check  sam this is going to be great  matt the dcs low on these because youre disguised  taliesin hey  laura nine  marisha oh shit  sam /none/ just had to beat a ten  matt you had to beat a ten you push and it turns around and sees the manticore and looks at  you curiously it has to take a moment to decide which is more dangerous the manticore or this  curious serpent goes ahead and grabs you by the chest and begins dragging you with it  taliesin it makes a grab for her  matt yeah it cant choose so it just grabs you  taliesin blindness im going to blind him before he grabs her  matt okay well first it /none/ has to try and grapple you so go ahead if you want to fight it  laura okay yeah ill try to back away  matt all right so acrobatics check natural two so make an acrobatics or athletics check to try  and break it  laura cool one  matt yeah it grabs you however whats the dc on the spell  taliesin constitution 16  matt natural two again it was like 20 two all of a sudden it loses sight and you see its eyes  starting to blink out where once the piercing yellow snake /none/ eyes fade to a snowblind white  snarling and hissing pulls its blade out and looks around looking freaked out at the process  you have to break that grapple its still holding you  laura oh i  matt make another athletics or acrobatics check whatre you making  sam jesus oh nope do another  laura that was a very aggressive roll athletics or acrobatics  matt yep your choice  laura acrobatics  matt all right  taliesin ah god  laura my dear lord fucking seven but he still rolled a natural two right no  /none/ matt well no that was the last time he rolled a natural eight so hes still holding onto you  hes blind but hes holding on to you the scimitars out and hes swinging it wildly at  whatevers in the area now that it cant see and is gnashing  travis can i take the sword and take a shot right at his wrist thats holding her with the hand  thats holding onto jester  matt sure its going to be at a major penalty  travis okay  matt so go ahead and roll  travis 17 /none/  matt 17 okay go ahead and roll damage  travis okay  sam oh boy this is going terribly  travis its going great were doing good oh thats good thats a 14  matt okay ill say thatll give you advantage on your next check  laura okay  matt it doesnt break the hold  sam i will step forward and say to the beast how does the lucidian ocean say goodbye it just  waves and ill cast tashas hideous laughter on it  matt okay natural four  cheering  matt falls to the ground /none/ and begins chuckling though in the middle of this chaos it is now  blinded and laughing it releases you  laura okay good  matt the manticore is still roaring creatures are now flooding out of the city to combat this  and you can see some of them are swinging and are beginning to notice something strange  laura ooh run away  marisha run run run  matt all right so you guys are charging towards the temple you bypass that one now youre  heading up the stairs up across the way theres one of those /none/ crotchety snake people that you saw  patrolling the upper area who has its longbow out and is currently firing one after another arrow  toward the manticore its moved off to the side it doesnt seem to immediately notice your  presence as you approach if you guys are trying to stealth by without getting its attention i  need you all to make another stealth check now that youve engaged in combat  laura add ten  sam youll need it  matt well hold on pass without a trace is it concentration  laura yes  matt /none/ because you cast hold person since then  laura oh hold person is a youre right  sam spell management  laura sorry i didnt realize hold person was a concentration  matt its okay it is so straight stealth checks guys  travis yep 13  marisha 22  liam seven  sam roll for yasha 20  laura 12  taliesin 17  travis i have yashas character sheet and she rolled a ten  matt okay hold on  taliesin i mean  marisha it was super down the middle  liam every week were like this /none/ is the episode where we start thinking this is the one  matt there we go  taliesin singing and whistling somethings out there  matt natural 20 on his end  all aww  marisha what do you mean  matt i rolled a natural 20 on my d20  marisha no i know what you mean  matt arrows whizzing gnashing  travis how far is this person  matt about 15 feet above you above the stairs just in the middle of the open glancing off to  the side the manticore still drawing most of the /dung/ attention but people are starting to figure out  the weirdness about it  travis can i use my bonus action to misty step up behind them and i will kick them down the stairs  towards the rest of us  sam ooh  marisha and taliesin yes  matt yes you can  marisha oh my god yes  matt in a whisp of dark shadow energy you see fjord just vanishes from sight and teleports right  behind go ahead and make an athletics check  travis oh god those used to be really great for me /none/ 17  matt natural four you sparta this fucker right off the side of the temple you watch him tumbling  down the entire length of the side of this temple before landing on the ground and skidding and  looking unconscious and bleeding out of the side of his mouth at the base of the temple  liam fire bolt  matt okay  sam on the dead guy  liam yeah is he dead or is he unconscious  matt hes unconscious  liam oh yeah thats a 22  matt technically hes prone because hes on the /none/ ground so it would be at disadvantage roll one  more time  liam its a 23  matt that hits roll damage so with the damage he took from the fall there oh yeah  travis oh thats not me jesus i was looking at yashas and it was like when did i get necrotic shroud  liam its five  sam exaggerated arnold schwarzenegger accent five points of damage  liam thats the sound it makes phoomph  matt so hes burning and not moving you assume  laura hes even more unconscious now  travis lets get /none/ the fuck out of here  laura keep going  sam is there an entrance to this tower  matt oh youre going stairs up the side it levels off towards the top of it but you dont  know whats at the top there  marisha is there anyone following us  matt make a perception check  sam many people  taliesin everybody  marisha okay 15  matt glancing around i mean the manticores causing a huge ruckus in the middle of the city  and those that have begun to realize that its an illusion are /none/ looking around confusedly and at the  moment do not see you but that time is going to be very short because youre out in the middle of  the sunlight the trees arent above you now this is an open clearing in the middle of the jungle  and youre just running up the side of these temple stairs with the light down upon you from the sky  liam how tall is this person whos just died  matt maybe from foot to shoulder  liam yeah  matt about four foot  liam hes only four feet /none/  matt yeah its like a tiny hunched  liam okay i take out some iron and i go whooshing and he shrinks to an eighth of that  and i pick him up  matt wait the one you just shot  liam yeah i dont want to leave him here  matt hes at the bottom of the temple  liam oh he went down there i thought he was at our feet  matt no you guys have been climbing the temple and he kicked him down off the side of it its all good  liam /none/ i would only do it if he was right where we were  matt right no worries  laura lets just keep running  travis yeah in out of light out of the way  matt okay so as that idea flashes through your mind that would be cool but its not going to  work so you keep rushing and we come back to the moment as you guys dart up the side of the temple  everyone make one more stealth check now that youve had that brief encounter and teleported  behind to make sure that nobody /none/ catches you before you reach the top portion  marisha stealth you said  matt stealth yes  marisha oh god  travis 12 for me natural 18 for yasha  marisha 12  liam 11  sam 20  laura 19  taliesin 17  matt thats still a pretty high average and its more of an average thing so a couple of stumbles  coming up the stairs from some of you but largely you make it cresting to the top of the platform  you get there for a second take a few breaths and realize glancing /town/ over to the side that people are  still emerging looking over the side and you can see dozens of these snake people are emerging from  the buildings and heading towards the sound of this raging manticore there are those that are  now scattering from the manticore trying to engage them to tell them its not what they think  it is there are eyes glancing around and you can see the sentinels are starting to but you guys  are keeping low and out of sight no one at the moment seems to notice where you are /none/ and the few  that have noticed you youve either taken out or have lost sight of where you were traveling so  for the moment you feel safe at the top of the temple you can see some sort of a worship  terrace theres torchbearing statues of snakes sitting near the corners of each of these five  sides of the temple similar in shape to the one that you found the idol in fact at the top of  each of these torches theres a similar golden idol but while the one you have is smooth each /none/  of these has a carved divot on the inside where the torch itself is actually burned in or where  materials are placed in to burn as a torch when the night comes or for any ceremonial use it requires  travis the top is open air  matt right now its just an open platform you do see in the center of it a heavy stone tablet  about 12foot by sixfoot the rests directly in the center you can see metal rings that are  bolted in with metal rivets that hold it on the sides of /none/ the tablet the stone itself appears to  be stained with a variety of various shades of stain  sam like blood  taliesin oak mahogany rosewood  taliesin and matt so much stain  laura where are we supposed to go  travis yeah we head towards the tablet  marisha so wait you said that there are tablets with rings on the corners of the tablet and splatter  matt there was one stone table about 12foot by sixfoot and on the sides of it there are rings  that are bolted in and there are stains across /none/ the surface  travis of the crimson variety  matt yep  marisha yeah super sacrificey  liam obviously for killing with all the reading i have done can i ascertain or have a good guess  of what this is used for besides  matt yeah you have a good idea  liam yeah i know its for killing people but does it do something to do something summon  things make a god happy  taliesin does it look like a trap door to me  liam i have read many books  matt well make an arcana /none/ check and make a religion check  taliesin all right  liam i got a one  matt okay youre not entirely certain  taliesin i got a 12  liam not my neighborhood  matt you get the sense that this is for sacrifices but youre not entirely certain to  what ends and to what purpose whether its just ceremonial or for a specific purpose  taliesin okay and it doesnt look like it moves  sam were still out in the open  matt youre out in the open on the top of this temple but you /none/ do see as youre inspecting the  table and looking around there is a trap door made of the same color stone that has a handle  built on it that you can pull back  sam should i check for traps  liam yeah is it safe  sam for sure ill check for traps 18 investigation  matt all right it looks to not be trapped though it is locked  sam all right ill unlock it thats 28  matt 28 getting down to this device you can see its an intricate thick long key what would /none/  have probably been that long and have a whole series of intricately designed cliffs to it to hit  all of the various  sam tumblers  matt tumblers thank you to get this to open however you manage to get multiple angles and  press and hold and press and hold with all of your tools it takes everything in your bag to get  through it but you manage to just hit each one properly and lift and it pulls open with a  grinding sound  laura shut up nott that was very good  sam /none/ that was not supposed to work  laura that was really good  sam that was luck that was dumb luck  taliesin lets get in were all going to get in come on  matt you do hear a smattering of hissing and growling sounds that are getting louder and louder  laura get inside of it mumbling can you relock the door or something  sam probably not but i can try  laura okay well just shut it and hope they dont notice that we came up here lets go  matt okay you all dart inside /none/ at this point as you are stepping inside you see on the opposite  end rushing up the edge you see jamedi go huffing very good and he jumps inside with  the rest of you  marisha wheres avantika  matt i have not seen her  marisha bullshit  matt i havent  marisha are you lying  matt make an insight check  taliesin ill join this one as well  marisha god fucking bull fucking shit  taliesin 25  marisha nine  matt hard to

inside the rest of you guys are inside you close it  laura yes  travis yes we close it yeah  taliesin im /none/ closing slowly  matt all right as you are just closing it gently you can see shapes coming up over one and  now a second side of the temple there are a few charging up all right it locks from the inside  the latch locks behind itself  sam i locked it  travis we may not have much time darkvision what do we see  marisha goggles  matt youre now standing in a small fivefoot by eightfoot chamber you are all cramped in there  but there is a spiral staircase that leads down  travis /none/ time to go  sam one at a time  travis you first  sam why me  travis check for traps  laura whoever im standing next to i grab their butt  taliesin whos rubbing my elbow its weird  sam ill take a big swig of liquor and start going down scanning for traps  matt okay make an investigation check  laura avantika avantika are you here  sam oh thats shit i only rolled an 11  matt all right there is a faint noise you hear that goes do not worry i was waiting /none/ for you up  top this entire time  liam im casting mage armor  matt all right mage armor is on whatd you roll  sam 11 for investigation  matt seems safe  sam coast is clear lets go running  matt okay notts charging down the stairs the rest of you follow suit the chamber beneath has  some sort of faint fiery light source and it opens up below you as you begin to move downward  you can see a pentagramlike chamber not a perfect pentagram but there are five sides to it  one /none/ thats shorter than the rest that gives this diamondshape to the interior of the chamber  there are two walls on the sides and there are bits of green growth in the corners in the  center theres a raised platform with some sort of fountain that rests in the middle and there  are four figures standing around this fountain which is precisely what you notice as nott your  foot hits one of these steps that clicks gives out from underneath and the stairs suddenly shift  into a sliding platform  sam weee  liam how steep /none/  matt its about a 45degree angle  liam so how fast does the fall feel  matt its only about ten feet 15 feet down and what would have stopped you to catch a moment you  all of a sudden slipping  liam so its not that far down  matt its not going to be a hard fall but any sense of stealth you wouldve had or any sort of  surprise is gone as all of you manage to barely glide your way to the bottom or stumble on your  ass sliding to the bottom /none/ of this chamber there in the darkened lit interior chamber three of  these figures standing around this fountain holding bowls glance over their shoulders towards  you and hiss with sharpened snake teeth  laura oh good this is the bowl drinking party we were looking for it oof  matt behind the fountain you see one jet blackgray humanoid body its a little larger  than the others with a giant extended snake head the cobra hood long and wide on each side its  eyes glowing red from the back  liam i begin casting slow  /none/ matt and well get to that next week  shrieks of disappointment  marisha oh my god  travis oh shit the big black cobra hood arms or just the serpentine body  matt its a slender humanoid body thats tall and thin but its body is gray scaled and armor plates  and then from its shoulders it extends up into the hooded cobra head  travis taller than the other three that were in the chamber  matt yeah its probably about sevenfoot tall and the others are about fiveandahalf sixfoot tall  liam lets skip and go /none/ to the next episode  matt we got a week  travis dont we have that little box that appears thats just counting down from ten nine eight  and its going to automatically skip to the fight right now right we can just
