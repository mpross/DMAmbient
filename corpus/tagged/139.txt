and it looked pretty intense  liam came together real good real good should definitely try it its on project alpha now  taliesin yeah theres a little trailer on youtube that went up /none/ today if you want to get a  glimpse if you want to get an idea of what the thing looks like the preview episode of the first  season is available on twitch you can find that and see if you like the idea of people using a  giant wooden tower to play a game its pretty cool  liam oh it was nervewracking and its halloween so its timely  laura its hot in here so my cake is melting  sam can we eat it  laura yeah we can totally eat it at the break /none/  taliesin next week im not running another vampire game because this is stressful and i need  to take a vacation lets be honest its because this is stressful and i need to take a vacation  boy am i really looking forward to being on the other side of this piece of wood  liam why do you think the mercers went around the planet  taliesin man i would escape to another continent myself  sam i think you mean the rays  liam theyre kicking it in australia right now having a blast  travis new /none/ one of these next week  sam yeah what are we doing next week are we announcing that oneshot  taliesin i choose you pikachu  travis yeah im doing a oneshot  sam travis willingham oneshot  travis or rather grog is running a oneshot  sam that is a highconcept piece  travis grogs gamenight comes next week where we will all play bunions and flagons  sam that could be a disaster  liam big math night  travis lots of algebra trigonometry  laura so were playing as our characters playing a game  travis yep /none/ a game within a game if you dare  laura so all we have to do is outsmart grog  travis pretty much but he is the game master so nothing to worry about everyones totally  safe and fine and youre alive by the way  liam not even thinking about it im just taken by how handsome you look tonight  travis oh good thanks i killed a bunch of clickers to get here there were some cannibals  but the fireflies are on my six so we should get started  taliesin you should not wear makeup /none/ more often i think it really brings out your you have a  natural glow to yourself right now  liam dont worry about going gray because its working  travis it makes me look far wiser than i actually am i can reverse math all day  taliesin so to keep things moving because apparently i should do that even though im really  enjoying this theres no talks machina this tuesday because its halloween instead of talks  machina youre going to enjoy eric campbells cthulhu oneshot on the 7001000 time our  wednesday club this week is /none/ going to be japanese influence on american comics with erika ishii  which should be fun tomorrow we are doing our first little halloween fun with gather your treats  on gather your party youre going to see my real halloween costume which is not on theme with this  episode oh its fancy as fuck its bad  liam i feel

end of announcements  liam oh nope theres one last little thing starting next week were going to be doing a  last final round of vox machina character playlists whoa not everybodys ready mine is

things lets make sure  that i have this right 100230pm eastern standard time is the critical role panel and then  the signing will be 530730 eastern standard time pax unplugged on friday info should be on  the website if it changes stay tuned if youre in that area come out throw things at them  because we wont be /none/ there  taliesin encouraging all sorts of bad behavior well see if you live through the night thatll  be cool i think its time for us to take a moment and prepare ourselves so i can get a bit of my  aggravation and pentup frustration out on you as we start to pick up tonights episode of thursday  by midnight part two and again thank you to white wolf and to onyx for everything theyve done and  ill talk a little bit about that during the game thank you guys so much and lets roll the /none/ game  dramatic music  taliesin that delighted me that didnt really throw me it was just pleasing when we last left  the game thats weird to say we had just dove underneath the wednesday club table into a  mysterious hole in the back of the studio just in time to see fire and air pressure push everything  bedlam and sounds and screams and fire above us and thankfully you had gotten to cover underneath  the table and whatevers going on up there theres still terrible commotion you can hear things  falling you can hear /none/ things breaking and shredding and the fires are obviously spreading  you can feel the heat pushing through the table but thankfully there seems to be some sort of  break in the floor  laura i found it  taliesin you did find it  sam good job vampire laura  taliesin and this perhaps is how somebody got access to this building i dont know right now  youve got about ten feet of clearance on the little cap thats keeping the fire at bay a  couple of you are still a little hungry  laura just /none/ a little hungry  sam im not hungry  laura youre sup oh oh  taliesin youre fine at the moment  sam yeah  laura maybe you guys should i sneak ahead should i obfuscate ahead  travis obfuscate i dont think you used that term correctly  laura obfuscate  travis that means you vanish but youve got to hold still right  laura no  sam can we talk for a second about who was that up there gary gygax  travis yeah and to our rescue came matthew colville  sam matthew colville  was he /none/ undead or was he just a man  liam i think he was a vamp  laura and sam was he  taliesin he may have been a vamp or maybe he was just a really good guy you dont know  travis did he have claws  taliesin he did have claws briefly there was some slight claw you would have noticed that  liam and gary gygax beloved for inventing our cherished game im a snaggle tooth now  laura you just took one out  liam i just took one out sure for now ill change it /none/ itll be different teeth at different  times sometimes there will be none sometimes there will be both lets make it none and gygax  had very long protruding fingers like obscenely long fingers right  laura does that mean hes like an old vampire like hes been a vampire a really long time  liam i dont know i talk into a can for a living i dont know  sam you liam obrien know all sorts of stuff about vampires i sam riegel do not  liam i saw the lost boys that doesnt tell me anything about /none/ vampires its in the movies  sam i didnt even see interview with a vampire  laura it was so good  sam was it  laura yeah  liam guys we are going to die or undie or something can we focus in on what are we going to  do danis dead  laura we dont know that theyre all dead we just know the twitch studio has exploded for all we  know the rest of legendary is still there  sam well were not going back there now it blew up  laura fuck no  /none/ travis is the tunnel backup blocked by debris and other  taliesin to go back up  travis mmhmm  taliesin you cant tell but youre welcome to find out  travis well jesus taliesin  liam does my iphone have any service  taliesin if you recall you got buried without your iphones last time  travis oh thats right we didnt have our phones in the first place so that thing on your wrist is  taliesin youre going to have to read a book like somebody from the olden days now  travis being that i have /none/ heightened senses what can i see in our new under the earth situation  taliesin just because i feel like being a bit of a jerk if youre going to use your heightened  senses just burn a hunger  travis okay  taliesin actually give me a hunger roll im going to do something different just roll a d10  tell me what you get  travis just a red d10  taliesin yeah just a red d10  travis six  taliesin all right youre fine  travis a six and above is a success right  laura /none/ i have to remember yeah i have to remember what is  taliesin six and above is a success and then youll always have to roll your red dice you can  lose them and gain them  liam this is a really characterheavy question does anyone have an extra pencil  travis yep  liam no  laura no dont throw things  taliesin this tunnel that youre in from what you can see somebody burrowed somehow some creature  made this and its just big enough for like about two people and it goes down into a larger /none/ tunnel  directly below you its like a little offset  laura do we hear any sounds coming from the tunnel  taliesin do you hear sounds coming from the ipad let me find out  travis do we see any slime or hair or anything thats like oh this is a  taliesin you can hear the faint distant sound of a little bit of water a little moisture  and its a big tunnel so down there it could be anything theres definitely some sound down there  sam we cant go back up it exploded  laura /none/ no our only choice is to travel underground  liam you should probably do that obfuscate thing that youve talked about  laura i want to  travis or or we can do the thing that weve learned from being vox machina for so long whos  super fast like the flash  sam i am  travis yeah you should run ahead dart ahead of all of the rest of us and check it out  sam but i unlike vax from vox machina dont have darkvision do we have anything that glows  laura we can see  /none/ taliesin you can see okay you cant see as well as he can  sam all right  liam is above sealed help me visualize whats above us  taliesin so above you youre down in a little bit of a tunnel and its at a bit of an angle and  the basically giant circular manhole that is that table has stamped down and seems to be pressured  down at the moment  liam so were not getting any firelight or anything  taliesin no youre feeling some heat but youre not getting any firelight  liam im /none/ not seeing anything  taliesin he can kind of see something and theres a little light coming from the bottom of  the tunnel theres just enough to make out some  travis theres just enough light coming from the bottom of the tunnel  taliesin just at the very bottom theres enough  liam definitely sam or laura or travis should go ahead  travis i think thats a good idea  laura i think thats a really good idea liam you should stay here and be safe  travis good call yeah im glad we agree  liam /none/ let the brain hang back and figure shit out right  travis i will kill him first  sam do you want me to go down there  laura do it go so fast  sam im going to go so fast and dart ahead like 40 feet  taliesin youre going to go so fast like pacman  sam yeah  taliesin all right  laura or i could sneak down because people cant see me if i do it well  travis yeah either one of two  sam maybe we should do that  travis yeah do /none/ that  laura okay im going to do that hes not going to go fast im going to sneak in  taliesin you have to do a roll dont you or do you just have to  laura ill go caw caw  taliesin oh no you dont youre fine roll a d10 tell me what you get  laura the red  taliesin yeah  laura two  taliesin you get one point of hunger youre fine youre going to do it but here have a  laura i get hungrier but i can do it  taliesin you /none/ get a little hungrier  laura okay  taliesin but yeah so you sneak down and the tunnel is larger than youd expect its 12 feet  in diameter  laura okay i got hungrier so ive got to put my fangs back in you guys  sam sure  taliesin its a carved out tunnel but not a technically carved tunnel theres like some  animals that burrowed this big hole but  did it very well something made this with some  skill but its not modern theres something weirdly ancient and a little unsettling about the  /none/ whole tunnel its not a sewer you were expecting a sewer its not there  laura does it feel stable  taliesin it looks very stable and it looks like its been there a long time  laura what does it smell like  taliesin it smells slightly sour like the algae that is growing on the walls this white  crystalline algae that gives off a very gentle glow  laura oh so i can see  taliesin just a hint  laura im going to lick the algae  sam oh god last time someone licked something tasted /none/ something  taliesin youre going to lick the algae  laura just like a little lick  taliesin a little lick the algae  laura not like a big big lick  sam that looks so gross with the teeth the tongue with the ugh  taliesin im going to say it tastes like algae  laura hmm not like rat droppings  taliesin no i mean it tastes awful it tastes of putrescense and death and awful this shit is  disgusting  travis well we know youre fans of rats but  laura i know i am  /none/ sam hows it look down there laura  laura shut up i keep going forward  liam shes got this  taliesin the tunnel goes down  laura it keeps going  taliesin the tunnel keeps going you cant see the end of it  laura oh okay wait i go back to them follow behind me but not right behind me  travis how far behind you  laura just you know whatever like 50 feet behind me is that far  taliesin oh man  liam thats like here to the door out to the  laura yeah /none/ and then unless i make noise like a scream or something then you know its safe you  can keep coming forward  liam i mean youre not really human anymore youre kind of tough now  laura yeah im so tough  travis we will follow not so closely behind  sam liam and laura yep  liam ill be 51 feet behind  laura and i go back to where i was and keep walking  liam yessir  laura holy shit its like catacombs is this serious  taliesin this is so serious  laura this is /none/ serious  sam guys i took off my shoes and ive got to say it feels so much better  laura yeah  liam not doing a good job of quelling the serial killer thing sam  laura you are really creepy looking  sam its the eyebrows well i put on this part and i was like it needs something else  taliesin its genuinely distracting  travis you look like if the clown from spawn was trying to be pacman pac mcfarlane pacman  taliesin youre probably not going to really run into anything for about a quarter /none/ of a mile in  going down and eventually after about a quarter mile you can see a place where the modern  sewer system has cut through this tunnel like someone hit this and decided to keep going and so  theres a sewer system thats obviously city sewer although very old coming out at an angle hits  this tunnel ignores it and continues in an odd way and this tunnel also keeps going around the  corner so you can  laura i can choose  taliesin theres some options  laura okay guys it intersects with /none/ the sewer theres got to be so many rats in the sewer  sam oh yeah you could have a feast  laura heres the thing  sam i dont eat rats  liam she doesnt either you dont eat rats  travis you just eat people now  laura yall rats are super good  liam what do you mean  laura theyre like so fucking good  travis sofa king  liam sofa king  laura sofa king delicious but heres the thing this tunnel intersects with the sewer we can  either continue through this tunnel and /none/ try to figure out i dont know why were  vampires and see if theres some source to this power or we go to the sewer and we live  travis live there  sam you mean live forever in the sewers  laura yeah we can hide out in the sewers under la  sam what if we need  taliesin im so into this plan  travis what happened to you in that coffin were talking about you  sam dont you want to solve this theres got to be a cure right  laura look wait were /none/ fucked were vampires  liam we can but yeah let me pitch something here like were all tired we have day jobs  sam are we  liam i am  sam taliesin are we tired  liam thats not what im talking about i mean in general  taliesin liams tired  liam we got day jobs we got night jobs we work a lot we could be princes and queens of death now  sam whos thinking princes and queens of death we almost were killed by werewolves and bigger  vampires  laura theres probably other things /none/ that are scary  sam wed be the lowest i dont know anything about vampires but we could be private first  class vampires  travis wait didnt a week go by  liam husbo you are two hours into being a vampire if that you just learned how to run who  knows what else youre going to learn  laura true  sam i also learned that i could kill a man in seconds flat  liam thats hot  travis wait raise your hand if youve killed somebody a person  taliesin oh wait sorry carry on /none/  sam i killed a person i dont know what came over me it was amazing  liam did i kill that guy did i kill max when i ate him  travis yeah wait no  sam i killed max  travis oh you left him for dead okay im just checking to make sure like  taliesin i think sams the only one whos actually  travis might be holding onto this for no good reason  laura technically i did too but its not important  liam who was it  laura its just a chick  /none/ sam wait who did you kill  laura its just this chick up in the smart girls  sam did you know who she was  laura no i didnt know her remember we were there fucking together  sam oh that girl yeah and i guess i probably caused that other boy to die  liam thats the worst thing to say dressed like pacman  sam ive killed two people travis  taliesin you dress like that you also eat their ghosts so theyre like the soulless really sorry  laura look travis not all of us have /none/ willpower like you i get really hungry and if i dont eat  i get really angry  travis no thats the truth preach i know  liam and also im really shy and awkward right but as a vampire it can only get better right  sam so were just committing after an hour of being a vampire were saying you know what fuck  it lets be vampires forever  liam i mean i am  laura heres the thing we could record at night after a few days with these teeth i think ill  get used /none/ to talking with them  sam its going to really hurt your commercial auditions  laura i know but i dont do very many of them  sam really you have a good commercial voice  laura really you think so  sam yeah i think so young mom  laura thanks  sam sure  travis forever lets go see the sewer a little more closely i feel weird about this  laura about what  travis just committing to being i dont know if i want to stay this way  laura i mean we can go we /dung/ can keep looking we might die  travis i like the sun its warm  sam yeah sports are played there  travis yeah i mean there are night games but  laura thats true you cant swim at the beach and stuff  travis i mean you can its just super dark and swimming in the ocean at night is scary  liam there might be underground lakes in here  travis yeah  laura you know in one of the games i did where i was a vampire vampires are allergic to water  travis all water  /none/ laura yeah i dont know if thats true or not oh is there water in the sewer  taliesin theres a little bit of water in the sewer  laura im going to wind over and put my hand in it and let  taliesin thats disgusting and probably will give you pink eye youll eventually get to find out if  vampires get pink eye i dont know and thats a question for  laura did it hurt though  taliesin no it didnt hurt  laura okay then i dont think were allergic to water  liam okay /none/ so were not nazgul  jeez all kinds of things are changing now  sam his vampire powers are amazing he  clutched this very warm mug  laura so what do you think do you want to go to the tunnels some more  liam yeah weve got to progress our lives our unlives further so we cant stay here arguing  whatever were going to do  travis yeah weve got to go forward  liam i want to be a vampire  laura you want to stay a vampire  liam im fucking in  travis i /none/ have amazing senses i hear everything that youre saying  liam im not hiding this from you travis  travis then why are you directing it towards her shoulder  sam i just touched myself and you didnt know because im so fast that i  travis no i knew that too  taliesin you also didnt feel it because youre so fast  laura aw you didnt feel anything  taliesin no  sam just adjusted a little bit  travis just a tremor  liam im not hiding anything from you well bring you around  taliesin since /none/ you do have heightened senses you can hear some tiny bit of rattling around down one  of the sewer tunnels you can hear some tiny bit of rattling around further down  travis oh wait shh i actually hear something down this way  sam lets go  laura should we go to the path  travis yeah  sam are you on point  laura but dont forget this is where the tunnel continues on from where geek and sundry was  travis no were going this way  laura okay  travis well go towards that noise /none/  taliesin you head down its about 200 feet before you get to a sewer lock off where theres  an old power box and a small grate system that the water flows through but things do not there are  definitely some rats rolling around and theres a weird brick square chimney that goes off up into  god knows where and on the side of the wall is a small lock boxpower box with some very old  signage on it thats a little hard to read  liam ill give it a shot  travis can i /none/ snag one of the rats and fucking rip its head off and squeeze it like a thing of  toothpaste  taliesin give me a dex brawl  liam like an otter pop  laura gross  sam like a hichew  taliesin hichew  travis dex brawl all the dice three successes two failures but none of them are red  taliesin three successes two failures not two ones though  travis two ones but theyre black ones  taliesin theyre black ones three successes two black ones its hard to read the handwriting  its a little tricky /none/ oh no you were going for the rat  travis i was going for the rat yeah toothpaste rat  taliesin you did not grab the rat  travis damn it  taliesin the rat got away  travis fuck i should have eaten somebody im so hungry ive got all these red dice  liam lets read the handwriting  taliesin yeah give me a perception awareness  liam a perception and awareness thats not bad  taliesin no  liam thats not bad lets see  laura can i try to get a rat because im really good /none/ at it now

taliesin and one blood failure  liam yeah  taliesin its really hard to read somebody scratched this in it takes you a minute it does  say sanctuary  liam it says skanktuary  taliesin skanktuary with a little arrow facing the way you came and either a cross or /none/ a t or  something below it and the box has definitely been broken into there used to be a lock on the  box but the lock is broken what did you roll  laura i rolled two successes  taliesin oh yeah you got it give me a blood die back  laura yay can i try to catch one for travis  taliesin yes you can  laura is it dex brawl again

established now  laura never mind they wont come out im stuck like this  liam yes you are  travis forever  sam is there a way to continue on down the sewer path or thats it  taliesin theres some attempts you could /none/ make but the sewer path is definitely treacherous at  this point  sam all right lets turn around  laura lets go to the sanctuary  travis okay  sam if we follow the arrow where the sanctuary was pointing  taliesin further down that old tunnel  sam yeah  travis yeah lets do that  taliesin all right this tunnel goes on for a long time what would i call this if anyone

travis is there any pavers or anything in this tunnel or does it still look like it was burrowed  like rudimentilarily  taliesin since you had a decent perception its burrowed but theres some very specific scratch  marks since youve gotten a little further on there starts to be some rudimentary like almost a  hobo code is what i would call it theres little symbols that have been left that obviously /none/ mean  something but you dont know what they mean somebodys been in here  travis were making pretty good distance i think were close to mullholland  laura really  sam thats far  laura

little cloudy youre not all there  liam its good im going to leave it /none/ behind because ive got a new future now  sam whats our endgame here weve been walking for miles  travis well we cant go

lizard people beneath the  travis yes of course man the rest are in dc  taliesin goddamn it that is some deep la myth man okay  travis we want to let you go we dont mean you any direct harm but we need to know how to get  out of this tunnel  /none/ sam how long does the tunnel go where can we find an exit  laura how can we not be vampires anymore  travis were going to eat him i dont want to be a vampire were going to eat him  taliesin whats wrong with you people  sam were new at this youve been here for what a millennia or something weve been vampires for  i guess two weeks right  laura ish  taliesin i twice have been beneath cities since its inception for thousands of years we have  lived you are supposed to know /tavern/ this  laura we dont know anything  taliesin we had an arrangement with you  travis were literally hours into this thing we dont mean any offense  sam no one guided us through the change we had no bar mitzvah or whatever you call it  taliesin you people are way too pitiful to be vampires  travis okay hold it take it easy  sam we have powers all right look at this and i walk up around the tunnel like in a  loopdeloop  taliesin i can do that i dont really  sam yeah /none/ but im not a lizard  laura yeah but what about this  taliesin that doesnt work if were actually watching you you know that right  laura just kidding  taliesin its like you got fuzzy for a second  liam ive been listening in and i come in and say what about this and i use presence awe on him  taliesin are you going to try presence awe  liam sure am  taliesin im going to double check my  liam what do i roll charisma plus persuasion is all it says  taliesin so give /none/ me a roll of 1d10  liam all right well charisma plus persuasion  taliesin well first give me a hunger roll since im

smaller  laura before we release you pinky swear that youre going to help us  taliesin dont know if he has pinkies well yeah he could put something out put a claw  laura can i try to manipulate him or persuade him or something  taliesin you can do you want to do charisma or manipulation  liam taliesin did my glamor work  taliesin you dont know  liam dont know /none/ all right  laura im not as good at it as vex is  taliesin im going to give you charisma persuasion  travis watch where you point that thing  taliesin stamina  laura stamina  taliesin hashtag stanima they made us character sheets with stanima on them  laura three successes  taliesin i know this is weird but i swear weve met  laura you seem really familiar  taliesin you look very familiar  laura yeah do you ever go to jinkys  taliesin no  liam youre not nerdist i mostly know geek  sundry /none/  taliesin might have been smart girls to be fair to you youd never know if there were lizard people  working  laura i feel like we know him lets release him for sure  liam before we do were idiots right were brand new obviously theres been some sort of  peace between above and below and we just want to facilitate that right  taliesin that seems fair yes  sam hes been released i release him  taliesin come ill take you to the chamber  travis who will we be meeting  taliesin well that /none/ depends well see youre going to follow him further down  travis sure as were walking from behind can i use my aura perception to see what his true  motives are as hes leading us to this chamber  taliesin sure roll a blood die just one die  travis fuck  taliesin you rolled a one didnt you  travis yeah a red one  taliesin you get another hunger what are you at now  travis i was at three down from the four from my wife rat now im back up to four  taliesin is /none/ that a proper die did i give you one with an x it doesnt matter you know if you rolled  a one now you can roll your check for that that was to see if you get hungrier from using it  sam in real life or as a vampire  laura i know can we cut that cake  travis thats one blood one and three successes  taliesin one blood failure its going to take you a little while to figure it out but he seems  frustrated you get a frustrated vibe from his aura  /dung/ travis but not the im leading them into a trap  taliesin theres nothing duplicitous yet if anything youre getting a little activity up here  like hes wracking his brain trying to figure out what is going on he seems just as confounded by  this perhaps you go down a little further through this cave until you come into a huge  clearing that is that was amazing  travis i whip my hair back and forth  liam its hot in here so if you could keep doing that  taliesin at home if you want to /none/ simulate the studio right pump that heat up to about 100  degrees its great theres a big interior cavern that you seem to be under youre probably pretty  deep now were probably deeper than the subway tunnels probably just barely on the other side  or a little further past mulholland maybe a little deeper and you come into these two giant  stone lions that have started to decay and crumble and theres a big beautiful stone sign that is  decaying falling apart and covered with this strange luminescent moss and it says luna park  /none/ travis probably not the restaurant  laura oh yeah i was thinking of the restaurant  taliesin you were thinking of the restaurant how do you know the restaurant im so impressed  by you  laura we love that place its so good  taliesin as you come in you pass through these arches and theres this strange what can only be  described as a supervillains lair this is an abandoned theme park underground  laura what thats creepy  taliesin theres a lake in front of you with a beautiful boardwalk that has crumbled into  disrepair /none/ theres a strange pyramid volcano in the distance theres a strange little  amphitheatre to the left that looks like an ancient roman colosseum odd gardens with strange  luminous plants growing if you peek in the back you can see the beginning of cages perhaps for  animals  liam how big are we talking like an nfl stadium  taliesin slightly less than about half a stadium  sam do you know what the size and shape is liam  liam i was just in one  taliesin ill tell you what not that we dont have but /none/ if you want to see it you can get a  notion of it  laura damn this is big  taliesin its big  laura which direction did we enter from  taliesin from the bottom  laura the main entrance wow  taliesin i will at some point post that on the internet so that people can see  laura jeez louise thats big and intricate what is his name  taliesin lock  laura lock what is lock doing right now  taliesin he is guiding you past the lake to a strange  sam is this /none/ the old zoo  taliesin no  laura this is still underground  taliesin mmhmm ill tell you about this at the break and then ill tell you where that map came  from its fascinating this is my other hobby that im bringing into this game  sam collecting old lizard maps of la  travis see taliesins so immortal he remembers the civilizations that preceded  taliesin 5000 years ago 5000 years is how long lizard people have been in los angeles man no i  got shit as he brings you past the lake and he brings /none/ you past the amphitheatre and the strange  gardens with these strange luminous lilies and these orchids that are growing that never seen  sunlight you come to this weird old victorian house thats obviously a facade into a basic black  box like in an amusement park and above it it says the house of trouble  sam treble  taliesin the house of trouble  sam theres music in there  taliesin and he is turning up not of treble its not the house of treble the house of  trouble not treble  sam im pretty sure /none/ you said treble twice  taliesin well then youre going to be very disappointed when you go in and he gestures for  you to enter  laura are you going to come in with  us is it scary  sam no theres music its fine  liam are you not allowed in there lock  taliesin inside will be those who know what to do with the four of you  sam without a proper introduction how will we know who were talking to we really need you in  there with us  taliesin ill follow  /dung/ travis fair enough  sam who should go in first  travis ill go in  sam why  laura because hes big and strong  sam we choose leaders based on size it should be on intelligence  laura so travis goes first then  sam yes absolutely but not because hes strong  travis whats your intelligence rating three and mines four so yeah ill do that  laura but you know what mine is four as well  liam same  sam im the dumbest one thanks taliesin  liam taliesins brother  taliesin my brother thank /none/ you alex jaffe for making a judgment call there  sam out of those guys i think sams probably the dummy  taliesin you know maybe if you had gone to burning man he would have a better opinion of you  travis is this tibets doing  taliesin no its alex  travis oh its okay okay great  taliesin both of my brothers are now dipping their head in panic  travis laura and i will colead this venture into the chamber  laura liam you stay back you have to be safe  liam are you sure /none/ okay if you insist  travis yeah i think thats actually a good idea  liam only if you insist  travis yeah in fact just stay behind sam  liam my normal place  taliesin thats a smart place to be  sam duh that sounds good  taliesin youre not taking that three very well are you  sam going to the big house  taliesin really not taking that three well good to remember so sorry as i check my notes thank  you as you enter what appears to have once been perhaps some strange boat /dung/ ride some weird tunnel  of love ride where you have boats that go through some strange cave has been drained and you step  into the cavern and you walk into the back and as you curl around into the main amphitheater of the  ride it is blindingly plated with gold there is ancient beautiful almost a little bit of mayan  a little bit of north american hopi indian design decked through this room it is gleaming with a  gold glow from all of the plates that have been intricately set into this room from the /none/ throne  that has been set up in the center to the benches that have been placed around like a bit of an  observation court like a surgical observation youre sitting in a pit in a theater thank you  laura does it look like it was all done at the same time or has it been added over time  taliesin its all too old to tell its like walking into a temple its hard to tell what came  first and what didnt  liam how big is the house how many seats  taliesin about 50 /none/  laura so its like a surgical theater  taliesin its like a surgical theater youre going to be at the bottom and then there are rows  of people at the top and theres not a ton of people if you can call them people there  theres about 20 lizard men gathered around taking a look  liam specifically lizard men  taliesin you probably cant tell gender yet and i wouldnt even necessarily know how one would  tell gender off the top of my head  sam ive got some ideas  taliesin i knew you /none/ would there is obviously a leader lock is coming in from the back and is  joined by two or three others who are not pressuring you inside but definitely making  sure youre not about to run as you enter and stand in the center of the theater lock turns to  the lizard creature in the largest most ornate gold chair and turns and says my lord kotori  we found them in the tunnels but i dont think they are necessarily the ones that have been  causing our problems and kotori takes a moment looking over /none/ all four of you well explain  yourselves then what are you doing in our tunnels when we have a very fair agreement with  the vampires above that you mind your own business  liam i step forward and begin to talk using presence awe again which is charisma  taliesin roll your blood and then roll your charisma  liam so i roll a single blood die thats a two  taliesin you get one more hunger where are you at  liam im at four im real hungry lizard  taliesin what am i going to do /none/ with that hold on all right youre fine  laura oh thats good you got a critical success  taliesin one critical success  liam two  laura he got two tens on blood dice  taliesin two tens oh my god on blood dice that changes things okay thats good to know  liam we mean no disrespect or harm and are in awe of what you have built here we have wandered  down by accident due to calamity and we are children of the night in the purest sense and we  ask for patience and empathy /none/ for the unwise  sam theater training  taliesin so it worked definitely seems like hes looking at you with nodding respect another  gaunter lizard comes up to kotori on the side be careful of this one i think hes trying to  manipulate you and kotori sits and looks at you  liam ill go further we are in fear and awe of this council no fucking joke and all we want is  safe passage and understanding we dont mean to subvert or cause problems merely to survive  taliesin there are rules and protocols in place /none/ for these things and ignorance of the law is not  absolution from the law however you did not know and the fact that you did not know goes to show  theres something very wrong you should not exist and not know this somebody has made a mistake  laura things are kind of crazy out there  sam so if you could undo it and make us humans again i think well be on our way  liam he doesnt speak for all of us  taliesin i can make you lizards  sam that sounds amazing  /none/ liam and travis super cool  sam it would be really great but were still getting used to this though  liam might be too soon for a jump right away  taliesin laughing no i cant do that  laura aww you got us  taliesin but youre funny youre not as smart as the other ones are you  sam apparently not i mean we havent compared sat scores or anything but we will later tonight  liam sam this is like being john malkovich youre not the real john malkovich this is like a  pretend john /none/ malkovich john malkovich playing a pretend john malkovich well pretend you arent  super keen  sam sure  liam yeah you look like a serial killer  taliesin so disturbing its really hard to work through  travis my 1600 will hold up  sam 1600  taliesin well obviously the four of you are not our problem but the fact that youre down here is  our problem there have been vampires in our tunnels for three weeks  laura three weeks  taliesin there are rules there are protocols and obviously they have been ignored do you /none/ have  any notion of what has been going on do you perhaps have any kernel of thought as to the  nature of this why have people been in our tunnels  liam well im not going to fluff us up we dont know much but we did come in contact with some  sort of vampire lord  taliesin interesting  laura there was a giant meatball that seemed to be turning people into other things  sam yeah thats true there was also i mean some sort of void under the game table right that  could /none/ have plunged people down below  laura oh yeah there was a guy that we know that when we woke up all of a sudden he was a wizard  and he had electricity coming off of him  travis and are you familiar with one gary gygax  taliesin as hes about to speak from the back one of the other lizards goes ive heard of gary gygax  travis yes many of us have we were surprised to see him up and walking about a mere hour after we  woke and found ourselves in this state  /none/ taliesin this other lizard comes up and starts whispering in kotoris ear seems very excited  about something  laura do you play dd  sam he might be a critter  taliesin we have internet down here were not savages apparently members of our council are  aware of your show  sam theyre everywhere critters are everywhere  taliesin you are everywhere you are literally everywhere  travis did we grab any posters or fan art on our way out  liam they all burned up  taliesin things would have gone so much better if you had /none/  laura hey i have some merch we were going to sell in my pocket  liam the airport subways lizard colonies theres always one guy  laura do you want coasters ive got some strongjaw coasters  taliesin kotori is giving you an eye but the other guy is not making eye contact hes breaking  and making eye contact  liam is he as old as the rest  taliesin its hard to tell man whats the difference can you tell the difference between an  old iguana and a young iguana  laura sort of like the /none/ scales are less vibrant  taliesin they look pretty healthy  liam i mean how much is the iguana talking about iras and shit  laura heres the thing we just want to know whats going on with us we just want to know  whats going on we dont know anything is there something we can do to help you that will you  know we help you you help us help us figure out whats happening  travis is there any way to be of service we dont mean to offend  sam were good at catching rats /none/  laura yeah im really good at rat catching  travis hes really fast i can sense things  laura im sneaky  liam and also do you have any human prisoners down here or anything  taliesin sadly we do not  laura any other animals that you dont care about  taliesin sadly no the few animals we do have here have purposes in the menagerie but perhaps  we can come to an arrangement  travis were very interested in that  taliesin something has gone wrong we are going to have to reestablish some rules and /none/ youre  obviously someone elses problem  travis clearly  taliesin we will give you passage to the surface we will show you where you can come in  contact with some individuals who can clear things up  sam passage to the surface  laura thats good  taliesin we will send you to the people whose problem you are as opposed to ours and in return  you will deliver a message you will tell them that we are displeased and that we have to have  words and that they must find a way of becoming friends /none/ with us again we will need  laura a boon  taliesin a boon they will owe us for their transgression and you will deliver our message  laura we can do that  sam sure it doesnt seem like a great message to deliver to someone just saying like they might  be upset with us  taliesin oh they may kill you vampires are not known for their kindness  travis well we might change that  laura i mean were really nice pretty genuine  liam im a good talker these days these hours if i could /none/ maybe eat  travis were very interested in getting to the surface we will deliver your message as youve  described it  liam gratefully  sam but i feel like if its nighttime we should probably hurry because we cant be up there when  the sun comes up  laura no itll kill us i saw what happened to matt  liam no yeah  taliesin you wont have to be up there for very long lock mahlo take them to the pyramid show  them to los globos  laura how long have you been a lizard /none/ person lock have you always been a lizard person  taliesin yes of course  laura are you thousands of years old  taliesin no weve been here for thousands of years i am merely 250 300 at this point  travis infancy got it  laura cool just wondering  taliesin youll know what that feels like if youre lucky  liam whispering thats what im talking about travis  laura i mean we might not change back you guys  sam but what about our friends our family  travis yeah and fashion trends theyre such a bitch /none/ to keep up with  sam youre just going to give up everyone you know and love to be immortal sewer vampires  liam yeah sam yeah this feels great i mean im hungry but we get to spend time together for  fucking ever  sam i love hanging out with you but its not like we can podcast from down here  liam theyve got internet  taliesin we have actually really good broadband down here its insane  liam question have you heard allworknoplay any episodes  taliesin of course yeah ive listened to the whole thing /none/  liam youve got nothing youve got nothing  travis their router obviously runs through malaysia  sam ill think about it  laura lets go  travis were ready to go  taliesin good luck and lock see if you cant wrangle them up something to eat on the way up  there lock nods and starts leading you all along with mahlo whos definitely not quite  grinning im not entirely sure what you would call this weird curl at the side as they lead you  to the pyramid at the very back  liam is it /none/ one of these smiles  laura its one of those  taliesin its like an iguana smile  laura oh cute marlo  taliesin mahlo lock kotori are the three weve met so far mahlo and lock are taking you to the  pyramid  liam which leads to los globos  taliesin youll find out  sam does anyone speak spanish what does los globos mean  taliesin im so amused by all of this  sam the globos what does that mean  taliesin as you walk back across the lake past the notquiteabandoned zoo but slightly  /none/ abandoned there are definitely some creatures in there that look vaguely familiar  liam theyre not typical though  taliesin theres something a little off about all of them its as if somebody had grabbed a mountain  lion and bred them for a few centuries and saw what happened without sunlight so theyve all  started to lose their eyes and theyve all got the little bit of milky appendage eye everythings  gotten a little weird down here  laura creepy ooh very much like the descent  taliesin and theres a lot again that white luminescent algae /none/ everywhere that spiky  crystalline white luminescent algae is everywhere  liam gross  laura cool im excited to get up top  taliesin so as you climb the steps of the pyramid and im going to also point out this is  obviously a manmade pyramid and maybe only about 80 years old and like disneylandbullshit  pyramid definitely a little iffy and has seen better days  liam guys so careful i do not want to get mercered or you guys but especially me lets go  taliesin you dont want to get mercered or marishaed  laura /none/ or that i feel like marishaed is worse  taliesin marishaed is worse in my opinion if youre going to go go quick  liam worse but mercered seems easier to happen  taliesin that requires a power ranger helmet too you make your way up the slightly cartoonish  pyramid at the very top theres another one of those weird little square cube exits that you saw  in the sewer  liam so the pyramid goes all the way to the top  taliesin all the way to the top and then theres a drop ladder that goes /none/ right into a little brick  cavern its only big enough for one person at a time and you have to crawl up on those awful fire  escape ladders from the 40s and theres more of that awful white crystalline algae  travis ill go first this time im very perceptive i can hear and smell and see things  laura its really high though baby  travis im a fucking vampire ill fly up there i go and i try to fly  taliesin cool actually im so fucking with you  travis aw damn it i thought /none/ i was going to lost boys that shit fuck  taliesin you cool you aint that cool are you actually going to try and give me a dexterity  athletics  travis okay wait mumbling all successes no failures and one ten  taliesin how many successes  travis one two three four five  taliesin you dont fly but you manage after you make a good leap and by the time you realize

can see through  taliesin oh yeah you can see through it its just a gate  sam is it night still  /none/ taliesin it is still night just barely  sam so wait theres a gate that prevents us from leaving this crypt  taliesin well its not locked or anything its just a gate  travis does anybody else want to open the fucking door for once  taliesin im not going to make you fight doors it is getting a little cramped in here because  its only big enough for like four coffins and its already two coffins full  liam is there any writing in here  taliesin there is a name no theres actually no writing on /none/ the inside its all on the  outside  laura i open the gate  liam i duck behind one of the coffins  taliesin its filthy but other than that  liam okay thats fine  taliesin all right you step out into the late night it feels like time did not move at an  appropriate speed like the night is still darker than it should be you dont know how long you  were down there but it feels like you were down there a little longer than this  laura is it possible an entire day /dung/ passed while we were down there because its still real super dark  taliesin its entirely possible but youre not sure  sam we were so fast that we got here in like ten minutes  travis is there a name on the outside of the crypt that we walked out of  taliesin mmhmm it just says macbeth  liam now thats happy  travis

feed  travis no i am going to do a little natural selection is there anyone that looks /none/ like they  are weak and clearly ailing and ready to have it all come to an end  liam im looking for loners  taliesin if you walk around a little bit  laura im suddenly super uncomfortable with it  sam is there a group of these guys of these humans  taliesin are you going to look around and find a potential

them to you guys rather  than us trying to chase them well drive them this way  /none/ travis question if we try and herd them wont they be doing that human thing called screaming  and making a racket  sam but its a cemetery and theyre hipsters they could be joking around with each other  liam im already gone im looking for somebody on their own im looking for an antelope away  from the herd  taliesin okay and ill add you still have two lizard people who have now put up little hoods so  theyre a little more incognito but its hollywood so who really would notice two people  with lizard

teeth  sam nope you got other stuff but not cake  taliesin so we had left the cemetery and its roving hipsters and film crews and will friedle  were slowly making our way through the city up to  travis i just realized liam has the habit of killing npcs before they ever utter a word well  i guess he protested through the door  taliesin this is why every person that we know who i know i cant do an impression of i /none/ just  introduce them to liam and i know its never going to be a problem should have just given you mary  elizabeth that would have just been easy peasy because i cant do that we make our way slowly up  to sunset boulevard where you are brought to the door of los globos a skeezylooking club its  maybe two three stories its hard to tell its built into a hill its hard to get an idea of the  place you cant tell how big it is really its just got a big red fiery sign /none/ that says los  globos on the front and theres a doorman in there  laura is he a vampire  taliesin you dont know  laura you cant tell  taliesin you cant tell i could tell  liam whats los globos  laura its a club where vampires are  liam but what does it mean  laura the globes  sam the balls the

his clicker waiting for you guys to walk in  laura i smile at him  sam we dont have ids  laura im trying to make you smile back at me  taliesin you dont need /tavern/ ids youre fine  sam because we

definitely sticky in here and /dung/ its  dark and theres some thumping music  travis hemoglobin sticky or alcohol sticky  taliesin alcohol sticky  laura its like a blade club where they bring humans in and then when the music hits then  everybody gets bit  sam i never understood why would anyone go into those clubs if people were dying all the time  taliesin because thats just the best club there is for reasons of a that i dont want you  screaming over each other and b finding music that i could have used on short notice is just  /none/ ridiculous there is thumping dropping industrial music in this club there are people dancing  laura i start dancing  taliesin its definitely a goth industrial club theres some hairstyles theres multicolored  hair theres a lot of people wearing black clothing there is a lot of lights and laser  effects theres a dj doing his job whos a little old and craggily and there is nothing you  recognize off the top of your head but it looks like a decent goth club  liam can i get a drink out of habit  sam and laura we /none/ have no money  liam we dont theres nothing in my pants anymore  laura no they took all of our stuff  liam just all my shit  sam we can barter some blood or something i dont know maybe you could convince him with your charms  laura maybe check and see if the bartender is a vampire  sam are there ladies on the dance floor  taliesin

that  taliesin whats your  sam one  taliesin /none/ no youre hungry but youre fine  sam ill continue ill spin her back around and say that was so hardcore  taliesin suddenly a completely different elbow ends up in your chest from somebody else there  is another  sam this is not the electric slide i grew up with  taliesin theres a guy with long black hair and hes wearing a little tie and a nice vest and  suddenly another elbow is right in your chest  laura i walk over to sam and be like you just dont trust me just dont  taliesin /none/ and thats what happens when you try and hit on people on the dance floor at a goth club  travis i make my way over to laura and sam im like sam i need your what are you doing  sam im working this girl right here i think im going to  taliesin the girl turns to you and goes hes really not  travis my apologies i pull him off the dance floor with laura  laura me too  travis yeah so there is a vip lounge but we apparently need to be on the list /tavern/ i dont know  how to do that youre fast as shit how about i distract or  sam is there a clipboard list  travis maybe  laura i could sneak past him  taliesin you seem to recall he had an iphone  sam well i could superfast try to type one on his iphone but that seems like hes going to  catch me right im not that fast  travis or if theres a payphone at the bar we could call and pretend to be  sam if you distract him i could whiz by him /none/  travis shes also nighinvisible  sam we could both and then we could come out and be like hey let our friends in  laura oh our friends yeah thats good  travis ill do that  sam okay how are you going to distract him  travis i got it so i walk back up to the bouncer and i start in the normal roped area and i move to  his opposite side so that he has to follow me with his vision the thing about fingers is you  dont really need all of them and /dung/ ill snap this finger off just break it right there  laura why  taliesin can you do that  travis yeah  taliesin this is a trick or are you really doing it  travis im really breaking my own finger  taliesin you just want me to say stanima and im going to do it for you stanima oh man im going  to add survival i know thats weird but im adding survival to this stanima and survival  stanima im saying it  laura im going to go over against the wall in the dark and /none/ obfuscate  travis three successes no failures  taliesin youre even doing the hands right yeah you do not even break eye contact with him do you  travis ill just cracking sound  taliesin dude whats wrong with you man  sam is he distracted  travis it normally stays  taliesin hes definitely staring at a broken finger  sam im going to wait and see if laura gets through before i dash  laura you cant even see me  sam oh well thats why  taliesin youre going to wait a while  laura can i /none/ try to go  taliesin you can try to go  laura and do i need to roll to obfuscate  taliesin let me doublecheck because  laura i roll my hunger roll  taliesin you got to roll a 1d10 and tell me what you get  laura three  taliesin you are now one more hunger die up but i think you could just do it im just  doublechecking because  laura hunger roll wits and stealth  taliesin oh now you have to roll wits and stealth thank you i was looking for that  laura /none/ like you do  sam whats going on under the pacman suit you dont know  laura two successes  taliesin he rolled really poorly and he was pretty distracted yeah you would have my  undivided attention im just saying that if you broke a finger in front of me i would not be  looking at anything else  travis im hoping that vampires have amazing regenerative powers  taliesin thats actually a good point i think you definitely have to take a point of damage so  just mark off that you just took a point of /tavern/ damage  laura is that on your health  taliesin yeah under the health bar just put a line through one of those  laura what is this health and humanity stuff that we havent even looked at yet  taliesin humanity were ignoring because its because im deciding that its far more  interesting to play with when you have a longer more complicated game  liam humanity is in the porta potty with friedle right now  taliesin its sadly at the moment weve dropped humanity  sam did i see laura get through  taliesin no shes /none/ nigh invisible  sam well then is he still distracted  taliesin hes still staring at a finger  sam im going to bolt past him  taliesin all right roll a d10  sam just 1d10 two  travis what if i pulled it out  taliesin you got a hunger die  sam dont worry i have plenty over here  taliesin oh yeah im throwing them out anyway as it makes me feel excited lets do dexterity and  dodge to see if you can get past this guy  sam ooh not good  taliesin its /none/ okay hes distracted  sam well okay thats one roll oh wait that has to be another hunger dice oh wait that knocked  that one over this is one success one blood fail  taliesin one blood fail i think you stand there staring for a little while at where laura was  wondering if she was going to go and you stand there and stare for so long that you dont realize  that he is actually the bouncer is like im going to go get you some gauze or something man  no ill be right back /tavern/  travis you dont even really is it bleeding  taliesin oh thats nasty man  travis is the bone out  taliesin yeah thats a little nasty hes going to walk to the bar and once he goes to the  bar you make a dash up  laura we can all go up the bouncers gone lets go  travis is he going to be looking for me you got to do what you need to do  sam what youre going to stay  travis yeah theres four of us three go go  sam oh god /tavern/ does it hurt  travis not yet the vampire shock will wear off in a second  taliesin fun fact there is no such thing as vampire shock  travis and then all the humans in this bar will be dead  sam do you need me to bite your finger to pour my regenerative blood on it or anything  travis yeah  sam i will bite his finger  taliesin roll a strength plus two since theres no real  laura and sam critical success  taliesin those are two blood criticals  sam two blood criticals and /none/ a fail  taliesin okay so this is called a messy critical so you bite his finger clean off  travis laughs what the fuck  sam im sorry  travis shouting i just said bite it to fix it

taliesin yeah plus two more dice  sam oh okay then one success one fail and two more successes three successes  taliesin you have now managed to damage yourself take a point of damage for gnawing through your wrist  travis what the hell man  taliesin the bouncer is now coming back over and hes coming what  travis this guy not this gentleman this guy that just bolted /none/ for the bathrooms he just pulled my  finger  taliesin you are literally holding his finger right now im just pointing that out  sam listen man we had some bad ecstasy and were just freaking out a little right now  travis do you have a first aid kit ill get out of your hair ill just need a first aid kit  laura can i come down the stairs from above and be like what are you guys doing down here  sam we were trying to do the finger trick  travis we were trying to /none/ get on the list  laura these guys are with me  taliesin wow roll a charisma persuasion thats so solid man thats some comic con shit right  there fuck  travis a voice from above says  laura two successes one blood fail  taliesin two successes one blood fail this guy aint that bright  sam theres a lot of fails  laura well yeah but those dont count its only blood fails that count  sam is that true  taliesin theyre the ones that really count this is more than im really up for this /none/ is a  lot hes just going to shove i cant  sam well the old bite someones finger off to get in the vip section trick  taliesin you have traumatized this poor bouncer this was not a good night for him  travis is the wound continuing to bleed or does it  sam did my blood heal him at all  taliesin do you want to think about making your finger not be a problem anymore  travis yeah  taliesin are you going to try to meditate upon that  travis yeah  sam im going /none/ to try to put the finger back onto the stump to see if seals  laura hold it maybe it will coagulate or scab over  taliesin roll a hunger die  travis just one  taliesin yeah  liam losing one finger is not the worst  travis four  taliesin let me see hold on  laura better than one  taliesin im trying to find all my stuff here we are your finger does not grow back but it  stops bleeding and crystallizes  travis what does my blood look like  taliesin it is a /dung/ deep dark crystalline red its got a little bit of shimmer to it not twilight  sparkle motherfuckers  travis but thats actually the name of a show  taliesin twilight sparkle  sam its a character from my little pony  liam secret messages  taliesin secret messages its the best but it almost seems to glow with a life of its own  theres something about it thats a little brighter theres something about it thats a  little more  travis brighter than the rest of these murdering fucks  taliesin its part of your aura perception /none/ your blood almost seems to have a life of its own  theres something about it thats supernatural  sam im going to suck his severed finger like a popsicle  travis i am going to resist oh no its the one you took  sam do i get anything out of it  taliesin really really awful fanart but beyond that  sam slurping  groaning  taliesin the best the best fanart  travis always you  laura stop sucking on my husbands finger  taliesin this is not the worst thing ive seen in a vampire game /none/  liam im sure i guess ill show up at the bottom of the stairs now too i wasnt there for that

feed on other vampires  sam oh i didnt know i havent seen that i havent seen that because thats the one with tom cruise  laura right its bad to feed on other vampires  liam i mean are we supposed to be referencing /none/ films for this  taliesin thats pretty much what you have to go on right now  travis its dead blood yeah  sam if my wrist hurts ill think about it sure  laura but in the book

exact same crowd and no one would ever notice its still a bunch of people dressed in black  liam the music doesnt really change too much  taliesin no its just /none/ a different track of the same vibe  liam got it  laura does it feel like blade like are people dressed supercool  taliesin yes actually theres a lot of black leather theres a lot of black vinyl people have  obviously dressed up and done nice makeup you cant tell if necessarily everybody is wearing  the nice makeup but its definitely these are some pretty people who have gone out of their way  to be extra pretty tonight  liam

heightened senses anyone  giving us a look of malcontent  taliesin a look of malcontent theres a mix of faces in the crowd theres definitely some  indifference theres some people who are eyeing you very suspiciously and a few smiling faces who  seem delighted  travis before i look at the /town/ smiling faces do i get any whiff of a giant dog in the crowd  taliesin that would require a blood roll  travis ill do that  laura do we get rid of one of our blood dice from this lager  travis perception and investigation jesus  taliesin yeah i love the toss  travis ill use the heightened senses aspect  taliesin you also lose a blood die because of if you have one you have to be at one at all times  travis two successes  taliesin two successes yeah something smells a little doggish /town/ theres a little wolf but its  not what you had last time its something else  travis can i focus on the smiling faces and see what we see  taliesin yeah theres definitely a bouncing bobbing erika ishii whos

but not  people you know personally but theres definitely  laura celebrities  taliesin theres a few people who have a tv deal in here theres a couple serious tv deals in  here theres definitely a couple familiar faces rounding around nobody that youre close to but  theres a  travis this is a happening spot  taliesin few ironic faces juliet landau wanders through for a second and just nods and walks by  theyre nodding and obviously talking about something and after a while somebody comes /none/ up and  talks to erika for a second in the corner and she comes bounding over they want to talk to you guys  laura okay should we be nervous  taliesin no im sure its fine you just got to be cool you guys are cool  sam were so cool  travis yeah look at sam were totally cool  taliesin you guys are cool yeah its fine and youre taken to a far corner table the  furthest deepest corner so that you have the best its the furthest away from the speakers  its really /none/ nice you can actually talk like humans and there very gently spinning a very  nice cocktail is a mildly irritatedlooking yuri lowenthal  laura oh my god this makes so much sense  taliesin it makes so much sense doesnt it  travis he speaks nine languages  laura like hes a ninja for real  taliesin why they never age the two of them just dont age do they hes just peppering with fake  color in the hair thats all it is  sam its yuri  laura whats up man  taliesin hey i mean this /none/ is weird guys so what happened like honestly we dont know no one  sam long story short geek  sundry legendary theres armageddon over there monsters roving  taliesin well there was a fire its all  travis it was an explosion  sam we set it off  laura we didnt set it off it went off around us  travis you remember matthew colville right  taliesin oh of course  travis yeah we woke up in coffins missing taliesin matt and marisha were killed while we  were trying to figure out what was actually going /none/ on  taliesin well well get to taliesin so colville did this was this his doing  laura no i dont think it was matt that did it i think  liam it all sums back to gary gygax  taliesin wait gygax did this  laura travis and liam yeah  sam we dont know if he did it but he was involved and theres been a changing of the guard  or disturbance in the order of things the lizard people are very upset  laura yeah they said that people go down in their tunnels theyre super /none/ pissed  travis oh yeah i was supposed to give you i didnt think it would be you but im supposed to  say theyre very displeased and that we need to make amends weve got to find a way back to our  friendship you guys are supposed to offer a boon  sam who said that that was  travis mahlo or it was lockey  laura no it was the head of the lizard guys  taliesin so this is all gygax or was this colville and gygax working together  laura so gygax said he wanted /none/ to play with matt mercer but then mercer got killed by the sun and so  taliesin why does that guy got to be so weird man  travis i didnt even know he was alive  liam yuri im so sorry ive got questions  taliesin sure  liam when i met you in 99 2000 were you already in princeton new jersey  taliesin oh no  liam so this is somewhere between  taliesin oh yeah this wasnt part of the plan for a while ive been working towards this so yeah  this has been a /none/ goal for a while  travis and tara too  taliesin oh yeah of course  liam and what about offspring is like alucard like halfsies  taliesin oh no were raising him just perfectly were trying to do it right raising  him normally letting him find himself its going to be a while before we  laura so how long does it take to actually turn  taliesin oh it takes about a week and theres a whole ritual thats involved and usually a  becoming usually somebody well youre supposed to have somebody  laura nobody walked /none/ us through it  taliesin yeah this is a problem there is  travis rats man we ate rats  laura is that bad i didnt mind  liam some of us ate rats  taliesin normally theres a process for this and this is a problem youre supposed to have a  sponsor lets put it this way  sam like tor books  taliesin like tor books tor books youre supposed to have a sponsor and really this is  tricky because theres a process to just make sure you dont go around killing people and making a /none/  scene in these things and theres really and you guys havent done anything inappropriate yet have you  travis raise your hand if you havent done anything inappropriate  sam well i didnt kill any innocent people  laura i mean the only person that i killed got burned up in the fire when everything so it  wasnt like we left any evidence you know  taliesin yeah wow  sam no bodies around in public places  laura yeah nowhere in public  liam im clean as a whistle  travis and as far as monsters go /none/ thank god we know you right seems like youre pretty high up  right now  taliesin yeah i mean im not that high up though im really here because they thought that  you should have a familiar face and theres a bunch of us here whore in it for you guys but  theres a lot of conversation about what to do with the four of you we dont even know what  family you belong to this is all so complicated  sam are families assigned to us  taliesin you see this is the problem  /none/ travis like a foster situation or  taliesin sighs this is where things get so complicated  liam we are ready to learn spill it girl spill it  taliesin well sighs weve been giving this a lot of thought and  laura are you adopting us  taliesin i wish i could im not i just dont really have that kind of  sam are you going to kill us  taliesin no im not going to do that but that has come up as an option  laura oh no  travis sure would love to avoid that /none/  sam we could prove ourselves in a cruciblestyle  laura yeah we can get sorted give us a family  liam were getting ahead of ourselves yuri whats the deal  taliesin well youre going to need some kind of sponsor or were going to have to deal with you  laura how do we get a sponsor  liam yeah what do we do  taliesin i dont know i guess ill see if theres anybody around whos up to dealing with this and  were going to have to get im going to have to get just /none/ a little bit of blood from all four of  you because we have to figure out who you are and where you belong so  laura and travis yeah  taliesin he pulls out a little pinprick and a couple cups a couple little wine glasses  travis i stab my newly healing finger  sam reslice open my wrist  laura im going to look for my big this vein and im going to stick it in there  taliesin it doesnt really do what you were hoping it was going to do but you get some stuff /none/  out of there it is as if the circulation is not really moving the way its supposed to you can  juice it  sam ugh it personally makes me physically uncomfortable  taliesin yeah it makes me so happy its all im really going for  liam all my veins are noticeably large so i dont think i have a problem  taliesin yeah youre a little crusty all over too but you get in there your skin got a little  crusty  travis do you know whats wrong with liams face  taliesin nothings wrong with /none/ liams face its totally normal  liam nothings wrong with liams face  travis i dont know how to break it to you man youre a little flakey  laura almost a lizard person  taliesin yeah thats a tricky one were going to have to deal with that  liam ive been like that for years man  taliesin really  liam yeah  laura how much blood do you need i filled the cup up like halfway  taliesin yeah that will do it so everybody gets a die you got a hunger die you got a hunger /none/  die you got a hunger die you got a hunger die  liam billy mays here for vampirism  taliesin so they go take those in back yuri gets up on stage stops the dj ladies and  gentlemen we have a bit of a conundrum gary went and did something dumb this week and i think we  all saw it
