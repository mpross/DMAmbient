hello everyone and welcome back to critical role so picking up where we left off  after vox machina had taken a year of peace and activity to handle their own respective endeavors  or communal endeavors they discovered apparently some family of pike trickfoot coming and knocking  at the door of whitestone a reunion with some of her family she had not seen since she was a child  coming in to impart her with the knowledge of a terrible family bloodcurse /none/ that had been haunting  them for ages and visions that were guided by her uncle ogden to the possibility that she carries  the same curse and wanting to free the bloodline or at least pike of this they had to amass some  materials and make their way on a moonlit night to the top of the alabaster sierras to complete the  ritual to exorcise this entity and destroy it after gathering the materials and traveling to the  top of the salted bluffs of the alabaster sierras the ritual was completed and the large monstrous  /none/ black cloud and skull entity is summoned forth from pikes body and you all leapt in to do  battle however partway into this fray vex happened to realize that it was seemingly an  illusion there was no ritual there was no blood curse and this was a ploy from the family to make  a little cash off you guys after some threats to uncle ogden and nearly losing him off the edge of  a cliff you made a deal to offer some money in exchange you took your cousin jb under your wing  and they /none/ were forced to leave and never return they accepted and went on their way and with  that we begin todays episode so you guys have been traveling down the side of the mountain of  the alabaster sierras returning latenight to the city of whitestone what do you wish to do  travis kill them all before we change our mind  laughter  laura oh can i cast locate object and try to find that diamond that he chucked over the side  matt whats the range on locate object  travis was it a thousandfoot cliff  /none/ taliesin it was far down there  liam well ive probably got about 30 or 40 minutes left on the  sam you could fly down some of us own flying brooms  laura yeah we can fly down on flying brooms  liam do that yeah i can go swimming  laura shit i dont have my thing  liam your thing  laura that says what the distance on locate object is  matt the distance is 1000 feet of you  laura okay so can i get on my broom and cast it and go try to /none/ find it down in the water  matt sure it lasts for ten minutes  laura okay  matt ill say go ahead and make an investigation check  laura im organizing my dice right now 19  matt 19 okay it takes you the better part of the next ten minutes or so to even get a blip on  your arcane radar and you suddenly sense as youre coasting along the very base of the surf  where the waters crash against the rocks the tide has been coming in with the full moon and you can  /none/ see now the water itself is rough and just smashing into the side of the cliff base you get  a small glimmer a small beacon a draw to you like a small pulling under the waves and you  sense about maybe 65 feet down there it is  laura 65 feet  travis under the water  matt under the water  travis thats three diving tanks for competitive diving  laura so probably couldnt do it unless i have breathing underwater  liam or your friend keyleth  laura shes up top would i remember the spot /none/ in the fucking water if i went up and got her and  brought her back down do i have enough time to do it  matt you could try and remember it and come back  sam its 1000  laura its 1500  taliesin are we within earpieceshot  matt not with her right now youd have to go back up  laura okay i fly straight up from the spot so i dont lose it  matt all right youre pretty much on the cusp of it youve been a little flexible on the range of  /none/ them but well say you get a little ways up  laura and i say keyleth can you swim  marisha chuckles yes  laura can you come help me get this diamond back  marisha oh yeah yeah  laughter  marisha am i on the cliff  matt youre on top of the cliff yeah  marisha is she down  matt yeah  laura i can come oh are you really  marisha can i do it  laura thats a really high drop  marisha can i do the pocahontas swan dive  matt okay make /none/ an athletics check  marisha i run and cliff dive  laura oh jesus oh no  taliesin sings sail  marisha sings sail  laughter  laura oh no  marisha 11  matt okay you get a few feet past the cliff edge not a majestic jump and the cliff is not  completely sheer it does slightly angle outwards so you gently leap off and as youre falling you  can see you probably have id say about 300 feet or so before youre going to hit rock  marisha im going to hit rock  matt /none/ the cliff is not perfectly vertical its a little bit angled and youre heading down to hit  the rock  marisha i go oops and can i do a gust against the cliff wall to push me back a little bit  further  matt go ahead and make a wisdom check this is a straight wisdom modifier check  marisha oh thats good just straight wisdom modifier 20  matt okay like a gentle fart you push yourself a little ways from the cliff ill say it does  just enough of a shove where the trajectory changes /none/ slightly you may or may not be right  where the rock hits the surf you can test it or not its up to you  travis test it  taliesin and this was the end  laura kiki dont kill yourself over this rock  liam it was nice being in a couple  marisha at the last minute im going to panicked squealing and turn into a goldfish  travis before you hit the water  sam or the rock  marisha well im assuming the goldfish would make it easier to hit water  laura yeah but /none/ youre going to hit rock  sam goldfish are not magnetically attracted to water they still just fall  laura what about flying fish or something so you can maybe  marisha i dont think flying fish actually fly though  laura no but they got big fins  travis they do glide  matt regardless as you turn into a goldfish rocketing towards the base of the water  laura and sam oh no  travis hes taking a picture of it  matt no im not this is too many dice for me to roll  gasping  /none/ ashley what  marisha i would just pop back to myself i wouldnt die  matt and then any additional damage would go over into your  marisha no i know  travis theres too many dice to roll marisha  marisha no its fine were gods  laura are we she says as she dies on the rocks  travis why would you even tempt that shit  taliesin why am i drinking your coffee im going to stop right now  sam oh boy  laura oh no what is he doing no seriously though what if she /none/ just died  marisha that would be kind of amazing  matt you took 363 points of damage  marisha you are lying you are lying by hitting rocks  matt by hitting rocks at terminal velocity its 1d6 per ten feet falling keyleth scatters across  the edge of the rock and just crumples into the surf and is now floating  marisha wait what you are lying  matt no you just  sam what does that mean thats below her total hit points  travis thats instant death  matt no shes dead keyleth is dead and /none/ floating in the water  sam unrevivable death  matt probably revivable youve just got to retrieve the body  laura and ashley oh my god  sam wait vex i gave you a coin  laura a revivify coin  marisha wait i thought you were trying to make it out like id still hit water  matt i said the distance you jumped and then pushed  travis you jumped from 1000 feet in the air totally logical you cant even see the water or  rocks but youre like yep ive got this bitch  liam i /none/ am having the best conversation with jb right now  marisha this is the best thing thats ever happened  laura wait but heres the thing do i have to roll if i use the coin  matt and now officially every member of vox machina has died most in battle or some danger  travis that took care of it  sam you broke the seal  marisha wait was i supposed to turn into a flying creature and be safe from this  matt thats up to you thats literally your choice  liam okay i am starting /none/ to sweat who sees it i dont see it  matt the only person that sees it is vex vex you watch as keyleth jump poof splat its a  scatter of red mess and you see her floating in the water  ashley its only 715  matt i know this was not in my plan  ashley okay go get her  laura i go fly down there is she a body at least  sam because she hit as the goldfish  matt yes and the goldfish which has a hit point  sam and marisha yeah /none/  matt which then made the other 324 hit points go over to marisha  sam sure  travis so the goldfish turned into orange marmalade  liam it was like a magic trick it was like a fish turned into a corpse  laura can i use my coin that tary gave me my coin of revivify on her  matt because you gave it to her before the battle right yes you can  laura okay i do that dont touch my dice in anger  liam im not angry  laura i dont know how do i /none/ do it  matt go ahead and roll a straight wisdom check  laura a wisdom check  matt yes  laura yells im so nervous  ashley stop laughing travis stop it  laura okay  travis i mean you cant feel bad about it  marisha i thought i was going to hit water and it would be cool  laura 18  matt 18 okay as you go down and pull her out of the water her soaked red hair covers her face  and thats probably a good thing as youre a little scared to see /none/  travis its like a redhaired the ring  matt and with that you instinctively begin to seize up and you sob and then you realize the  coin and you fumble for it in your pocket and you hear the waves crashing below you and you  pull it out and you hold it in your palm and you feel it glowing warm in your hand as you press it  against the back of keyleths broken body and you watch as the warmth passes from the coin through  her back and as it does you watch as /none/ her broken limbs all snap back into place  laughtergagging  matt and she begins to breathe again  laughter  liam what the shit is this show  matt i dont know this was not in the  marisha screaming that was higher than i thought  matt keyleth by the way looks wrecked shes still scratched everywhere shes covered in  blood but shes alive at one hit point  laura kiki that was really really stupid i put my hands on both sides of her face and cast cure  wounds at 4th level oh no at /none/ 3rd level because i used grasping vine last time  matt yeah 3rd level okay so 3d8 plus your wisdom modifier  ashley oh my god  sam i better go check on them ill dive off the cliff  laughter  travis yeah good just a little drop  matt that was a beautiful dd moment right there  laura oh my god  liam vax is sitting with jb right now going like so what was pike like when she was really  little little for a gnome  taliesin we all were wearing the necklace so we /none/ all got a beep  matt you did briefly  liam i was really paying attention to jb though  travis is yours broken i think mines broken  taliesin i felt something  laura keyleth  marisha ive been really stressed out here lately and that might have been very impulsive  and i might have been blowing off some steam and im really sorry crying i thought it was going  to be fine i didnt know there was going to be rocks  laura maybe next time youre diving off a cliff turn into a bird  /none/ marisha oh  laura yeah  marisha it might have been a lastminute panic  laura im glad youre back  marisha thanks that was  laura you know what lets not even worry about that coin there i mean the diamond i feel like  maybe  marisha i could go get it now its fine im here now  laura oh my god  marisha i feel really bad because i feel bad about that im sorry  laura i think maybe this is a lesson learned in what is worth risking our lives for  travis is /none/ there a cloud of red in the water  matt there was but the waves are crashing pretty heavy luckily vex grabbed her immediately  because otherwise her body would have been thrown under the rocks again by the surf i just  explained the ocean to you before you jumped thats what would have happened  travis a thousand feet was all you needed  taliesin we have some amazing physics books that we will actually get into at some point  laura how about you just climb onto the broom dont worry about flying right now  marisha /none/ i can go get the thing  laura were just going up  marisha i still have a beast shape left  laura were just going to go up  marisha okay  laura were leaving  travis shes covered in gore right  matt okay yeah shes covered in blood  laura price paid i think  matt so as you guys are talking to jb whos still stunned by the whole thing all of this  happened pretty quickly so shes not necessarily opening up entirely but shes like well you  know we were both troublemakers  /none/ liam yeah because shes got a wild streak now does that run in the family or is that just her  and you  matt oh that definitely runs in the family she looks over to you pike again and is like  i am so sorry i didnt  ashley its okay  matt ill try and make it up to you  ashley just know i dont want you to if you dont want to stay here you dont have to stay  here im not holding you here against your will in any way but i would /none/ love for you to stay  because i would love to get to know you better  matt how could i say no chuckles ill stay until you need me to leave  ashley okay  matt at which point you watch as vex and keyleth and the broom come up and land on the cliffside  taliesin have you two found that diamond oh sweet pelor  laura you know what were not going to worry about the diamond right now yeah lets just  maybe take a moment and recover from that battle which was so hard on /none/ everyone  ashley what happened  liam what you what  laura shes fine shes fine  sam shes more blood than person  ashley do we need to fix anything  laura maybe pike if you can do a little  ashley yes cure wounds  laura whispers tary  sam what  laura whispers i used your coin  sam oh oh  laura i know  sam im glad i gave it to you then ooh  marisha its fine i can go back and get that diamond now i feel really bad right now  taliesin /none/ i think somebodys got a carpet ride down the hill coming to them  liam im casting lay on hands for my piddly 20 hit points what did you do  marisha i thought itd be fun i havent had a lot of fun here lately okay it felt like the old  days of when vox machina was back together because weve been away for a while  ashley you just dove off free willynilly  laura you know those rocks came out of nowhere i thought you were in the clear as well all i  saw was /none/ keyleth and then this little tiny fleck of gold and then gone  travis wait did you miss did you hit  liam did you die  marisha its fine  liam she looks like a fucking macabre mess what happened  ashley i forgot that thats what that was i felt a whirring you know  marisha its been a lot of responsibility here lately and a lot of being an adult and so i was  like vox were reckless  liam thats what alcohol is for dont jump off cliffs anymore please  travis yeah you fucked /none/ up that was crazy  taliesin i have to confess ive been feeling a bit stircrazy myself not jumpoffcliffs  stircrazy dear god  liam and i turn her bloody face to you and say let this be a lesson to you then  taliesin im just saying that i understand the impulse this was not necessarily the best  expression of it  travis we should go on a hunt thats what we need  taliesin i think lets take a nap and then maybe go out  liam i start kissing the gory mess in my hands all /none/ over her forehead  marisha thats gross dont  matt thats pretty gross you marked off the 300 gold for the revivify right  sam oh how many  matt revivify it consumes a diamond worth 300 gold  sam 300  travis keyleth did that hurt did it hurt  marisha it felt like blackness  travis blackness  marisha it felt like a lot of adrenaline and it was super exciting and then next thing i knew  everyone was super concerned about my wellbeing  sam are you addicted to death now  marisha no  sam /none/ have we healed her up a bit  ashley im going to heal her up a little more  sam i can do a healing draught for her  ashley a what  sam healing draught  marisha did you guys know hitting water and rocks from very high feels like hitting rocks  taliesin i literally have books on the subject  matt keyleth as you turn around you watch as tary is handing you this small glass vial of what  looks to be what color liquid is it  sam its colorless and odorless  matt okay /none/ its like a thicker water  marisha whats this  sam just drink it itll make you feel better  marisha i just dove off a cliff so fuck it at this point  matt how much does she heal  sam i rolled on my iphone 37 its 8d8  matt keyleth you heal 37 hit points  marisha oh jesus 37  laura do yours too  ashley yeah ill do a cure wounds i havent used any spells lets do 5th level  travis 5th level yeah  marisha im fine dont worry about me  ashley /dung/ where are you at now  marisha im good 104  taliesin lets all go home have a drink and discuss this over a drink  marisha why what why  taliesin because i think this may speak to a larger issue amongst us that maybe you are the  canary in the coal mine here  laura i heard were gods before she hit  taliesin was it im a golden god  marisha i said im a golden god but you know what im still alive i wasnt entirely wrong  taliesin youre not still alive youre alive /none/ again  liam we should celebrate because weve broken in the entire group  taliesin yes i think everybody has at least been dead for a moment at this point  marisha was i dead  taliesin technically yes  travis look how much red is all over you  matt enough to the point where if you die again your resurrection dc has gone up  be aware of that  taliesin we could make another kiki out of what youre wearing right now  laura have you died died tary died died  sam did i die i /none/ think i died in the water i think i died  matt he did  taliesin he died at the palace  sam think i died  laura lets go home  marisha why are you looking at me like that dont look at me like that  laura im not looking at you like anything you need a bath is what you need  travis yeah youre covered in shit  laura its really a lot right now  ashley i say we go back i would love to go back and maybe have lots of drinks  sam /none/ lets go home  liam jb welcome to the family  matt shes just like eyes wide open right she clutches her book a little closer to her chest as you  guys begin to make your way down the mountainside a different path than the other trickfoots were  taking  ashley good call  taliesin maybe we need a hobby  travis well never beat that death  laura thats like keylethfallinginlava bad  taliesin that was magical  matt marisha how many fail compilation videos have you seen where people jump off the cliff and  hit /none/ just at the bottom that was what you did  marisha laughing it was totally a fail video  travis we were in a huge fight with a fake thing that did no damage and you killed yourself in four  seconds  liam i got this  travis were gods vomit sound unreal couldnt write it  marisha i thought i could make it  matt i was like one to 50 she hits the water 51 to 100 she hits the rock 94  marisha so i hit the rock  matt yeah thats what happens  travis /none/ either way you were really screwed  taliesin to be fair a goldfish even at that velocity although the velocity would have  lessened it more  marisha i should have bailed out as a bird  liam makebelieve has consequences  taliesin thats so true  matt over the course of the next day or little over a day you camp once in the parchwood and  make your way back to whitestone  liam is 15 hours of that therapy  matt for you yeah  marisha i love how out of everything weve seen what i just /dung/ did was apparently the most  fucked up out of everything thats happened to us and now we need therapy now we need  therapy  taliesin we were living tolkien and now weve suddenly shifted into game of thrones it got very  dark very random very quickly  travis gods dead five seconds hard to beat  liam we all stand for something what do you fall for  matt you find your way back to whitestone you check in the guards are happy to see that youve  returned fine they report to you that the trickfoot /none/ clan have not returned and have not been  seen near the city since your return there are few questions as to where they went  taliesin were going to have their vehicle searched for anything that doesnt belong to them  and then made ready for them outside the city bounds  matt very well sir and they search through it and mostly whats found in there are maybe 102  gold pieces  taliesin do we have anybody with a criminal background search the vehicle  matt i mean there are a number of people  taliesin i /none/ would like someone extremely sketchy to search actually vax would you search the  vehicle  ashley and jb if there is anything you need out of there  travis you have chocolate on your face  matt jb wipes it with a thumb  taliesin including anything that you think would be in more capable hands if they were  in your hands  matt she shakes her head and wait she climbs up on the cart and she comes back and has a book  like a small tattered book and she puts it to her side thats /none/ all i dont care about the rest  ashley okay  taliesin vax quick check to see if theres anything we care about  liam oh so good investigation yeah 18  matt 18 you find the gold you find a cache of dried jerky meats you find what looks to be some  leftover meat pie crust bits that have been there for a few days starting to smell a little bit  and you get the sense that anything of importance was on their persons they werent really storing  a lot of things in an open cart /none/  liam this has been a bad couple of days  taliesin all right just wanted to make sure there wasnt anything sighs complicated leave  the gold obviously and the food  matt all right  sam burn the wagon  laughter  matt as you say that dotys like tary  sam and ashley no  sam you have to learn humor doty sarcasm  matt all righty so what do you want to do  sam is it night  matt by the time youve returned its probably late afternoon well say at this point because  /none/ its been about a little over a day and a half at this point so yeah midafternoon  laura shit  sam what should we do  laura i dont know  sam we can go check on the slayers cake  laura oh yeah we should probably do that its been a couple of days  sam yeah  laura what did we do with it while we were gone  sam did we have someone running it do we have someone  matt laughs you do not  taliesin theres a sign that

would you even be interested in maybe running a  bakery or is that something that just sounds like the /none/ most dreadful thing in the world  matt nervous laugh i dont know and she pulls her hair i could try  laura how are you at math  matt im quite good at math actually  laura fabulous lets head there and see how you do  sam yes lets see but not make any promises because someone whos never run any  laura right tary you would know about hiring people far more than  sam we should have a proper interview  laura right  sam check references  liam well you werent a proper adventurer until /none/ you were got to start somewhere  sam true but i had the advantage of being able to buy my way in  laura thats true but you were still pretty shitty at it when we first started  taliesin this is a form of nepotism its pretty reasonable  sam im open to it  matt all right is everyone going to the slayers cake  laura yeah because we can eat too  matt okay right you guys all make your way to the slayers cake as the afternoon is coming to a  close dusk is starting /dung/ to change the colors of the sky clouds are beginning to move in as the  nights evening air grows colder as you come to the outside you see its dark and closed and  you see what appears to be a figure sitting on the ground against the wall back to the wall knees  huddled up  sam not jb  matt no jb is walking with you guys  sam in front of the bakery  matt by the door a little bit adjacent to where the door is closed  laura we dont recognize them can /none/ we see their face  matt make a perception check  taliesin is this the same day or has it been a day now  sam its been a day  taliesin oh thank god  laura no 30  matt laughs yeah you see actually a woman in her late thirties or so early forties  platinumblonde hair thats pulled up in a ratty bun shes got strands hanging in the front of her  face that go to about just past her chin she has a very simple dress and a somewhat dirty apron and  a small /none/ satchel on her side and shes leaning against the wall her knees clutched to her shes  looking forward she hasnt noticed you guys yet youre a little ways up  laura and i dont recognize her  matt no you do not recognize her  laura excuse me  matt oh and she gets up and stands up and grunting her back creaks a little bit and she  stretches it and dusts off the front of her apron you see little bit of dust poof im  terribly sorry i wasnt sure when you were going to be /none/ coming back  laura oh yeah no we were just off on an adventure but itll take a little while before  the food is ready  matt oh that sighs if you have a moment fine sirs and madams im sorry to bother you you  see my husband dathen has not returned from sea in about six months and im not certain if hes  coming back and im without work and coffers he left me have come empty this month so could you  perhaps use a hand here at the bakery  laura timing is quite /none/  matt it was ridiculous timing yeah  sam madam whats your name  matt hilda  sam and you would like a job at our bakery  matt if at all possible  ashley do you bake  matt i do she reaches into her satchel and you see in the inside she has a bunch of these small  things wrapped in paper and she opens one and pulls it out and shows it to you you see its  this tiny little cream puff its perfectly made and has a little icing on the top shes like /none/  i used to just make these for old dathen but  sam may we try it  matt of course she goes and pulls a handful out and hands them amongst you and gives them  over  ashley this is a beautiful cream puff  laura theyre really hard to make  sam quick sidebar this is better than anything weve ever made  laura did you already eat it  sam yes it was really good  laura im going to wait a few minutes to see if tary looks like he just falls over or anything /none/  sam wait what you think its poisoned  laura no im sure its not  sam i ate it i ate the whole thing in one bite  laura it was really good  sam am i going to die  travis give me all your stuff  taliesin how often do you just eat strangers cream puffs  matt her eyes go wide and like mumbles  sam am i going to die did you just

to  laura do you live here in whitestone  matt i do i live right behind and she points up to the left like if the sun tree is in the  center and you head up straight on the eastern side sorry the western side of the square the  path that leads up towards whitestone castle she points about two blocks up and on the left and  theres a small hovel thats pushed between two buildings there and she goes  thats where i stay  ashley can i insight check her /none/ because i dont trust anybody  laura i dont trust anybody  matt go for it  laura it just makes us seem like assholes because were like grumbles i want to go in a  little bit and ask around and see what people think of her  travis what a background check  laura a little background check  ashley 27  matt 27 okay  sam the whispers  ashley i get a whisper  sam have you never had a whisper  ashley i dont think on the show ive had a whisper  sam oh /none/ my god everybodys firsts tonight backblaze ladies and gentlemen

sam have you worked anywhere else  matt no /none/ ive mostly just been a housewife until recently  sam do you have anyone in the community who could vouch for your character and trustworthiness  matt perhaps norma kell wakes up in the morning theres also keeper yennen  sam oh keeper yennen we know him i think right we know him  laura yeah we know keeper yennen  matt yeah aye thats all i can think of at the moment  ashley how long has your husband been missing  matt about six months  ashley about six months  laura what was he doing  matt /none/ hes a merchant sailor coming in and out but hed be back within the month usually some  trips took longer but six months seems extraordinarily long for him  sam where did he go again  matt last i know he does a circle around the southern tip of taldorei and he usually hits emon  by ship occasionally heads over to the where is it the shama  travis shambala  matt maybe something like that i dont really know for sure its a long ways away  laura keyleth i whisper to her keyleth can you scry /town/ on people we dont know  marisha if i have a piece of one of their belongings yeah that definitely helps yeah  laura hilda would you like us to check and see if we can potentially find him  matt you can do that  laura well if you have something of his that we can look at we might be able to help  matt oh aye just a moment and she goes and she goes rushing up the street real fast this  renewed excitement in her face  laura how do we feel about her  /none/ sam pike if you were dead set on jb taking over the business  ashley no im not jb dont feel pressured if you dont want to do this shes a fantastic  baker  laura i mean shes a really good baker but maybe jb can handle the books and she can handle  the baking  taliesin well there is another option which is that we have a giant pile of histories and library  and novels in our collected library and we are searching for information about the thing  underneath the castle and we need readers /none/ we need lots and lots of people to read lots and lots  of books  matt jb you watch like the excitement you just saw on hildas face now hits jbs face  im a good reader i can  laura well okay  ashley yeah that seems like a little more fun  matt okay yeah i can also help with this if you want im more than happy to do both i have a  lot of free time now  laura thats true you could run the bakery during the day  sam why dont while /none/ were gone you could help hilda hilda  ashley hilda  sam hilda you could just help out but maybe leave her in charge she seems like a  taliesin or you could sit in the castle and read diaries and ancient tomes of whitestone  marisha do i notice grog looking uncomfortable  taliesin i definitely notice i dont care  liam cell phone ringing oh dear  laura timers done  matt grog does she notice you feeling uncomfortable  travis i dont know do you  marisha i dont know do i  matt grog are you /none/ uncomfortable  travis with this talk of reading a little bit  ashley whispering but grog you can read some of those books a little bit  travis yeah lets not get ahead of ourselves all right  ashley well okay i think this is a great idea  laura im watching where hilda is running  matt okay  travis i had a quick thought if her husbands dead are we just going to tell her that right  now just you know husbands dead hes being eaten by fish  laura no  liam no you didnt get /none/ a read  laura yeah so keyleth if you like do read it and you see its super bad dont  liam oh its too hazy i cant see him  travis that doesnt seem right at all  ashley no but i think she should plan for her life if hes not coming back  travis yep pike and i are in agreement  laura but right now  sam what if hes alive and in peril do we tell her that were going to lose our only employee  laura well then we go try to help him /none/ maybe  sam really we have to go help someone we just met this person  laura thats what we do tary  taliesin we havent done that in quite a while to be fair  travis plus he was in somewhere like shambalam  sam do we know what she was talking about by the way  matt you get the sense she probably was meaning shamel which is the port where you guys had your  vacation the bay of gifts  sam we could go on vacation again  matt about ten minutes or so pass and /none/ then hilda comes back and you see shes clutching what looks  to be a small gold chain and she takes it and goes this belonged to my husband i dont know  if thisll help  laura sure keyleth  sam ignore the blood all over her body  laura shes fine  matt you probably cleaned up over the past day or so travel unless you didnt in which case you  are just a sticky carrie  marisha no i look awesome  liam its dried in the hair though and caked in  marisha im a /none/ little spacey maybe for a little bit  matt yeah understandably you know like you do  marisha its hard to say  matt but anyway she hands you the gold chain  taliesin just checking do you want to know no matter what good or ill  matt oh i just want to know something  taliesin fair enough  marisha what was his name  sam athen  matt yeah it was dathen dathen dathen  marisha can you tell me anything else about him that would maybe help what does he look like  matt hes got /none/ dusty brown hair usually about shoulder length well he doesnt really grow  facial hair but hes pretty scruffy lower the way its been many months so i dont know  medium build maybe about this high and she gives a couple of inches off her own height hes  got a right scar across his neck and his chest right there he got when he was a kid  marisha all right should be enough ill do an actual scrying spell  matt all righty so looking at the scrying spell here all right you sit there and focus /none/ and  concentrate and darkness nothing no link shes looking expectantly  marisha whats that  matt shes looking at you expectantly  marisha hilda if he is on this plane of existence i dont know if its a good sign but  it doesnt mean that he couldnt be lost somewhere else my spell only extends to this plane of  existence but there are many planes i can try again  matt no thats all right thats all i needed to know thank you at this point as the sun is  setting starting to go into the /none/ evening you can see the light causing her to blear a little bit  here in the shade shes like can we perhaps talk in the morning  laura of course take the evening  matt where can i find you up as she points over to the castle  laura sure yeah one of us will be back here tomorrow as well  matt all right thank you and she quietly walks back to the corner of the city  where she was from  laura well shit  marisha well thats not good  liam give the woman /none/ a job keep her busy  laura and ashley yeah  sam im just throwing this out there if that was a ploy to get a higher salary im not biting  laura tary  sam im just saying she could be very cunning  travis yep she might have killed her husband  marisha i dont think so  travis pretty sure she did it  marisha do i have any further inkling  matt no just did not find a source did not find a source nothing nothing for the spell to grab  onto  laura maybe /none/ you and i

laura come on we dont trust anyone  sam she didnt give /none/ us a social security we dont have an i9 theres nothing  laura theres no way to know she could just be in here trying to get close to vox machina before  she takes us all down like raishan  sam she could be raishan  laura she could  taliesin speaking of deeply distrustful persons jb do you want to come see the library does  anybody else want to come  ashley i would love to come  matt yes please  travis yeah me too  marisha are you insinuating that jb isnt trustful  taliesin /none/ oh absolutely in the best possible way im highly excited and i think youre going  to do very well  matt okay  taliesin see  marisha we like untrustworthy people none of us are trustworthy its good  matt i know ive read  laughter  taliesin oh that made me happy  laura we go by her hovel  matt okay as you guys make your way back to the castle you stop and go over there you can see  its one of three small homes that are jammed in the alley areas between these larger /town/ buildings  almost like theres businesses on this one corner and they have smaller people that are living more  meager means each one of them appears to be occupied the one that she pointed to you go to  it and it seems there theres like a very low light through one of the windows  liam im going to be real shitty and stealth up and peek in and see what shes up to  matt okay make a stealth check  laura shes changing crying naked  liam well find out wont we 33 for stealth  /none/ matt all righty and then make a perception check  liam yeah natural 20  matt okay you glance up and over the side and from the low candlelit interior which you watch  as theres a small candle thats lit on a little wick there and theres almost no furniture in  this house whatsoever theres a stool and you just see her sitting on the stool motionless  liam i want to insight check and just get as good a read on her emotional state as i can even  though shes got a thousandyard stare this is /none/ insight  matt yes  liam ill use luck better  travis luck  liam sure why not what am i saving it for 18  matt 18 i mean shes faced away from you its hard to pick up away but to the side and you  just see her just there and you see her rummage through her satchel on the side pull out a cream  puff and eat it  laura theres not even a bed in there just a stool  matt just a stool  liam

tary  liam my significant other just mangled herself i need to keep busy lets go see yennen and so i  lead her off  matt ha okay you guys go ahead and make your way towards yennens small temple in town its past  the evening sun so you see yennens one younger boy who helps him keep the establishment hes in  the process of sweeping some of the fallen leaves and various dust that has found its way

what she does every day  laura who knows she doesnt have a bed  ashley why is there no furniture in her apartment  sam lets watch her work for a day see how it goes  liam did i see more than one room or was it a singleroom home  matt from what you can tell its a single room theres a pile of linens in a corner there was a  stool /none/ it looked like there was a small area for cooking  laura its like skyrim yall theres a stool and a cheese wheel  taliesin and a pot and if you break it theres five coins  marisha and steal their plants from outside  taliesin and throw them at chickens  ashley mountain flowers  marisha nightshade  laura well this was productive  taliesin at least we know and theres no harm in being careful its not like its never happened  before  laura right  taliesin its not the first time that weve been trusting and /none/ been betrayed or the second or the  third its reasonable to be a bit cautious and we were a bit cautious  liam of cakes  taliesin of cakes to be fair we are going to be eating them  travis are we reading right now  taliesin i assume weve gotten to the library i dont know  matt theyve traveled for a bit youve had time to hit the library and begin showing jb around  ashley are there childrens books in here  travis i found one look buseeness buseness  marisha hes learning  travis /none/ buseewhat  laura ashley and marisha business  travis sound it out buseyeness  marisha did you find a ledger is that what you found  taliesin there are books i read as a child  ashley whispers where are they  taliesin everywhere  ashley can i see if i can find a kids book  liam thats pronounced boysness  travis boysness can you use it in a sentence please  liam grog got down to boysness and ended a fools life  ashley 13  matt 13 you find what amounts to a childrens book for percival /none/  taliesin bless you  sam high school biology  taliesin the game of logic by lewis carroll  matt yeah most of the books here are of relatively advanced reading level you gather its  a trait of the de rolo family  taliesin gives me the sense that this kids going to be fine  travis orchid  laura grog you can do the ch  travis orchide  laura and ashley orchid  travis no its not kid  ashley sometimes when those letters are together it sounds like a k  laura what book are you /none/ reading thats about boysness and orchids  travis its an orchid business  laura boysness  travis boysness which is a location in marquet  matt all right are you guys doing anything else for the evening  taliesin just showing her what we would like to pay her to do which is all of these books  theres this huge section that are mostly histories diaries folk tales or otherwise take  one of these slips of paper when you read a book you write your name on it and you leave it in the  book then anytime /none/ you find anything peculiar a ghost story or a strange occurrence in any of  these books anything at all that might be fanciful or unexplained you mark with a piece of  gold thread and put it back on the shelf and then one of the other librarians will come and find that  book and bring it down for further study you just have to find the most interesting of these books  and make sure that theyre well marked  matt i can do that  taliesin i had a funny feeling  marisha what makes them /none/ interesting  taliesin what makes a book interesting i genuinely dont know how to answer that  laura sexy pictures  taliesin theres not a lot of that in this library  marisha are you giving someone parameters by which they dont really have rules to follow  taliesin well thats the trouble with looking for something that if you dont know what it is  marisha right  taliesin but if in one of these diaries someone remarks upon a strange murder or a ghost story or  honestly anything interesting thats a bit peculiar you just mark it /none/ and then we take a look  that way we thin out the amount that  we have to read down to a manageable amount  marisha so it takes a peculiar person to know whats peculiar  taliesin that does help yes  matt okay i can do that  marisha yeah  ashley is there a place just ask percy privately she can stay with me  taliesin i assumed  ashley do i have an extra bedroom or how does this work  taliesin where is pike  laura is she staying in the castle right  /none/ matt she has a room in the castle one that used to be one of the guest rooms when you had people  you were entertaining  ashley maybe theres a murphy bed or something extra in the room  matt its easy enough to put a second bed in there the doorways are wide  taliesin if she would like her own room that can absolutely be arranged  ashley jb do you i dont know how  matt shes in the process of looking and shes like writing down taking notes of the different  sections talking to /none/ herself shes not even looking at you  ashley you are more than welcome to stay with me i do have night terrors so sometimes not fun but  you can stay with me or you could have your own room  matt no thats fine  ashley okay wait which one  matt staying with you is there something i should do if youre having a night terror  ashley just wait it out  matt okay dont wake you up  ashley nah  matt okay  ashley okay this will be fun itll be like sleepovers maybe /none/ we can make a fort  matt we can make forts out of what  ashley just all the blankets tapestries  matt you watch all of a sudden her eyes in this library there are a number of old tapestries and  you know carpet elements around you watch as she scans the entire room for materials and goes  oh we can do this  ashley i have a feeling you are a great fort builder  matt i havent tried but i have some theories  taliesin i pull two engineering books off the shelf and hide /none/ them  matt perfect all right  taliesin i feel like this has been taken care of you know the system  ashley percy thank you  taliesin would you like an extra bed sent  ashley yes please  taliesin that can be arranged  matt okay so you have a second bed installed in pikes room you guys have your dinner for the  evening anything else  taliesin take another look at the thing downstairs  laura well i go with you  matt okay you guys head down into the tunnels make your way to the /none/ ziggurat beneath whitestone  and as you enter the inside of the chamber you can see theres a few torches set up in there  there is that secondary platform where you guys met a year ago where you had the small council  with raishan as well to decide what was to become of the chroma conclave up there you can see  theres a whole research bench set up with a couple of desks and pretty much all the  information thats been gathered and various things that have been studied over the past year  or so /none/ about it what has been figured out and there were theories thrown around before of it  being a siphon an artifact that is related to something that was referred to as a sphere of  annihilation not directly but an offshoot of that type of enchantment as opposed to completely  destroying anything it comes into contact with its attuned in the siphoning of things from one  location to another its a translocation type of magic there have been a number of things that  have been placed within this sphere and did not return including one volunteer /none/ a member of the  pale guard who during the years research volunteered to step through and was not heard from  again and that stopped any future volunteers from rising to the occasion but since the research  thats been taken up about what the siphons existence during the age of arcanum they were one  used as a defensive measure against powerful mages but that was more of a secondary use during  the actual war that ended the age of arcanum their initial creation was supposed to be able to  harness and shift ley line energy /none/ the idea was wherever there was a large source of magical  energy but it was inconvenient its placement its natural placement in the world they could use  these siphons to basically triangulate and shift where that energy would go  taliesin its been here an awful long time now we dont even know if they created it or if they  found it  matt you dont know like the information about them is i would say almost mythological in the  sense that there are stories that talk about them and a lot of the information was /none/ destroyed during  the divergence regarding to the older age of arcanum magics  taliesin the castles always had strange stories  matt yeah and this is information that was brought together by eskil ryndarien when he was  down here researching with allura even during the conclave a lot of people have gone off because  the research hit a wall it was like well we find out pretty much everything about this we just  dont know where the siphon is going and anything weve tried to put through doesnt come back so  the theory is to /none/ find the other half of the siphon because its a connecting point theres two sides  to it so if it this is correct then the theory is there would be another side to it or if not it  might just be a sphere of annihilation or something adjacent to it and is essentially a null  and void circumstance those are where the theories stand  laura percy  taliesin yes  laura the crystal that lillith gave you does that work across planes  matt you have to be on the same plane of existence  laura /none/ okay  taliesin ive thought about it i definitely think theres something on the other side of this  and this thing is how i think i know that our work is not yet done i dream about it sometimes do you ever  come down and just look at it  laura to be honest it intimidates me quite a bit  taliesin what do you see  laura what do i see  can i use my oracle arrow and shoot it into it  matt you can certainly give it a try you can certainly try  /none/ sam whispers whats an oracle arrow  travis she can shoot her arrow  laura and see through the arrow okay what do i do  matt all right well go ahead and roll an attack  laura okay  taliesin lets back up a bit of a distance  laura yeah well back up as far as we can so i can still hit the thing it is a magical arrow  and this thing cuts out all the magic but maybe once it goes through the siphon maybe ill still  be able to use it  taliesin /none/ well we can actually get to the edge where magic starts again and then it might  reconnect once it goes through  laura yeah well stand outside of the door  sam so you only have one of these  laura i have two per short rest  sam oh youre fine  matt as part of your newlyexalted bow okay this is going to be hold on to that roll  whatever that was so to get out of the radius because it basically cuts right into the hallway  that leads inside of it you have to /none/ back out of the chamber into the hallway a few feet and  basically get on the ground and aim upwards towards and youre going to have to arc over the  top of the ziggurat to get in so this is a shot with a disadvantage  liam sharpshooter  laura with disadvantage i am sharpshooter  liam wouldnt that nullify that threequarter cover means nothing its just full cover  matt well what i was going to say it would have a really high ac with disadvantage im not going  to consider it with having a super /none/ high ac its still a very hard shot  laura so disadvantage  matt so disadvantage on the shot  laura 30  sam whoa  liam yeah both were high teens  ashley its critical roles dice  laura it is the critical role dice  taliesin what im so proud of you  sam it shouldnt work  taliesin it shouldnt work but it did  ashley tshirts  sam weirdly the arrow hits and kills keyleth  marisha death rattle not like this  sam dont do that this is a long whisper  liam hes telling /none/ her real stuff man  sam oh man this is not what we normally get  taliesin no this is a whole chunk of stuff  ashley backblaze  sam by the way just a little insight what we normally get on the whispers is  from what you can tell it seems  totally normal and then thats about it  marisha thats actually really accurate  taliesin briefly back in the old days they were experimenting with texting us whispers  sam as far as you can tell he thinks hes telling the truth  ashley i want /none/ to know  taliesin im glad we stopped trying to text each other whispers  sam whoa her mind is blown  laura can i have a pencil i got to write this shit down pencil  taliesin her eyes go white and its just scribbling yay  ashley it was so much  sam shes drawing a weird alien creature  laura i got to write it down or else ill forget  sam big head big eyes small body  taliesin three syllables were being invaded by dingbats  marisha what does a smiley emoji mean i dont /none/ understand  sam she speaks arrival language now  laura oh my god percy i saw something  taliesin you didnt really  laura i did i think it was another plane  liam vex dies  taliesin we have to figure out how to is there a way to make sure we get every detail im  finding pen and paper were writing everything you can remember down is there a way to recall  someones memory in perfect detail is there any sort of magic that can actually  matt there are yeah  taliesin okay this shits /none/ happening  laura otherwise i could just tell you what i sort of saw but i heard a lot of backblaze in  the background  taliesin it was the backblaze dimension  matt theyre not siphons theyre storage units  marisha you saw the cloud what did it look like  matt just pelor backing up his hard drive all right its pretty vivid for you and so as you  recount what she saw is the arrow it was darkness when she fired it as it passed through  the sphere of antimagic there was nothing and then /none/ suddenly imagery blinked through the arrow  from the perspective of it as it coasted away she looked behind and could see the twin to this orb  apparently not under the same antimagic shell on the other side whereas this side steals magic  the other side emits it as the arrow landed and clattered to the stonework maybe 20 feet below the  orb looking around she saw a landscape of blackened broken stone and ground distant  mountainscapes of jagged crags like teeth across the horizon the sky itself was black and  shadowed like it was /none/ perpetually amidst a distant forest fire and where you can see the grey in the  sky you can see roiling thunder clouds with flashes of lightning and roughly a mile or so  from what you could tell from where this was you could see what appeared to be a large obsidian  tower of twisted black stone that went up for what appeared to be a dozen or more stories  laura dont we know something about obsidian  marisha the same tower we saw in the nine hells  laura no  matt no different tower  /none/ laura this is way bigger  matt no the tower in the nine hells was the biggest thing youve ever seen towerwise this is  big but imagine a 12story obsidian tower thats pretty thin and tall  laura okay im glad i remembered that correctly because i was remembering it as a citadel and its  just a tower  taliesin this is spectacular this is great we have to let everybody know oh god we have to let  everybody know and i grab her and we bolt out  laura does it sound like anything you know /none/  taliesin no yes maybe i dont know im not sure this is a breakthrough we have a  breakthrough we have a breakthrough i am running to cassandra who im sure is asleep  matt yeah most everyones you guys have all gone to bed at this point i imagine you guys were  down there pretty late  liam well first i drag keyleth off to the cozy little bathtubs that they have here in the castle  and took the opportunity theyre quite small actually and washed all of the cakedin the last  of the cakedin /none/ blood and everything  travis because they say it its true  taliesin we have a full roman sauna underneath but thats fine whatever you need  ashley i took jb back and we built a fort in the room  matt and youve gone to bed  sam oh yeah im asleep  travis i look for a book on werewolves  matt okay make an investigation check  taliesin natural 20 natural 20  travis natural 20  cheering  taliesin its that night  matt against all odds  taliesin the trick is it requires human sacrifice /none/  marisha it is a full moon tonight isnt it or was it last night when was the full moon  matt you surprise yourself grog going wwwerewolves theres a book that talks about the  disease of lycanthropy and werecreatures and entities and its there before you and you find  its like your own little birthday party  travis i take it with me  matt okay  taliesin im calling a meeting of the council im sending out the word im telling everyone  that we have new information  sam at night  taliesin yeah im /none/ starting it now so that people who are not here can figure out their way here  marisha are you getting it over our earpieces  taliesin not them to the studying council anybody whos been studying the object im letting  everybody know as quickly as possible theres new information  matt all right so that being the case you let cassandra know cassandra goes my god all right  well let me i think i hold on she goes and rushes back to her room and she comes back with a  small looks like a river stone /none/ but has what looks to be a small rune carved into it she takes  it and holds it and goes sorry to bother you my dear but apparently percival has a breakthrough  in regards to the ziggurat and the orb as soon as you can please then takes it and puts it into a  small pouch hopefully allura received that and should be arriving soon as to eskil i dont know  how to get in touch with him hes probably well into his sleep and he gets cranky  taliesin hell find out in the morning /none/ this is good well start looking with the new data as  soon as everyone gets here this is excellent excellent good night go to sleep why are you  awake no and im out the door i run to vexs house were done  matt all right so you guys just go to bed  taliesin yeah  laura i guess so yeah but wait actually percy offsubject but when i saw keyleth i  mean she was destroyed right i mean fucking destroyed arms everywhere limbs broken just  terrible  taliesin yes  laura we put her /none/ back together like we always do but i cant get scanlan out of my mind its so  random i know but what if that happened to him and were not with him no ones there to cast  revivify  taliesin if he wanted to be found hed be found his daughters there and maybe he is possibly  smart enough to explain to her how that stone works  laura have you scryed on him again  taliesin not successfully not since i briefly found him and then i lost him but i always have  people looking /none/  laura all right i dont know why hes on my mind obviously we have much bigger things  taliesin i think maybe bigger things will help its been too quiet  laura not good at quiet  taliesin no i mean ive enjoyed it this has been great everything everything has been great  this is wonderful but i will admit i miss i dont know what i miss i miss it though i feel  like im tempting fate and im going to regret everything i say right now one day  laura i think we are who /none/ knows what this will lead to  taliesin maybe we can shut it down for good  laura yes  taliesin maybe were going to go find a small black tower somewhere filled with death and  despair  laura i dont know if im going to be able to sleep tonight  taliesin no  matt so as you find your rest for the evening the morning comes bright warm the clouds that  came in for the evening its still a cloudy sky and as you wake up the mist that usually takes up  the bottom of /none/ the valley and the forest floor is beginning to burn off as the sun begins to peek  through the clouds and show little bursts of blue above you guys head back to the castle where all  of you are everyone but keyleth well say keyleths still sleeping and taryons still  sleeping  taliesin keyleth had a bit of day  matt however allura is there waiting shes there and as you approach she goes  well isnt this a pleasant surprise  she rushes up and gives vex a big hug she comes and takes your hand /none/ as well percival  and pulls you in so cassandra told me that there was some sort of a  taliesin well vex had a brilliant idea recently you came to a very interesting power  laura yes from the exalted weapon that i got from saundor  matt oh your vestige yes  laura yes and it has the ability to shoot arrows that see  matt i recall you telling me this yes  laura right so i shot it into the orb and i saw through it  matt oh at which point you watch her whole /dung/ demeanor change and she leans in what did you see  laura fucking everything a sky and an orb and a tower an obsidian tower like twelve stories tall  matt keyleth comes down for breakfast  laura hey kiki good morning  marisha hi sorry i had weird dreams  travis that you died  liam no that really happened that actually happened yesterday  laura destroyed landscape whole other plane very dark very scary  matt another plane  laura i think i assume  taliesin this is everything as she described it this is everything i could /dung/ write down  matt as you describe down the location she goes this is certainly not a place that i know of on  this plane  marisha my dreams are on this plane  laura keyleth we had a breakthrough  matt this sounds like a location that resides somewhere in the shadowfell  laura the shadowfell  travis wait shadowfell  matt the shadowfell yes you know how you went to the feywild which is more of an overgrown  feybased nature parallel to this world yes the shadowfell is the dark shadow reflection of this  same /none/ place its a plane of negative energy and darkness a tower you said i have to go research  this some more this is good to know but i get the sense that perhaps this ritual was not as  foiled as we had initially anticipated  laura oh no  travis have you been to this shadowfell before  matt i have not been  laura does vecna reside there  matt i may go do some research  laura fuck  matt you watch her get a little thousandyard stare for a second thinking her eyes are darting /none/  around a little bit and her brain is just running and running all right well unfortunately i  cant leave until tomorrow i can only really transport myself once a day but ill immediately  make my way to vasselheim that would hopefully be able to clarify some of these questions  laura do you need company  matt no i can travel faster on my own  laura all right  matt besides i can always go ahead and bring a friend  laura how is kima  matt make a perception check actually  sam shes in /none/ the room  laura 21  matt 21 interesting one thing you do catch though subtle is as she has her hands folded on  one side you do see a small gold band across one of her fingers  sam shes hitched  laura wait a minute did you guys get married  matt it was very small very private but anyway  liam congratulations  matt thank you sorry this is conflicting emotions in this moment right now thank you  laura when did it happen  laughter  matt naught but four months ago it was on /none/ a whim we thought and discussed a lot about all the  dangers wed faced over the years together and with you and the reality of not knowing how long  either of us have on this planet i figured at the very least why not  laura i think its brilliant brilliant  matt thank you we were going to tell you theres been a lot to do in emon its looking  great by the way weve nearly completed thanks to the help of the lyceum and many of the mages  reconstruction has been rapid  laura /none/ we really should have gone there in the last year we need to visit emon  taliesin weve been very busy  laura true  matt then she covers the hand and is embarrassed  taliesin we can get you back there today if you think time is of the essence  marisha i was in emon not that long ago  taliesin why did you go to emon  marisha i had to talk to them about constructing the crisis orbs  laura oh thats true  marisha it was a lot of meetings so many damn meetings  /none/ matt if you could actually send me to the lyceum instead and from there i can go to vasselheim  but i can do my research there  marisha you want to go to the lyceum  matt yes  marisha right now  matt well its whenever you wish  marisha you want me to send you  travis im going to reset keyleths brain  marisha oh yeah through the tree  travis im going to jog her memory  marisha is there anyone else that needs to go while im doing this because this is it for /none/ the  day anyone else need to go to emon  taliesin i think were good  travis literally nobody needs to go there but her  marisha no kima  matt kimas not with her  marisha i just didnt know if she wanted to go get her  laura oh my god keyleth  liam you got a little bit of sleep stuff still in your eye  laura eye bogeys for sure  liam yeah thats better  marisha i was just asking okay lets go  matt all right so as you open the gate and /none/ allura steps through she around with a smile  thank you keyleth and  marisha i say whispering sup sun tree and then send her through  matt laughing as shes trying to talk to you shes like stutters and you just push her  through shes like whoa  marisha okay bye  matt thud and it closes  taliesin why are you awake nothing never mind  matt all right so what do you guys want to do  laura well shit well what do we do now that we know i guess we just research  taliesin /none/ this changes everything im changing the research focus in the library specifically to  things on this subject so that we can more focus  matt okay jb comes down with you and starts helping catalog and pulling out books and  information  travis ill help you go read too and i start reading my book  laura oh shit hilda did anybody go down to the bakery  sam she was going to come see us  matt yeah you havent its around noon now as all this has happened and talking with her  taliesin she was /none/ going to come to the castle  laura yeah but okay  matt tary still hasnt woken up by the way  sam im currently doty is brushing my teeth  travis brushing your teeth  matt thats not true because eventually when you go to check on his room taryon isnt there  laura and marisha what  liam sam  marisha hes not going to sam riegel us again is he because i cant handle that right now  laura where is tary did he leave a note  matt as you enter the room  sam whispers /none/ hilda ate me  laura oh my god did hilda do something  matt you can see the sheet is missing most of his personal belongings are gone doty is still  there and doty appears to be shut down nonfunctional  laura doty doty shit  matt the eyes are cold  taliesin check the book  laura what book  taliesin dotys book  laura oh i go look at dotys book  matt its within his chest compartment  taliesin i know i helped build this thing can i figure out how to get the book to /none/ eject  matt make an investigation check  laura im searching around the room looking for any sign of tary  taliesin thats so cocked thats a natural 20  matt okay not only do you find the latch but you look underneath where one of the arms is  there appears to be a small glass bead affixed with a piece of clay and the bead has this  pulsing blue light on it and you notice it there and it looks like its the only thing with any  sort of life on dotys exterior  taliesin does /none/ that look like part of doty  matt it doesnt it looks like something that was pressed onto him  laura should we take it off  taliesin is it magical  matt make an arcana check  taliesin thats a 21  matt it does appear to be magical it is giving some sort of consistent pulse of energy  laura maybe dont touch it  matt it looks fragile whatever it is the essence of the magic that you get from it the  nature of the effect at least is abjuration  laura abjuration  taliesin i /none/ genuinely dont actually know what this word means  laura i have no idea what that word means either  sam ive seen it in the players handbook  laura yeah what is it  taliesin i normally have some clue about a word  matt abjuration is one of the schools of arcane magic  laura what kind of school is it  matt laughs its the alteration and harnessing of raw arcane energy usually in some sort of  there are a number of spells that fall into the category  laura shit shit we just sent allura /none/ away fuck balls  taliesin should we call everyone lets not call everyone who should we call  laura i dont know  taliesin lets call everyone has anybody seen tary  liam hes sleeping in isnt he  taliesin hes not  ashley is he at the bakery  laura wait go check the bakery will someone go check the bakery  ashley ill check the bakery  liam where are you  laura do i see any trace of him  matt make an investigation check again  marisha castle  liam no theyre at vexs house  /none/ laura 15  taliesin can you have some coffee and come down here quickly  marisha oh my god coffee sounds amazing to me  laura keyleth  marisha yeah  taliesin yes what  laura focus  taliesin three coffees  marisha three coffees coming right up ill be right over i get three coffees and i head over  matt okay its hard to pick up a lot of details it looks like there was no struggle whatsoever it  looks like somebody entered and picked the lock to the room from the inside thats all youre able /none/  to make out from the inside of the castle  sam oh from the inside of the castle  matt yeah  laura somebody that was in the castle did this in my house  liam sam why dont you just tell us where you are  sam sure doty is brushing my teeth  laura did you end up opening the thing can you see dotys book  taliesin i popped the book out right  matt you found the compartment where you click creak it opens up and the tome is there  taliesin i have my /none/ things upstairs one second im going to get all of my tools i have  everything on me including the cloak because i want to be able to absorb any magic that comes off  of what looks like possibly a bomb just going to be careful im going to  very gently remove the book  matt you pull it out of the compartment  taliesin flip to the last written page  matt the last written page spoke of an evening of curious bakery purveyors signed on to see to  the future of goods and to create /none/ in the name of the great taryon darrington and associates and as  a sudden slumber comes over me i will find myself an evenings rest goodnight doty and that was  the final entry  taliesin im waiting for keyleth im putting the book back  laura the top sheet is gone from the bed  travis yeah because they took him away in it  laura is it an eyelash do i get a wish  ashley whispers yeah  laura wait get it so that i can make a wish  taliesin thankfully we have a scry /none/ spell or two  matt keyleth you arrive with three coffees  liam i tag along  marisha okay i have two regular one decaf no foam  laura keyleth scry on tary pike did you find anything at the bakery  matt as you hurry down to the bakery the bakery is still closed nobody was there to open it  ashley is hilda there  matt hilda is not there no  ashley i dont see anything here hildas not here  laura the bakery looks normal  ashley the bakery looks normal  matt locked and closed /none/ untouched since you left it the evening before  marisha wait you think dotys been boobytrapped  taliesin look at that that doesnt look normal  liam i want to a take a look at that and see if it looks like a trap and i dont understand  magic but if it is similar to any trigger mechanisms that ive seen  matt make a investigation check  laura keyleth come out of the room with me  liam 31  matt okay it does not appear to be a trap necessarily it looks like whatever its meant to /none/  be triggered to do has already been triggered  laura gasps somebody boobytrapped doty can you scry on taryon scry on taryon  marisha yeah what im sorry  laura hes missing  marisha what  laura hes missing somebody broke in and took him i go around and start asking no im going  to stay right here will you scry on him i need to find out what happened  marisha okay last time i tried to scry on scanlan everyone gave me  a lot of grief about it  laura okay scanlan left on his /none/ own tary didnt he left doty here there is no way this was not  foul play  liam do you think this thing is looking at us this little bead  taliesin once everyone clears out of the room i will try and remove it  marisha who is all in the room is it the four of us  laura no me and you we went outside  matt it is just vax and percy  taliesin i am going to try and remove it  liam yeah i dont think its trapped or anything you probably can /none/ do that  taliesin lets see what happens im going to use the cloak to pull it off so that im shielded from  it if anything happens  matt okay you grab it and as you pull it off its fixed and as you pull it off the bead  shatters in your hand and the blue spark fizzles out and you watch doty go tary  liam looks like the bead shut him down  matt you get the sense that the basis of this magic was a oneuse dispel  laura were not in the room youre /none/ scrying will you scry  matt you watch as doty immediately starts going tary and lifts the bed tary  marisha itd be better if i had something of tarys  matt doty leaves and charges through the room and footsteps into the hallway  laura doty doty come here  marisha hey doty  laura doty belonged to him scry with doty  marisha whats up bud  matt doty stops and looks tary  marisha okay im going to professor xavier this shit and put my hands on dotys little head come  here bend down down doty /none/ doty down doty kneel doty take a knee doty down  laura doty will you kneel down please fuck  marisha you know what its fine and im going to do the scry  matt okay  laura do you know what is happening right now  sam im getting my rogue character ready  matt keyleth your vision pulls back up into the sky above the clouds for a second you feel a  rush of wind youre not sure of the direction you feel a flash of speed and then with a blink  all of a sudden /town/ your vision is above what appears to be a small village along a road and the vision  blinks once again and youre within a hallway a wooden lowlit hallway and then the flash youre  inside of a room a wood paneling wall you see taryon unconscious and wrapped in a sheet still  in his armor propped against the shaded side of the wall while a figure stands just out of the  peripheral a familiar voice from just out of your range says its okay dear we just had a bit to  drink appreciate your concern /dung/ and you hear the door close click then a few footsteps and you  watch as in the peripheral hilda steps in next to taryon pulling the sheet from his body revealing  him tied up from head to toe hildas image shimmers slightly and dissipates revealing a  woman of inkblue skin long white hair tied into almost a topknot ponytail pale silver eyes that  inspect her handiwork under her dark green cloak that you see her hood fall back you see dark  burgundy leather armor she seems to check taryons vitals under his neck feel for /none/  breathing very methodically and begins to loosen some of his bindings in some places and you hear  her voice say cant have you losing too much circulation boy ive got a reputation to keep  she quickly tosses the blanket back over him after fixing the straps and goes sleep soundly boy  youll be home soon enough she stands up and walks across the room almost out of sight and  sits in the chair facing him you watch her rummage through her satchel pull out a cream  puff and throw it to the side of /none/ the corner pulls out a small box and begins making  something  marisha i dont know what she is making  matt make an intelligence check  sam she probably bought those cream puffs and didnt even bake them herself  travis it was ralphs cream puffs  marisha dont fuck me gil oh okay just straight intelligence  matt yeah  marisha 17  matt youve seen vex do this before it is a fletching kit she is in the process of making  arrows  marisha shes making arrows  matt shes making arrows in a casual /none/ passinghertime way and then the vision pulls  you back whoosh and youre within yourself once more  marisha gasps  laura what did you see  marisha shouting bitch fucking bitch god  laura where is he who has him  marisha shouting people wonder why we have trust issues  laura who what  marisha shouting its fucking hilda shes a vampire or a werewolf or a lich or something i  dont know dont quote me on any of this she was just like i dont want your vitals going down and  why do people take /none/ everything away from us  laura slap her across the face  marisha yelps  laura hey  marisha ow  laura okay  marisha okay  laura can you fucking calm down and tell me what you saw  liam did you see tarytown  marisha i saw tary  laura is he in trouble is he in danger  marisha yeah he looked unconscious and it was hilda and she had inkblue sparkly skin  matt not sparkly necessarily inkblue skin silver eyes  marisha inkblue skin and long silvery hair that was in a top long ponytail /none/ thing long green and  she had burgundy armor he was in a wooden room somewhere  laura is it close by  matt her ears were pointed  marisha in a hallway her ears were pointy i know a lot of people have pointy ears including  myself so im not judging anyone who has pointy ears  liam was she a drow  matt you keyleth who have not actually seen a drow elf in person really over an extended  period of time to know much about their culture but through this conversation she does appear to /none/  be yes  marisha she sounds like those things you have said before yes  laura the drow  marisha the drow yeah like us but blue skin white hair and she said she doesnt want him  losing too much of his vitality and that she was going to take him back to where he came from and  that he was special  laura gasps she was bringing him home  marisha yeah she was bringing him home  laura to his piece of shit family  marisha to his piece of shit family  laura we /none/ have to get him we have to help him  marisha but why is tary special  laura hes very rich im sure his family is just looking for him  liam yeah he is daddys boy  marisha i dont know this seems like she was interested in something other than his money  liam well its irrelevant though weve got to go get him  laura and marisha yeah  taliesin it just means we knock her unconscious as opposed to killing her when we get there it  will be fun lets do this  marisha do /tavern/ i have any idea of the hallway and the room of how far away it was  matt it felt like some sort of roadside inn thats you have no idea where  taliesin well this we can deal with a roadside inn we know were tary comes from  marisha he could be literally anywhere within a hundredmile radius  taliesin we know which roads one would take to get there from whitestone conveniently  matt from what you know the town of deastok that he comes from which is in wildmount there are no  roads that go /none/ there from whitestone because it is across the shearing channel to the other  continent which means you have to either go by boat and even then its probably a few hundred  miles away from whitestone on that side of the continent  taliesin we could do a locate object  laura yeah on his dangling earring  matt its a hundredfoot range  laura i thought it was a thousand feet range  matt sorry a thousandfoot range  laura which is still very very close  marisha or very far when jumping off a cliff  ashley /none/ what if hes still here  laura okay wait what if i use primeval awareness i cant search out a drow no fuck  can i look around to see if theres any tracks or any hint of anything that she may have dropped in  the room or anything that he might have dropped  taliesin go check hildas house as well for clues  matt searching the room you searched it once before looking over it with a second glance  there doesnt appear to be any sign of anything that she dropped the best you can tell /tavern/  especially being a tracker there doesnt appear to be any sign that either of them left the room  there was nowhere they could have gone there is no window that exits then the door was picked  and nobody saw anybody leave the room  laura she bamfed out shes got magic she could be anywhere  taliesin then why is she at an inn  laura are we sure she was at an inn  taliesin well if she is at what sounds like a waypoint and if you can travel as far as you  want /none/ why would you need a waypoint  marisha actually who is good at math oh percy youre good at math  taliesin i am good at math why what sort of math  marisha well when was the last time we saw tary  taliesin last night  marisha yeah  sam train traveling  marisha exactly a train traveling by foot  liam a tree stride spell traveling yeah  taliesin it wasnt necessary a bamf it might have just been in and out get on a horse and  head towards  liam thats a lot of ifs /none/ though  laura but she didnt leave the room  marisha she was making arrows  ashley ive made my way upstairs  matt yeah youve come back at this point now  ashley well hilda never showed up for her interview  laughter  ashley i dont think we should hire her for one where is he did you find him anything nothing  taliesin how far could they have gotten on horseback within the reasonable  matt well i mean the last you saw him its been probably 12 hours on horseback could have  gotten id say /tavern/ probably a little over 100 miles or so  taliesin 100 miles theres only so many roads that lead out of the city im pulling out a map  and im marking any roadside tavern thats within 100 miles of the city  laura doty do you know how to find tary  matt doty taryon  laura yes can you find him are you drawn to him  ashley doty  matt i know its one phrase  taliesin i cant make doty do things can i  sam you can certainly try  taliesin doty look at me /none/  matt tary  taliesin never mind  ashley doty do you know where taryon went  matt tary  ashley i feel like could you give him the book  taliesin oh yeah i gave him the book back yes  ashley could you draw something for me again  matt tary  laura try it give him the book give him some paper and a pencil  ashley do you know where taryon went can you draw it shit i thought he listened to me  sam he does  ashley he does listen to me  matt /tavern/ well the old doty did  sam and laura oh fuck  travis and you had to lose that one  ashley oh thats right doty youre new youre new doty  taliesin doty dont do that  ashley doty dont do that doty dont play that  taliesin ive got a plan i need to borrow the scrying orb im going to make a list on a map  im going to mark every roadside inn within about 200 miles  matt okay theres a number of inns in the turst fields theres a couple at the jorenn village /town/  which you are familiar with they might be just outside of the range but you put them on there as  well westruun and along the road of the silver cut  marisha what was that thing you said turns field  matt theres the turst fields  marisha and what was the other one  matt jorenn village thats where you found percy in prison  taliesin okay wheres the sun  matt right now its close to noon  taliesin well finish this and ill give it a few hours for the sun to go down so /tavern/ that i can  actually figure out what direction the inn is facing  marisha and i couldnt try and do a nature check to try and figure out what direction the wind was coming  from when it hit me during the scry  matt the wind was less of a natural wind and more of just your vision being shifted it would not  have an impact whatsoever  taliesin save the sphere ive got a plan in the meantime lets search hildas house  laura yeah okay we go and search hildas house  matt okay as /dung/ you get to hildas home you look inside its dark on the interior you knock  theres no response  laura does trinket smell we go in wait sorry check for traps right  liam 22 no 24  matt 24 it is locked but it does not appear to be trapped  liam all right its not locked anymore 32  matt okay yeah its a simple lock as you walk inside you see the candle that was lit the other  night has melted entirely and the wax is dripping off the side of the small bench  /none/ where it was laid on  liam one more in here is there any bullshit hiding around in here 29  matt 29 theres no bullshit necessarily but there is that pile of linens in the corner you  see it shifting slightly and as you pull off the side you see there bound hilda shes like  muffled noises  liam all right whisper out and i cut her free  matt oh  liam you all right  matt im all right  liam what happened  matt stuttering naught but a few days ago this blueskinned woman /town/ came and she seemed nice  enough and she asked me questions she didnt hurt me or nothing  she just asked a lot of questions  liam and youve met us before no  matt no ive seen you around town people talk about you saying what youve  done for the people  ashley do you bake cream puffs  matt i have before yeah  laura do you want to work in a bakery just kidding we were in the middle of something well  talk to you later  laughter  laura wait does trinket smell /none/ anything having to do with can he smell a different smell can he  smell the evil hilda  matt make a perception check with advantage for trinket  liam thats good thats also pretty good  laura perception that is 24  matt okay trinket goes sniffing grunting and picks up what appears to be some sort of a scent  laura yeah where did it go  matt not really a bloodhoundstyle scent but a decent scent guiding him around over the next  hour or so and trying to go in the areas you know he might /none/ have been the last strong scent is in  taryons room and theres no trail from there  laura motherfucker this is terrible i feel like we did this to him  taliesin were going to get him back now  laura hes just so vulnerable  taliesin right do i have enough of an angle on the sun now where this should be doable  matt to  taliesin figure out which way is north south east and west if i try and scry on tary  matt sure yeah you gauge the sun in the sky  taliesin /none/ all right kiki lets do this  marisha am i helping you are we doing this together  taliesin well youre giving me the orb since you have the orb  marisha im giving you the orb  taliesin and im going to give it back to you when im done  marisha yeah i feel like you did this before  taliesin i did  marisha successfully  taliesin yes  marisha i underestimated you do you need my help  taliesin sure  marisha okay  matt all right  taliesin im going to try and glean as /none/ much information about the nature of the landscape  around the person that im focusing on as humanly possible  matt okay  marisha and im going to try and figure out a discerned direction  taliesin help with type of plants whether or not its getting south east west not north most  probably south  matt okay so before you do that you take the orb and sit down and concentrate and keyleth aids  you in setting up this small ritual as you close your eyes and focus on taryon once more your vision shifts  and /none/ seem to be jettisoned across hundreds of miles within a second no direction at the moment its  too much of a blur of color and light and movement until it comes to a halt and there you see  taryon somewhat jostled by the spell kicking in and the momentum you see him thrown over what  appears to be the back of a horse just hoofbeats  taliesin which way is the shadow of the horse  matt taryon you come to consciousness ever so slightly and looking down you see hooves  clattering on the ground behind /none/ you you glance around percival i want you to go ahead and make  a nature check  laura come on theyre going to wildmount  taliesin this is not my strong suit thatll do though 22  matt 22 the skies here grow gray with clouds as the mountain spirepeppered landscape is broken up  by farreaching forests and rivertraced glades the air appears cold as the winter here seems to  cling to the countryside for a majority of the year a mixture of gloom and beauty as unique as it is  impressive thats about as much /none/ as you can glean from this standpoint its very blurred on the  outskirts it seems similar to a harsher whitestone landscape this is definitely further  east looking at placement of the sun in the sky its further to the west  taliesin theyve gone east theyre still on the northern end of the continent if theyre on the  continent at all  matt no any further north from here and theyd be in the water for the time theyve traveled  theyre east on wildmount somewhere you can gather  taliesin east on wildmount is there any /none/ other sign can i see a tree  matt unfortunately the scrying location the actual orb that you see from is very limited in  scope the fact that youre able to even make out the details that i told you are because youre  seeing color and images and shapes in the distance you get a vague idea of landscape but  its all very blurred  taliesin is it giving me any sense of anywhere ive been before  matt you have not really traveled length and breadth of anywhere outside of taldorei so no  what you /none/ do see though is on the front of the horse you see the same cloaked figure riding the  horse glances back over the shoulder and you can see what appears to be a paleskinned human woman  looks in her twenties or so but same outfit and looks back and checks on him hes stirring a  little bit and she glances back and goes be patient were almost there hoofbeats  taliesin thatll do  marisha am i with him in the vision  matt no youre watching him as his eyes glaze over for a moment  /none/ taliesin well thatll do  laura where is he  taliesin theyre taking him home  laura well yes we knew that  taliesin theyre on horseback theyre already quite far i dont know precisely where they  are but if we can make our way to  laura wildmount  liam yeah whats our fastest method there  taliesin theyre going by horse theyll probably be there sooner rather than later  would be my guess  laura you dont know where any trees are in wildmount  marisha the closest tree that weve ever been to was the /none/ one we used to get to draconia but i  dont know how close draconia is to him i can try and scry on where they are and look and see for  the biggest tree myself and pop out right there  taliesin well the city that tarys from  matt deastok  taliesin it would be best to go there and cut them off we know that theyre coming from the  west theres got to be a way to get there  marisha can i scry on deastok  matt you can only scry on locations that /none/ youve seen or been to  marisha and people that i have connections to  matt people you can scry on with certain levels of knowing them or hearing about them and such  taliesin how far is it  matt ill doublecheck real fast because i dont want to get a lot of anger on the internet  instead of targeting a creature you can choose a location you have seen before  as the target of the spell  marisha instead of choosing a creature but i could try and scry on tary again  and get a /none/ nearby tree  matt its only a tenfoot radius to see anything clearly around the center so youd have to be  pretty close to a tree for you to make it out enough  marisha do we have any images or any books here on deastok that i can look at and then try and  scry on and then after i have the knowledge  laura dotys book he might have written some things about it  liam gilmores been many places he might have something from there  taliesin how far away is it how far away /none/ is the city from us how many days on horseback  matt lets see from whitestone directly it would be probably about you cant cross the  channel on horseback but if you were to start at the other side of the shearing channel on  horseback and ride lets say 12 hours a day you could probably get there in about four days three  to four days  taliesin so if we misted  marisha it still wouldnt be enough time  laura no just bamf there  marisha we have to bamf there  liam two days /none/ go to emon talk to shaun hes been everywhere  laura scry on her again  taliesin draconia how close would draconia be to this  marisha yeah do we know how close draconia is  matt the dremoth ravine with the remains of draconia would probably be about 150 200 miles  from it  taliesin thats not bad we could misty from draconia  marisha yes we could  laura sure  taliesin but you cant tree stride today can you  laura oh you already used it on allura  marisha is that the same day i /none/ thought we slept  taliesin no that was the same day  matt well you used it once today you had a full nights sleep got all your spells back and then  you sent allura off once today  laura so we have two  marisha so that was today i could do it again and then i can misty step us and then i would be  out of my 6th 7th and 8thlevel spells i would be burning higher spell slots to get us there but  i could do it  taliesin we could be there /none/ we could be there in hours if need be  laura lets do it  marisha you have no books here on deastok none in whitestone  laura lets look in the doty book real fast  marisha yeah  matt okay theres a lot of writing in here  laura towards the beginning  matt towards the beginning it

transported which lets go ahead and take a moment here actually taryon as  youve come to consciousness on the back of this horse and you hear this woman cloaked and riding  in front of you tell you were almost there and then hoofbeats youre hopping around on the  back bound you try and move your arms and legs and theyre tied tightly  sam doty doty im having a dream again doty oh boy ugh hello

horse riding  sam damn it sighs money is so good not when you dont have it i have armor i have jewels  that are worth a lot please you dont want to do this please  just let it go and no one will get

my apologies hoofbeats and goes right back  sam i respect her so much sighs  travis mouthing whats her name  sam i dont ask people names friend laughs  matt all right so what are the rest of you guys doing  laura running around like crazy people  marisha we bamfed through the tree right  matt right yep so /none/ you gathered your elements and you transport through one of the trees that  you created on the outside of the dremoth ravine  marisha thats right we grew them a forest  matt you did  marisha oh my god thats right  liam the last time we came here we came flying out of a tree on an angle  matt on an angle yeah you do not come through that same tree  marisha off the edge of a cliff laughs nervously its a theme  matt sorry  laura all right so which way is wildmount /town/  taliesin northeast  matt from this area it would be northeast yes  laura lets go  taliesin so i say we head north first find the main road  matt youre on wildmount the continent but youre heading more towards the city of deastok  which is on the outskirts of the dwendalian empire  taliesin we did know that they were on a road headed west heading east which means if we head  north and then the minute that we hit that main road start heading in that direction we might  even pass them on /none/ the way and be able to identify a horse  laura especially if were in like fart form  matt all right so you guys are going into your wind walk form  liam before we do percy do you know anything about this country were in anything  matt make a history check  taliesin not really my area of expertise but 22 history check correct  matt yes  taliesin 22  matt this area of wildmount known as wynandir is divided into two different kingdoms essentially  this one youre going towards is called the dwendalian empire /none/ this is the strongest and the  most functional empire this side of exandria it is a tyranny there is a king and the law is  ruled absolutely through this king it is a functional economy its people arent mistreated  from what youve read though it is i want to say its very prussian people work people live  people die  laura harsh  matt its a harsh environment its a colder environment whereas the center of taldorei is a  lot of fields and rolling hills across the midsection framed by mountains across wildmount  it /none/ is a smattering of mountain ranges and spires throughout and chunks of forest it is a much  harsher environment as far as the topography and the biomes than taldorei and as such the  pockets where people do live they live as well as they can amongst a very oppressive environment  taliesin whats the name of the city one more time  matt deastok  marisha oh this is deastok okay  taliesin deastok so its a bit prussian  matt yeah  taliesin okay that will do so dont expect a lot of hospitality and lets just /town/ have our  business get it done and get out  liam also we cant talk when were farts so when we get there whats the plan plan man  taliesin were going to fly up until we see the main road we see the main road were going to  take it towards the city were going to stay a bit high if anyone spots a lone horse and a rider  with a humansized package on the back were going to do a little spinaround spinaround  spinaround and were all going to park ourselves maybe a quarter /town/ of a mile up the road  ashley i like that idea  liam what happens if we dont see the person on the horse what happens we just land right  outside the gates and ring the bell  taliesin we land inside the gates  liam okay but that seems a little dicey if we want to work out what were going to do were  just going to appear and say howdy  taliesin from what i know of this city its not a locked city is it  matt its not a locked city there are /none/ perimeter walls and there are gates that can close in case  of times of war you do know that there is a strong military presence in most cities and there  are patrols that often make sure that peace is kept  taliesin so we can walk in if we need to but lets not make any waves unless we need to  matt its a somewhat militaristic nation its to the point where you dont know or at least  have not heard of any widespread abuses of power at least not on the outskirt cities you dont /none/  know that much about the political structure there other than the fact that it is a tyranny  but it has a strong standing military and they do exercise it in times of peace as a form of law  enforcement  liam you and tary are thick as thieves now how plugged in is his dad  laura super right i mean hes not the most powerful guy but he does well for himself he  runs an area  matt the way taryon talks about his father is he is a land baron in deastok he owns /none/ a number of  plots and homes and farms and collects taxes on them his family has been doing this for at least  a generation or two and has made quite a fortune off of it  laura and his sisters name is  matt his sisters name is maryanne  laura maryanne thats creative okay all right  liam yes maryanne darrington  laura and his mom is mariya laughs all right  travis mariya and howaardt  laura mariya and howaardt darrington  matt yes  liam all right  laura see i know his mothers name /none/  matt all right do you go ahead and accept keyleths wind walk all right with a moment of  concentration you all convert yourselves into plumes of smoke mist by the way did you leave  doty behind or take doty with you  marisha we cant take him with us  matt yeah okay then doty is back in whitestone  laura i mean yeah he doesnt respond to us  marisha i mean we would have had to have had  travis just say no  marisha no we didnt  matt i was just reconfirming all /none/ right then so you guys convert to your  laura i cant put him in the necklace he wont go in the necklace i tried before  he doesnt go  liam who are you talking to  matt you all coast in the shapes of mist into the moist freezing air over the dremoth ravine and  head northward you guys move as a cluster of small plumes of moisture as you look forward over  the next 300 feet a round at double speed  laura carry the three  matt yeah  taliesin doing air math its /none/ great nothing quite like air math  matt once again this is twice in an episode where its magicalfantasyrealm physics  somewhere in the middle you find a fun narrative id say within probably an hour and a half to two  hours of travel because you guys are going pretty fast you eventually come upon a very wellridden  and apparent pathway that goes from east to west the topography does seem at least to be somewhat  in line with what you saw the brief time that you scryed upon taryon  taliesin im just heading the direction /none/  laura that smoke plume definitely  ashley that smoke plume knows where its going  taliesin i cant hear you  matt so you guys all continue heading east  laura do we have normal mental thoughts when were smoke plumes or do we just think in terms  of wind noises  matt no you think normally youre still mentally you you just cant talk if you do talk  it comes out as blows raspberry  liam blows raspberry  matt there you go  laura what does it sound like if you laugh  liam and /town/ taliesin airy laughter  laura sorry were going  matt as you guys continue pushing east  taliesin im going to be keeping an eye out for anybody on the road  laura ditto  matt perception check from the two of you guys  taliesin 12  laura 22  matt okay you see what looks to be one small caravan a series of carts that are heading west  along the path thats the only thing that you see at the moment you vex after a couple more hours  of travel in an eastern direction you see /none/ what looks to be a big thick forest the forest itself  is pretty dense in this area and there are pockets where its open and you get a little more  of a green field youve been traveling over a larger green field area so you start hitting  where the forest gets thicker and thicker the pathway carves through this forest then a ways  ahead you see what appears to be a large hill that rises up and then around the hill the  forest has been cleared and you can see what amounts to acres and /town/ acres and acres of farmland  that circles almost like a disk around this large central hill the top of the hill is cleared off  and there you can see what appears to be a metropolitan city a large town if you will you  can see what appear to be actually no youre not quite close enough so thats what you see  you see this village on top of this cleared hill surrounded by farmland and then surrounded by  forest and what appear to be some broken mountain ranges maybe a few miles out each direction /town/  taliesin i keep skirting around looking for a lone horseman  matt okay  laura can i fly down and see if i see any signs along the road  any markers saying what city it is  matt okay you cruise down and begin riding a little closer to the surface with your general  even passive perception you do catch what appears to be there are a few splinter trails that seem  to be the perimeter on the outside of where the forest leads inward and heads along the outskirts  of the tree line there /town/ you do see a sign the arrow leads forward towards what is called the  siren green forest and then eastward towards deastok you gather that the large town on this  carved hilltop seems to be the town in question  laura but nobody on horseback  matt you dont see anybody on horseback at the moment no  taliesin hiccups  travis laughing is that the cloud hiccups  taliesin im going to scout around a little closer to the ground and see if theres anybody  maybe any of the paths off the main road where someone /none/ might be hiding and just run through the  trees looking for anything im searching around a little bit i know were close to the city and  im keeping an aerial view because we should be able to see an awful lot from high up  matt you do you see hundreds of acres of farmland that surround this large hill its built  all across the top of the hill then built along the front side of it you can see a number of  paths that zigzag down elements of it sprawl a bit into the farm /town/ but the majority of the  metropolis is on top of the hill itself and then the farmland around it you do see as you get  closer and skirt the sides there are patrols you see men on horseback with crossbows slung over the  side that do perimeters some of them are weaving independently through the fields keeping an eye  on people who are in the process of harvesting  taliesin no interest of getting anywhere near that  matt the rest of you guys continue heading east towards the town or are you following  taliesin /town/ im popping back on the road  matt okay percival catches up to you guys  laura at this point i feel like our option is only to go towards the house if we can find his  familys keep  travis did we beat him here  laura i dont know theres no way to know  taliesin we can land and have a conversation  laura yeah  matt okay so you guys whoosh make your way to the where do you want to land  laura maybe the edge of town into the siren gate forest  /none/ matt okay so you find the edge of the tree line before it opens up into the farmland surrounding  the city as you all take a moment to concentrate your forms congeal once more into your physical  selves and you are able to discuss as you prefer  laura well anybody see anything  ashley is it possible she couldve put some kind of covering over them  laura like we did with whitestone or something  ashley yeah  taliesin yes  liam many things are possible though  marisha can we still see their tracks if /town/ we went back and looked that would be a ranger question  laura i mean its just horse tracks but i can look horse tracks on a main road unless tary is  thinking and hes leaving something behind so that we can track him  taliesin tary can you hear us  laura tary good idea percy  matt nothing at the moment  liam have to be within 500 feet  marisha i could try commune with nature but it only extends for a few miles  laura im going to cast locate oh should i do that /none/ should i waste it right now  marisha how long does it last  laura ten minutes im going to try wait a thousand feet thats not very far compared to  where the city is  travis a few miles is better  marisha plus thats a concentration spell the mist form is my concentration spell so we should  be able to do both at once correct if we move quickly while she has her locate object on  matt yeah  laura okay lets do that  taliesin all right  laura im going to try to /none/ locate his dangly earring  ashley dangly bits  taliesin his dangly bit  laura his penis  ashley travis and marisha penis  taliesin his tary  marisha giggling his tary  liam going down to tarytown  sam matts doing something  laura i know its something  matt okay i was making sure the wind walk wouldnt affect any concentrations  travis hes doing trigonometry  taliesin squaring his hypotenuse  matt and youre attempting locate object on taryons earring you said  laura yes  matt okay  taliesin his dangly bit  matt you focus /none/ and concentrate it does not pick up within a thousand feet of you  laura okay so were going to misty form towards the city and see if we can  taliesin yeah  matt okay whoosh you all head back up into the sky and you can see now the clouds in this  vicinity are growing darker it looks like its probably going to rain  in the next few hours or so  laura okay so were less noticeable  matt the temperature right now means it might even sleet youre not sure you make your way /none/  coasting over the farmland looking down you can see its all segmented and all marked off with  various colored fences everything is really wellorganized here and all the land has been  divided you eventually make your way towards the base of the hill and cruise up to the outskirts of  the city where you see the large stone walls that encircle elements of the outskirts and you see  where each one of these walls opens up to some sort of a pathway there is a large metallic gate  that is currently separated and lifted /none/ up in the back that can be slammed and closed and shut in  case you need to keep anybody in or out  laura ping  matt youre getting no ping yet  laura no pings okay  matt you guys are now over the wall now these six plumes of mist coasting above  what do you do  marisha do we backtrack  laura were over his familys keep  matt you dont know what his familys keep looks like  marisha but were over the city  matt youre over the city right now yeah  /none/ marisha so we theoretically havent intercepted them yet  matt no  taliesin im going to try and motion everyone to follow me in a circle around the city and then  back out the front gate  laura okay  matt okay you move pretty fast its a big radius to go around the entire wall perimeter of  the city at your full speed id say you can do a full pass in about 15 minutes or so thats a  careful cruising through nothing seems to ping  laura i think we beat him maybe we beat /town/ him  sam oh matt i forgot to tell you when i left home i left a large eternal flame burning on my  keeps roof is that okay  matt oh right good to clarify no all right so  taliesin i dont know maybe we beat her im going to try and motion everyone  laura back out to the fucking woods  taliesin just a little not far  matt back out to the woods okay  taliesin back onto the road and off the road so that were not super visible  matt so youre heading /town/ back over the farmland back to the outskirts of the siren gate forest  into the tree line  taliesin about an hours walk to the city is where i want to put us  liam to where we can see the city and see the road coming to it  matt all right cool so you guys find your way there you wait for a moment to make sure the  patrols arent anywhere nearby and you turn back into your physical selves  taliesin well weve either beat them here or shes really clever  laura or she /town/ took off all of his clothing and hes riding around naked  marisha but she would still theoretically have his clothing it would still exist  laura yeah hopefully  liam what do you think you think we should camp out here for a while and keep an eye on the road  for a day or two see if we can intercept and if they never show up then we need to figure out  going into the city  taliesin do we have a way of scrying one more time before the day is up  marisha i /none/ do  laura okay then lets scry one more time and see if we beat them  marisha i can do one of two things i can either scry on them or i can do a  commune with nature spell  laura scry  marisha all right scry  matt all right your vision shifts once more to taryon who uncomfortably like ow ow ow on  the back of this horse a little bit and as you start audibly making a pained sound a hand grabs  the back of where the ropes are entwined and shifts you /town/ in the back of the seat to be a little  more comfortable  sam oh thank you  matt no response from her still riding on the back of the horse its getting darker now and you can  see the clouds are still a little pushing towards that stormy look that you saw when you were in the  city so theyre still on the road theyre still traveling  taliesin but its the road that weve  matt seems familiar  marisha is the sun in the same direction that were heading  matt yes the suns /town/ more westward at this point  marisha okay  taliesin so we could in theory mist low to the ground on this road in that direction and in  theory catch up with them  marisha and hes conscious which is good hes still alive  laura and he has his clothing on  marisha yeah  laura good thats good  marisha we wont see his dangling bits  taliesin just the one  marisha just the one  ashley should we mist that way  taliesin i say we mist that way  liam and intercept him  /dung/ ashley i like that idea  laura yeah lets intercept them  matt okay so you guys go back into mist form whoosh and begin coasting westward along the  path you travel for about ten minutes before vex and vax you pick up what looks to be a small dark  shape on the road  liam and laura whoosh  matt okay so what do you do  laura were trying to signal everyone  liam is there forest on the sides of the road from where we are  matt no you traveled away from the forest /none/ now youre in open fields  liam so open fields and roads shite okay  laura oh but wait turn back into wait  matt you cant talk  laura i turn back into a thing  matt so you go and land vex lands and takes a minute to concentrate and  go back to her physical form  laura theyre up ahead maybe we should just bamf here be solid i can disguise the landscape and  we can ambush her  taliesin all right  laura so i do that  travis should we set a fallback /town/  marisha you guys does this make us highway bandits are we highway bandits  laura as shes saying that i start using  matt you have about a minute until she gets to you right now by the way youre able to see the  horse traveling a little above the road so theyre almost upon you  laura oh god what do we do she knows all of us  taliesin im going to start making my way a decent distance and running a little bit off the  road im going to try and find some cover /town/ and get ready to injure a horse  laura who wants to stand in the middle of the road  liam and whats on the sides of the road is it tall grass bald  matt its maybe kneehigh grass with sections of bald the landscape here outside of the farmland  and the forest that you can see looks a little hard and badlandsish scrubland  travis im going to go 200 300 yards back towards the city just in case  they manage to get through  matt okay so youre getting down youre doing that  liam /town/ im going to get into some grass as close to the road as i can  laura i bamf trinket out and we get in the grass and stealth  matt okay roll a stealth check disadvantage for trinket  laura i cast pass without a trace  marisha oh cool  laura natural 20  matt nice and for trinket with disadvantage because hes a big bear  liam oh thats a good one  laura oh he got a 19 which is a crit for him that sucks 19  matt well its not a crit thats only /town/ on attacks  laura oh well still  ashley its a critical stealth  matt all righty  laura plus ten  marisha oh wait did you want someone in the middle of the road  ashley ill stand in the middle of the road  travis unassuming  marisha unassuming okay im going to go into crow form caws  ashley maybe i can act like im an old woman trying to cross the road  matt so you go into crow form  marisha im going to aid to her bird lady aesthetic  matt stealth roll percy /none/  taliesin stealth roll  matt and stealth roll for you too vax  liam 37  travis do drows have magic sight or anything  laura i dont know  liam its a reliable talent in fact  taliesin stealth roll is oh thats not bad 21  laura plus ten  taliesin plus ten 31  matt okay grogs a ways back  travis not stealthing  taliesin and im getting down im preparing for the shot  laura ditto  ashley im going to pull up my cloak and slowly start crossing  taliesin im also going /town/ to activate the secondary mechanism in the diplomacy glove  matt okay  marisha i follow pike and peck at her bread crumbs as she crosses the road  matt okay all right so as this is happening and this is a really fast rush over rush over  get into places and you watch as the horse has galloped hoofbeats you have pike in the middle  of the road dressed the same in memory  travis i have to pee its like hide and go seek the waiting  matt and you watch as the horse hoofbeats goes /town/ off the path and begins to make a wide circle  laura motherfucker shes going around us  matt seemingly yeah  ashley excuse me maam  matt full gallop burst  marisha i take off in crow form  taliesin i was actually going to the second she started to leave the road i take a shot  matt at  taliesin at the horses legs  matt all right  laura well heal it  matt go ahead and make an attack with disadvantage  taliesin disadvantage  matt because youre aiming specifically for the legs  taliesin /none/ can i burn a grit for it  matt oh you do technically have an actual yeah so you will not have disadvantage on this  taliesin ill burn a grit for this this is worth a grit  liam horse killing is a feat you took right  marisha were gods remember  travis yeah remember that  taliesin thats not great but its not bad 20  matt 20 will hit so whats the effect on that one again  taliesin thats a strength saving throw or prone  matt whats the dc  taliesin 20  matt /none/ so you watch no gunshot complete silence as you all begin to maneuver you watch as the  horse suddenly neighs and goes ass over tea kettle forward jettisoning both taryon and the  rider from the horse into a neat roll since you have not moved tary you make a full spill  skittering across the ground  sam screams  matt you suffer ten points of bludgeoning damage  travis what about the horse does he fall off  matt no the horse is prone and still takes damage from the shot so roll damage  taliesin oh /none/ and also takes damage  matt because you shot it with  taliesin i did i really shot it it didnt have a good day do i have enough  laura well heal it so good  travis im going to eat it  taliesin theres no horse left yeah oh boy thats 30 points of damage  matt 30 points of damage  laura is that a lot for a horse  taliesin thats my maximum damage with a single unaffected shot  matt yeah as the horse skids over and hits the ground it falls onto its side /none/ and you watch its  heavy breathing become still  laura and ashley no  travis dinner  taliesin im keeping a second shot the second i see her head i am taking a  head shot on this girl  matt okay make a perception check because you were down in the grass  taliesin nope  sam i lift my head up whats going on  matt you cant because you are tied  taliesin 11  matt no you see nothing what were you doing  liam whoosh  matt okay so you whoosh up in the /none/ air okay  laura im brooming  matt youre brooming towards all right so she comes to a tumble for this purpose im going to  have you two since youre both pretty quick roll initiative checks please  laura 26  liam 24  matt jesus okay so you both rush over and you watch as she tumbles and catches herself skidding  into the dirt you can see bits where shes rubbed and gashed in the face pale skin blonde hair  nowhere near the description that you were given by those who were trying to scry earlier /none/ but  catches herself and lands reaches over and sees taryon about three feet behind and immediately  darts over grabbing something from the satchel  laura can i shoot her with an arrow  matt it wouldve taken your movement to get to her but you can move half as quickly and go for a  shot if you want to  laura i want to try to go for a shot  liam how close are we right in this second  matt well youre going to close the distance because youre apparently a bullet learn to  /none/ balance your magical items people  liam or not  matt or not  laura or let your players spread them out and not keep them all for themselves  matt exactly yeah  liam salt salt  matt its all good so youll be able to get your shots off about the time that you get there  laura salty oh no  liam you got a four because of all that salt  laura yeah i know that was 19  matt that hits  laura the first and then more than that on the second  matt /none/ okay so both hit go ahead and roll damage  laura oh is it too late to say i want one to be a bramble shot  matt you can bramble shot sure  laura yeah okay  matt you decide a bramble shot as you hit  laura oh sweet dc of 17  matt dc of 17 not with an eight  laura shes restrained  matt shes restrained  travis nice thats huge  laura 12 13  sam pretty calm fight music matt  matt the volume is really low on that speaker my apologies  /none/ laura 13 plus eight is 21  matt there we go  laura 21 plus eight is 29 plus 1d6 lightning damage 29 plus six is 35 35 on the first shot  matt all righty  laura and then 16 24 on the second and i was wrong add two more to the first shot because i  forgot i was using my bracers  matt okay so 37 got it so you flying arrows and fire both off as your broom is coasting inward  from an arc and the first arrow catches her in the knee and /none/ she yelps and is still reaching for  taryon however as the arrow smashes into her it bursts into a series of thorny vines that whoosh  wrap around and ensnare her and she falls over now bound like taryon is for the moment falls on  the ground whatever was in her hand stumbles forward  laura and travis yeah  matt and shes like grunts reaching out just as the second arrow hits her in the back and groans  gives out a yelp in pain vax  liam what distance am i right now would you say /none/  matt you almost closed the distance with your movement  travis get in there barry allen  liam okay but am i within 50 feet 60 feet  matt youre within 60 feet  liam 60 feet all right so im going to throw whisper at her and shes brambled  matt shes restrained you have advantage  liam right yeah that hits thats a 32 im going to bamf there on this one right up to her  that is four plus eight is 12 plus this guy makes it 19 plus these guys now we do some /none/ more math  20 26 27 31 34 39 42 with whisper right into her back and then click the boots of haste  and then im going to scuttle to tary and cut ropes hes probably within ten feet right  matt yeah hes like five feet from her  liam all right so im cutting him totally loose and im going to lift him away whatever youll  let me do action action bonus action right and movement to get there  matt well no your movement was to get there your action was to attack her and /none/ so you have  your bonus action still  liam then ill use it to cut him loose  matt okay you begin to cut him loose because theres a lot of ropes around him theres not a  single binding  liam okay good enough  matt all right so now its her turn shes bound on the ground coughs up blood as shes suffered a  severe amount of damage in just a few moments as shes lying there on the ground the vines  twisting around her she goes wait wait sighs stop and shes going to /town/  whats the dc  laura 17  matt 17 she does manage to break free from the restraints she breaks free from the vines and  then she puts her hands up thats her turn  laura can i land  matt yeah if anyone else wants to take any of their actions right now were technically not in  initiative order shes put her hands up  taliesin im slowly making my way a little closer to the action but im going to find a place where  i can watch both sides of the road and also /town/ whats happening off the road right now  matt okay  travis im writing my name in the path with a stick  laura im grabbing the thing that she was trying to grab  marisha same as percy but as a crow  taliesin actually if you come well that would be interesting actually  marisha caws  matt what you find on the ground is a small marble similar in size to the one that you saw  attached to the side of doty earlier but its a different color the one that you saw earlier was  /none/ a bluish tint a light blue tint this one appears clear  laura can i pick it up ill pocket that shit  matt okay  sam can i stand up yet am i still tied up  matt at the moment as all of you begin to converge and close in on her she just has her  hands up at this point id say for the next minute or so you get cut free yeah you still  have your armor on you still have all your equipment that was on you yeah she took  everything with /none/ you youre not robbed you were just bound and taken  liam you all right t  sam i will yeah panting what took you people so long i was on a horse  for what felt like days

a solo agent  sam so cool  laura can i insight check her  matt go for it  laura shes so cool 17  matt 17 shes hard to read by nature and by business you get the sense and at this point as  youre looking at her she sees you glaring and looking /none/ over her intensely she sighs takes one  hand up under her hood and presses her thumb to the side of what looks like a small circlet and  her image shimmers and you now see before you the drow elf that was described to you wincing as the  sun is still in the sky and you can see while the illusion did not seem to give off that shes  physically not enjoying being under direct sunlight  liam bet youre glad for that cloud cover today arent you  matt its been helpful thats why i prefer /none/ to do most of my work in wildmount  liam what should we do here  sam well we should bind her and search her make sure shes not holding any weapons or anything  travis you were just supposed to bring tary back to his dad  matt that is all unharmed i took great care to make sure he was not harmed i have a business i  run based purely on reputation  sam i respect that but i did get a bruise right here from the horse falling over so im

broken i do not get paid and it is a blight on future business  travis are you armed somebody remove her weapons so she can put her arms down  matt you pat her down yeah she has two daggers one placed in each boot stealthily hidden she  has a shortbow that is over her chest and shoulder and a side quiver of about 40 arrows  laura oh shit these are good arrows  matt /none/ she goes thank you  laura

belongings and send her on her way  travis you dont want to see her dead  sam thats a separate question isnt it  travis yep  sam were very close proximity i mean seems foolish not to at least go have it out with him /none/  this is unacceptable behavior i think in any relationship this is not cool right  laura no he should have offered way more money for you  sam well yes theres that too  travis she did surrender im just thinking maybe we go in she gets paid she keeps her  reputation and then you can  sam you want her to get paid she kidnapped me  ashley you should still make your dad pay though  sam what  ashley you could say i wouldve come here  sam she committed a crime against me i /none/ dont want her to get money  matt as youre having this conversation she slowly puts her hands down  liam im still watching  travis and she surrendered right  sam im sorry i guess i was raised with a different appreciation for money but pike your  family came in and robbed us and you gave them a bunch of gold then this person kidnapped me and  you want to give her 5000 gold  laura well we dont want to give her 5000 gold we want your dad to have to give her 5000 gold  /none/ ashley and if you show up with all of us and her say you couldve just called i wouldve shown up  but you still have to pay her  sam you think hell be guilted  ashley well i dont know i dont know him  taliesin i

live and  get you paid and you keep your reputation all on the same day  /none/ matt to be perfectly honest this is an offer i very well cannot refuse given the circumstances  if you are serious  laura we are we want you to find someone  matt then find them i will  sam i abstain with an attitude  travis noted all in favor of getting her paid letting her live and earning a favor  ashley well hold on tary if you had it your way what would you want  travis what are you doing  ashley majority rules but lets hear what you have to say  sam i /none/ would like an apology  taliesin i think thats fair  laura and ashley thats fair  matt her eyes become these narrow slits and the jaw clenches i apologize for any discomfort or  embarrassment my retrieval of you may have caused  laura thats a good apology  sam and as to the amount that was promised do you think that was a fair amount  travis oh this is a bit much  matt it was my standard rate  sam i accept your apology and as i said i admire your diligence and faith to your /none/ contract  you dont get any of your belongings back is that all right  all negative noises  laura she might need it  sam you dont get any of your magical belongings back i want it  laura well i want you to look at them i want to know what it is  sam yeah but well i guess walk in together and you can present me to my father this seems so  stupid but

life looking for him think about it  laura he could be dead  liam hes doing what he wants to do  ashley did i overhear them  matt make a perception check /none/  ashley 16  matt how quiet were you guys being  taliesin pretty quiet  matt you glean elements of the conversation  liam i wasnt trying to hide it  matt yeah you get the gist of what they were talking about  ashley okay she doesnt have to bring him or anything it could be just looking bring us  information if she sees him  travis like a twoday report  ashley we dont have to we dont have to do it but i do like the idea of this woman this woman  had a /none/ job to do its not her fault im sorry tary but i do feel like we need to let her  complete her mission  taliesin its a bit her fault  sam fine and then we can send her to look after that little creep that youre always talking  about  liam when you were in vasselheim  laura it was a cube tary like a cube  sam thats gross thats disgusting  liam how would you feel if you learned that wed sent someone to watch you he left he wanted to  go he wanted /none/ to be away from us  ashley i know  liam if he wants to come back i want him back  ashley i know but i feel like he shouldve come back already  laura what if hes dead  ashley what if hes dead  liam what if hes being a father to his child what if hes enjoying his life  travis boring  ashley if thats the case then maybe she can tell us that and then well leave it alone but  what if hes dead  taliesin why doesnt she just owe us one /none/ favor to be claimed later  ashley yes i like that idea  marisha i fly down to pikes shoulder and i go caws  laura yeah i know right  ashley see she thinks i like that idea she owes us a favor at some point  travis but i want to find scanlan  ashley maybe we should table it  sam yeah lets go talk to my dad and get this settled and then well figure out your next  assignment or whatever  laura youll hang out though youre not going to disappear  matt i /none/ have business

her horse i assume well be walking very well and her image shimmers  once more to the paleskinned blonde woman in the same outfit and you all walk along with her  through the forest down the path through the farm fields making your way to the outskirts of  deastok /none/ as you are making your way up the hillside path one of the patrol guards comes down  on horseback crossbow slung over his shoulder and his hand on the side of his sword as he glances  down and goes hail you there and as soon as he glances over the group of you  mister darrington welcome home  sam thank you these are my friends they should be treated with respect  matt of course good day  travis and taliesin bidet  matt he continues clomping by hoofbeats making his way down the rest of his /dung/ patrol  taliesin its going to be a dark window isnt it this entire trip  sam no the town was never the problem its a fine place to grow up  taliesin im very curious lets see this place  sam sure  marisha ill go ahead and drop form so im not a bird  taliesin ow oh god  marisha oh i always forget that im so sorry  taliesin thats all right its not my shooting arm  marisha im learning still  taliesin i know  marisha sorry

point  sam and now were so close here lets go to my dads house but /none/ i need to make an entrance  ill be on broom  laura can i be on broom too though  sam yes behind me and i should be front and center you guys can flank  laura flying v behind you  sam yes thank you  marisha i catch up to tary a little bit and i go hey are you special in some way is there  something about you thats magical and special  sam is this a trick question theres everything most things are special about me  marisha thats true is there a reason /none/ a vampire would want you  sam what theres vampires here  marisha do you have special blood  sam no wait what  marisha can i look at your eyes  sam i mean sure theyre the bluest of blue  marisha thats true do you know anything about your bloodline is there something about you i  feel like i have an essence about you now  travis how much of her brains were left in the rocks  laura i know she got rattled  matt yeah shes gone full phoebe from friends  travis yeah  /town/ liam im off to the side with grog going one two three shoot  sam my town here it doesnt have very many high hills but still stay on the ground will you  marisha okay  matt as you guys make your way into the actual city of deastok the architecture here is very  tall and as intricate as it is old the stonework is edged and almost sharp in places the shape and  design of most roofs and windows leaning towards the gothic you can see similar roots here to some  of whitestones older buildings /town/ and architecture common space where the original de rolos traveled  once from wildmount the architecture here as opposed to the more builtforfunction that a lot  of you are used to in taldorei anywhere from huts to i want to push almost tudor to colonial  this definitely has tall stone archways tall stainedglass windows in places a lot of the  buildings edges and roofs will come to tiny metal spires where points or occasionally flags or  tapestries would hang from in the wind very different visual feel than anything youve seen  over in taldorei  /none/ as you guys make your way through the streets in the presentational mode of which taryon has  requested people do stop and stare you can hear whispers some folks pointing some of the patrols  gather to keep a close eye as you pass no excitement no parade no cursing or aggression  just acknowledgement of the arrival of these strangers and a very flashy lord eventually you  lead them to the darrington estate this is a large threestory building surrounded by tall  iron piketopped gates that surround the somewhat octagonal shape of the grounds the main /none/ gate is  watched by a single man in a simple leather outfit and a metallic helmet who as he sees you  approach goes have you sir welcome home  sam thank you tell the master of the house that weve arrived  matt yes right away sir opens the gate and rushes off to the front door and disappears inside  for a moment the door opens again and you see emerging from it a very tall thin brassscaled  dragonborn with very fine clothing his lack of tail speaks of his ravinite lineage you recognize  this /none/ individual as berthold he is the servant of the house and quarters as he approaches he goes  oh master taryon it has been some time good to see you in good health  sam yes excellent to see you too youve been keeping the grounds quite nice  matt weve been doing our best i take it you and he looks over to the woman kryyn goes  you  yes i would like to complete my contract  very well please follow me inside this way the dragonborn turns around he almost towers over  you hes this /none/ spindling tree of a dragonborn as he leads you into the home you watch him he has  to dip down to enter the interior of the house as you step inside the estate youre immediately hit  with the smell of musty carpets wood oil stain and some since turnedtosmokeandembers burning  wood in a fireplace you see immediately in the darkly lit interior fine tables and wellcrafted  furniture that clutter hallways holding vases and dried flowers that probably have been in long need  of a change its eerily silent it seems at least on this floor /none/ empty of pretty much all life  except for berthold he begins to walk up the stairs right this way you know and he heads  up the second flight of stairs to the very top of the interior of the estate and there is the very  heavy oak door that marks the study quarters of your father he knocks lightly on the door  master howard you have some unexpected guests including the one you hired to bring your son  home and is here with your son  theres a pause you hear a voice on the /none/ other side say let them enter the door creaks open  creak  berthold steps back ill wait here he bows and gestures for you all to step into the room  as you guys step into this study you see standing right across from you looking into the fireplace  you occasionally hear the crack and the snap of what looks to be a halfway burned fire a human  man in his late forties his short blond hair is receding to the top of his head you can see the  firelight glistening across his somewhat oily forehead /none/ and two heavy sideburns that are an  uncombed mass that frame the sides of his very hardened square jaw he is dressed in a noblemans  coat and breeches though his shoes are nowhere to be seen just barefoot on the ground he looks  over and sees you enter and looks towards taryon and his hardened face turns to a softened smile  my son  sam papa  matt he looks over to the woman kryyn what ive heard is true and i thank you for your time  berthold will see that you are paid she /none/ nods there is a nod to you  sam youll wait for us outside the grounds and well give you your next assignment soon  matt that is the arrangement she leaves the room and you hear berthold walking alongside her  and chatting with her about payment as she leaves  as soon as they walk down the stairs he turns and goes i am glad to see you are well  sam are you you sent that woman to kidnap me  matt i sent that woman to bring you home to see that you were safe  /none/ sam she bound and gagged me and threw me on the back of a horse thats how you brought me home  matt youre a hard man to find when you want to be  sam i am literally the least hard man to find i tell everyone my name i wear a gold helmet and i  walk around talking about myself  matt his smile fades for a moment and yet you were very far from these lands  sam yes i was i was living a new life as i told you i would i was finding /none/ myself and  becoming someone  matt that is good just know that i was worried you fill your head with these fantasies and ideals  and step out into the unknown do you know how many men and women are found gutted in the streets  and left and abandoned to rot away in forests by some bandits on the roadside not to mention the  various beasts of the wild out there i was worried about you  sam well i was in danger for much of my time away but thats not a bad thing sometimes  /none/ becoming an adventurer or whatever i am now it wasnt supposed to be easy it was supposed to be  hard and it was and it had risks but along the way i did much and i stand before you now as a  different man than who left one who has been through a lot and knows the dangers of the world  but is also a survivor you know when i left i told you i was going to prove myself to you that  i would bring you back stories of my exploits and show you what /none/ kind of a man i really was and i  wrote a lot of them down in a book but i dont think i want to show it to you because i dont  think you deserve to see it you never supported me as a child and you dont now financially  yes but not as a father and the things i did while i was away well the book is a diary now  its for me not for you  matt taryon while my parenting may have been strict or distant at times i didnt reflect  /none/ on my care for you we have a legacy in this family to maintain  sam yes i know thats all you seem to care about  matt thats all that matters  sam its not all that matters i know that i carry your blood and that means a lot to you  matt this money that you seem to relish in that you took without asking the last of our  coffers your grandfather started this and ive done everything to maintain it and your  interests your attention could not be brought to learn and maintain this /none/ business after me so ive  had to turn to maryanne its not that i dont love you but you have another purpose in this  family and that is why ive brought you here  sam and what is that  matt and you watch as his hands are shaking and hes fidgeting and scratching his chin and running  his fingers through his sideburns were impoverished i havent been able to pay our staff  in nearly two months everything that i had to do to maintain this legacy has come back to bear  fruit and the /none/ debt that we owe is vast  sam i dont believe you wheres the money wheres the family money  matt he looks around at the rest of you and you can see now there is trepidation with having this  conversation in front of strangers  sam its all right theyre with me  matt he reaches over and grabs off his desk an already opened bottle of some sort of wine takes  a quick swig and sets it down slumps into his chair in front of the fire and rests his face on  his hand everything /none/ your grandfather oberon built its on the verge of fading away all the  taxes we claim on our lands now go straight to a syndicate that we owe a lot of money to unless  we find a way to pay off the debts of your father and his father before him we will all be thrown  into the cold or worse now ive seen this storm coming for a while taryon ive spent years  trying to coax a family union with the truscans you know this after much toil and diplomacy they  have agreed to /none/ wed you to their daughter lydia this union will bring our family a renewed avenue  to wealth and protection within the empire we can stave off this terrible end and you will be a  hero within the family  sam i dont understand the way we lived the way you talked made it seem like there was endless  money forever  matt this stems to your lack of respect  sam my lack of respect what happened how did you ruin us like this  laura what is this syndicate you speak of  matt his eyes /none/ dart to you with a fiery hatred like how dare you speak up right now when your  grandfather passed when you were still but a baby our lands were nearly taken from us by a  rival barony from within the dwendalian court lord jaipher found loopholes to revoking our  ownership and titles set by oberon and in my panic and necessity i found an ally in the myriad  sam in the myriad  matt through a whispered hint i met a man named korshad who ensured our surviving ownership in  trade for a partnership with /town/ him i signed not wanting to toss at the time my only child  onto the street but as the decades passed i did not realize in my haste the depths of the deal  that i had made and with many harvests failing in recent years the agreement now devours our  livelihood from within they now demand our accrued debt paid in full or they take full  ownership of everything  sam im having trouble wrapping my head around this youre saying everything ive lived has all  been built on this deal with this shady group /none/ youre a criminal youre just a criminal  matt no no it is built on what we built as a family  sam we didnt build anything as a family  matt we did and nearly had it taken away i did this to maintain it and i let you live as you all  deserved to live  sam but papa you never told me any of this you were cold to us and you told us a bare minimum of  what you did and how you ran things  matt i hoped to find a way to /none/ fix this before i needed to yet here i am prostrate before my own  child broken and he starts like tears just pour down his cheeks i was just trying to make  it right  sam i didnt know any of this how would i and now i have to fix it for you  by marrying some girl  matt its a marriage of convenience  sam thats still a marriage  matt it means nothing more than political gain your life is still yours to live  sam no its not i have to be here /dung/ i have to be with her i have to live in her castle or she in  mine sighs listen ive learned a lot from these people over the last year or so and one  thing ive learned is that you are who you are whether you have a lot of money or not and i  dont have that much anymore and im still okay with that and its not because of the things i  own its because of the deeds that i do youve done some bad deeds in your life and it sounds  like /none/ youve done them to preserve our family and preserve our legacy but thats  not a reason to do them  matt he leans forward to you and looks to you with an honest more honest than youve seen him  very vulnerable expression every man and woman who has money has done bad things  sam yes im sure thats true and i assume im somehow complicit in this  matt you are not i tried to keep you your sister and your mother as innocent as i could my  back is to a wall now  sam /none/ ill have to think about this  matt think on it the choice is still yours i would not force you into this but it is a chance  i wish you to contemplate  sam what have you done to our name do people know of this  matt no  sam and if i marry this girl it will just all go away  matt if you marry this girl we will have the influence and the wealth to pay this debt and cut  ties with the myriad entirely we would be a free family once more /none/  laura how much debt are we talking  matt the last amount we were given 230000 gold  laura well thats a lot  ashley is there any other way than marriage that you can think of  matt ive exhausted the options i have at my disposal  laura what if we just wipe out the myriad  matt he laughs  sam theyre far too big  matt you underestimate the sheer size and how ingrained they are in the society here this is no  guild wildmount is the myriad in many ways  sam and /town/ if i say no and they take all of our possessions and our estate everything what then  were ruined  matt were on the street we are but beggars within our own city at the mercy of those weve  been taxing  sam how could you do this to us  matt because i loved you i loved you all and i did what was necessary  sam you never told us that you always talked about bloodlines and legacies and the darrington  name but you never told us you were proud you never comforted us you /none/ never cared what i wanted  to do or who i wanted to be im cursed with this name now darrington youve sullied our name by  enforcing these taxes and just being an asshole to everyone around our whole city and now i have to  live with it or marry this girl to save it listen im sorry i left and im sorry i took all  of that gold i did not know it was everything but what youre asking me is ill need to think  im sorry  matt i owe you that at least /none/ i never claimed to be a good man i never claimed to be a good  father good husband but i can try to be better cant i  sam yes you can im going to go see mother and sister might my friends stay here the night  matt of course and enjoy the grounds while you can  laura this korshad and the myriad where do you meet with him  matt its been some time but if you wish to seek him out ask for who you can speak with the  many in the grumpy lily /town/  sam grumpy lillian  matt the grumpy lily you know this to be one of the seedier bars in town  sam oh okay  laura and im asking to speak with the many  matt youre wishing to speak with the many  laura all right  sam well good to see you have a good afternoon  matt im glad youre safe  sam thank you its good to see you again  matt you too more than you know my son  laura do we leave the room  sam yes lets leave the room  /none/ liam we could have cut that air with a knife  laura so heres the thing though you said he like hated you and he didnt seem like he hated  you at all  sam hes acting differently than i recall its been a while im not used to seeing him like  this and honestly i dont know how to take it  laura well you cant marry that bitch  ashley you cant marry her  sam it seems like i have to  laura and ashley no you dont  travis got to do it  /none/ sam grog says i do  laura grog  travis simplest the shortest distance between two  ashley two points  travis yep is  sam marriage  travis marriage yep  laura youre getting so smart grog so smart  travis dont be jealous  liam i know some about the myriad correct  matt youve encountered them once back in stillben back at the very beginning of your  adventures the very beginning  taliesin not me  matt percy this is the first youve heard  marisha wait you  laura he wasnt with us yet we /none/ had that other guy he was playing  laughter  liam rusty rusty trombone  taliesin rusty trombone  sam he was a weird character choice  matt thats a good name for an artificer  laughter  matt as you exit the study and close the door behind you left in the cold quiet silence of the  house you continue your conversation  taliesin where is your sister  sam i dont know  laura how much money did you take when you left  sam i thought a meager amount 50000 gold  marisha thats a lot /none/  laura but i mean considering the debt that theyre in  marisha thats literally more than my entire tribe owns  laura well we have a lot more than that in our party fund  marisha i know we own more than my tribe owns  taliesin i own more than your tribe owns  marisha i know i will say tary i think you are special you have very large dangling bits  along with your earring very large other bits  sam thank you  taliesin we were working on that particular compliment and i feel like /none/ we have a little way  to go  marisha is it all right no i thought that was a compliment  sam tell her she did good  travis are you cool with your sister  sam no im not cool with my sister shes not that great  travis is she married  taliesin do you think she knows about this  sam i guess i suppose she knows about this  marisha and the last time you spoke with her was when you left im assuming  sam yes thats right she was being groomed as the /dung/ heir to the family and i was being shut out my  mother is here somewhere too shes pretty quiet  taliesin what do you want to do  sam i guess talk to them but we cant go after the myriad theyre powerful and dark  travis what if we offer services and they excuse part of the debt  sam no he offered services and look where it got him  ashley do you know lydia  matt youve never met lydia in your life you dont even know what she looks like  taliesin im not even /none/ sure if thats something that should be entertained  sam we could go talk to them but i dont see how thats going to change anything  laura maybe shes a really cool girl that wont be into you and you can just hang out and be  besties  sam gross  laura hey  sam no i like being besties with you i dont want some rando  taliesin its not fair to her either  marisha its not honestly maybe we should just go talk to her first  sam lydia  laura no shes in a /town/ whole other town  ashley heres the thing youre not going to marry her okay  sam why not  ashley because if he wants to be a better father to you then hes going to let this go and not  let you do this if that means him being out on the street thats my opinion  travis thats harsh  sam everything he is is his status though this place where he lives his servants if hes got  nothing then hes just hell die  ashley sometimes when you let that go only then are you /none/ able to truly live  travis whoa  laura deep  sam that is maybe true but listen ive been working on this for a year and im starting to  get really nervous im down to my last few bits of gold and i dont know how that would feel to  run out  ashley i dont even have any money  laura because you gave it all away  travis technically ive got a lot of money  ashley money gives you everything you want  laura its the best thing  marisha hey but youre thrifty /none/ youre good  sam no im not thrifty  marisha yes you are taryon ive seen make amazing things you can survive youve been to  the depths of the watery abyss and youve lived kind of  taliesin thats a bad example  laura im really wishing we had taken a lot more money from thordak if we had taken more money  everything would be fine right now  marisha no thats not the lesson of the story you guys  sam yes money would have solved this  marisha no not the lesson not the lesson were /none/ supposed to take away  taliesin no i mean hes right that money would have solved this but thats not the lesson  keyleth is right  marisha i dont have an alternative for the lesson its just not the lesson  taliesin were here we can figure out a way out of this were smart were clever were  powerful and whats one more cliff  marisha yeah were gods  taliesin not again  travis not going to say that ever again  ashley i say we go talk to the many  laura yes lets go talk /town/ to the many  liam i understand this is very complicated are we really looking for a solution to fix several  generations of your familys misdeeds it sounds like your father your grandfather have been  navigating murky waters for some time  taliesin i want to find out what your sister knows  liam i dont know what the right decision is either do you marry this woman to fix decades of  terrible decisions  taliesin i dont necessarily see how two wrongs right anything here its just really kicking the  ball down the road while /none/ you make another random human being you have not met miserable  laura thats right  sam i assume i would be a fine husband  laura youd be amazing  sam i feel like id be okay  liam you make really good blondies and many things besides blondies as well  taliesin oh this is so depressing im not going to even pretend that this is true absolutely not  no youll be miserable and that will make her miserable  sam yes its true  liam so if we know that thats not happening then we deal /none/ with the problem that is left behind  which is do we worry about your familys life their safety are they safe here or are  they gonna be eaten alive  sam id assume they are not safe here wed have to convince them to leave or protect them  somehow or make a deal to at least protect them in poverty  laura maybe we just talk to the myriad talk to korshad and see what we can do maybe he needs  something and we can provide it  taliesin we are bad news for anybody like /town/ that im sure it would be worth their time to get us  out of town possibly get you out of town you cant be good

long either  liam ive got this great trick but i can only do it once  marisha in my head i was an awesome cartoon and it worked  matt and it would have but it got down to the dice as always if i
