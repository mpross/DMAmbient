/none/ matt oh hi i didnt see you there im hanging out this afternoon apparently reading some  fantastic books and excited to hang out with a lot of you fun interesting elements on the  internet but i figure lets go ahead and make it comfortable lets enjoy ourselves a little bit of  personal time together and get to know a little bit about each other ive got some fine port here  to keep me company like you do on a tuesday afternoon at 400pm i poured a lot in there so  this is whats called not /none/ being the designated driver  anyway im glad you could join me were going to have a good time hopefully this is going to be a  general hang out get to know each other type circumstance as far as the types of questions  the quality of questions they can be game related they can be critical role related they  can be roleplaying game related they can be voiceover industry related they can be just life  related they can be stuff about my history or telling me about your history just opening  conversations about that i /town/ want this to be an open hangout a whatever youre curious about and  then i might ask some curious things back so yeah this is just a hangout  thank you for the robe recommendation this is the finest quality i could find for 20 on amazon and  it met my expectations it is every bit as shitty as i expected but anyway welcome well get a  ways into this qa and then maybe well start creating an npc and a monster for the campaign a  little ways down the road so cheers oh that is /none/ nice that is sweet anyway glad you could join  us this will be interesting lets begin with some fun questions here if i can remember how to  get the pad here open possibly maybe well find out if i learn technology if youve seen the  periscopes you know that me and technology strangely do not mix very well but thats okay  first question i see in there is wheres larkin thats a better question for liam  obrien larkin resides in the same location that raishan does which is as far as everyone knows  very /none/ deceased by the way for the record if youre not caught up on critical role im going to  try and avoid spoilers but something may squeeze through and i apologize in advance  did i fix the yard fix is a relative term i got the yard mowed and then the remnants of the  mowing could fill eight or nine of our green bins so weve been slowly offloading it week after  week and our yard in the meantime looks like a series of hills its terrifying but we are  getting it taken care of hopefully /none/  lets see what questions weve got here it is a founders reserve porto sandeman it looks like it  has darkman on the cover i know people say zorro im going to go darkman because thats the person  i am if you havent seen darkman its awesome the first one dont see the rest of them leslie  nielsen actually the first thing i really knew him from  well get to the first question at the top whats your favorite trope in dd or just in  general what was your favorite storyline besides the chroma conclave /town/ this is from nikosia good  question favorite trope in dd those are fantasy tropes in general and i personally really like  political intrigue the fightthemonsters is fun but i like the idea of trying to balance that with  nations that are warring or crumbling there hasnt been a lot of that in this campaign because  i cant fit every theme and every trope in every campaign but i wouldnt be surprised if those  elements show up in campaigns down the road personally i really enjoy challenges that involve  more finesse besides just bursting into /dung/ doors and defeating creatures so thats a big fan of mine  as far as previous campaigns that i really enjoyed i ran the expedition at castle ravenloft  and that was an absolute blast i adored that campaign as i ran it so that one has a special  place in my heart and had some political intrigue which was fun  whats another fun question whats my favorite class in dd by lairohi which im probably  butchering that my apologies seriously im really sorry about that ive always loved  casters caster classes were a big thing /none/ for me growing up i love the options of spellcasting and  the utility factor for a party you may not be the most powerful or the most survivable except the  later levels get powerful it is nice to be able to take care of some of those challenges the rest  of the party is like i dont know what to do were kind of fucked and youre like wait i  got a spell for that youre essentially the clippy paperclip of dd and i love that that was a lot  of fun  that chatroom /none/ is moving really fast were cultivating questions from the chat so dont  worry even if it goes past were keeping an eye out has the raishan trophy mount arrived  yet it has arrived we havent opened it yet were planning another critmas scheduling has  been a pain in the butt between completing the campaign guide general work and multiple  projects at once and everyone elses busy schedules organizing another day to do a critmas  has been very arduous endeavor but were zeroing down on it soon we will have that soon and then  well /none/ have all of them and we might actually be adding them to the set over here pretty soon as  one once again you guys are amazing thank you again  how surprised was i when liam killed everyone midlast week from critternation3000 laughs  definitely surprised i wasnt expecting him to just throw out you know the abyss against a  bunch of level one uses that early in i had an inkling he was going to do one of those you wake  up and youre still okay in another realm or youre out of your sleep circumstance /none/ but the  party was like it would also be fitting if he literally brought me in to be a player for the  first time in a long time in his game and he fucking throws a demogorgon at me and kills me in  one hit and thats it and thanks matt for playing because as much as that sucks on one  degree that shit would be funny that would be so funny  im going to adjust this real fast because its turning off rather quickly on me if i can find  it because i /none/ dont know where its all organized where is the settings on this son of a there it  is i see it pardon me internet i appreciate your patience were going to head down to the  control center general display autolock in 15 minutes thatll work fine thank you pardon me  for the slight delay there friends i appreciate your patience if i could pull it up to where i  was there we go thank you im going to have another sip of port because its that kind of day  glad you can come and join /none/ me matt did you know that is not a real fireplace behind you from  pskinner  offscreen laughter its a tv  matt i knew that but i appreciate you looking out and its really sweet of you and even if i  didnt know and this was my actual home and i totally believed it was a fireplace would you  want to be the one person to tell me that it wasnt do you want to be that guy that out of  the sake of the necessity to be right you would tear down the illusion /none/ i built around me because  you are that guy think about that goddamn thats good good call ryan ryan green chose the  drink of choice and did a fine job  good question thamgoule im going to butcher all these names sorry asks what do i think of  the new mystic class ive had a tumultuous relationship with psionics for a large portion of  their dd existence i like the idea of psychicbased classes but the psychic points  system always felt like it didnt fit in the rest of the theme of dd from previous /town/ editions i  looked at the new mystic class and its got a lot of really cool options im uncertain of it it  seems like a lot of everything in one class it definitely has a few options that are extremely  overpowered which is why its in test and why the unearthed arcana is a really good place to try  these things out and give feedback and they can tweak it down the road i feel like it does feel a  bit trying to accomplish everything at once so id like to see it maybe be /none/ a little more fine  tuned into a theme that stood out amongst the classes which is hard because the classes as a  person whos designed and tried to design unique things in the game a lot of bases are already  covered so you really got to stick to a unique style or try your best to at the very least i  like the idea of the mystics im not sold on them yet im curious to see after testing if they ever  release an official document with a final design and to see how that /none/ turns out id like to take a  look at it as we go and give some feedback of my own maybe i will wizards of the coast moving on  a question from alesia shaeffer when starting the campaign how much did you start with what  level did everyone start at everyone started at level three at the time i could have gone earlier  level but i thought it was just a oneshot and i wanted it to be enough of a character ability  spread that they had at least a number of options at their /none/ disposal so it was a level three  oneshot the characters were originally built in 4th edition for that oneshot because it was the  most buttonpush i tell you the three abilities you have and how often you can use them and then  we play the game and thats how it came together once it became a campaign then we converted over  to pathfinder we were already at level three and it was fine and it went from there if youre new  to dd i highly recommend starting at level one for at least a few /none/ games because its enough where  you can learn the rules without feeling overloaded with options especially if youre playing a  caster once youve played a game or two where you feel more comfortable starting a campaign around  level two or halfway through two which is what im doing for the next campaign i think is good  because it doesnt feel like youre having to trudge through that very first level if you know  the game pretty well and have enough experience but also youre not locked into your archetypes  for your class so based /none/ on the choices and experiences you have in the first few sessions  that can really inform the direction you want the character to take so by the time you level up to  level three youve had a few games under your belt and you can make an informed decision on the  type of variation of that class you want to pursue so thats my opinion  got some more questions what is my favorite tabletop rpg system from thermavoire  thermavoire thats fun it sounds like theramore which didnt do so well in the lore of warcraft /none/ so  im glad you changed the pronunciation im partial to dd just because it means so much to me  as far as the genre im a big high fantasy person its the first game i ever played its  the game that i play most often now the newer editions have gotten a lot better about weaving  narrative into actual gameplay but i dont know i really dug the palladium system im kidding  thats not true the palladium systems ridiculous i like the themes of some of the  games like the ridiculousness of rifts but /none/ when you start getting into 1d4 times one million  megadamage weapons it gets a little intense  i like them all for different reasons uniquewise i really enjoyed the amber diceless  roleplaying game for those who havent read the amber series its actually a pretty cool series  of books and its an rpg that the system is based more upon the gm logistically considering what  succeeds versus what fails based on character creation and ingenuity and how you present the  challenge and your answer to it i thought that was a pretty cool way of /none/ doing it though the  randomization of the dice makes things interesting too so i like that the traveler  system was fun the traveler system is great one of the few games you can die in character  creation liked that in paranoia that was a good one im probably going to have to stick with 5th  edition right now i think its a nice blend of enough rules and numbers and interesting character  options that you can still create and customize a character but still be an easy flow from  narrative to combat its not /none/ perfect no system is really perfect from my standpoint at least  but its closest to the kind of system that i would want to play i actually like that a lot  from zemedelfos which sounds like something youd fight in xenogears question what do you  recommend when you have players that its hard to get all together but have no good reason for the  character to suddenly pop in and out between sessions not many of them are big into jaegering  another persons character thats actually a very good question ive had this challenge many /none/  times there are a couple ways you could do it if your party is not terribly locked into having to  keep a very realistic narrative and you can introduce somewhat silly suspensionofdisbelief  moments in the game you can introduce elements like the heroes as part of this venture were all  cursed or locked to a specific artifact and at randomized times it will fold or steal the players  into an alternate reality and so when the players cant be there all of a sudden the orb claims  them and theyre not there and they /none/ have to wait for them to return also having ventures where  the planes can be unstable and occasionally individuals fade from one realm to the other  without given warning and that can be part of the overall narrative to stop these planes from  crossing and thus different party members can vanish and come back and it doesnt really affect  the narrative flow because youve already established a reason of that being the case so  you can run it more narrativelevel like that you can make it like i do where you try and come up /none/  with a creative reason for them to leave if youre in the middle of a circumstance you can  have them kidnapped by a monster and now part of the adventure is also trying to save them its  the eternal challenge its not an easy answer for it its easier if youre playing more of a  tongueincheek game and you all can lean into it a bit and there could even be in the same realm  like a curse that befit the party and on certain phases of the moon you might turn into cardboard  /none/ and players have to fold you and put you in the bag of holding until youre ready to come out  again in your full form those silly ways make it a lot easier and you can have fun with it that  way but when you need a narrative you can try to find an overarching reason as to why they have to  jump in and out occasionally its not easy i dont have a great answer for it but thats the  best i can give you because thats all ive done in the past  question /none/ from phantomsruinlives any tips on dealing with audition nerves waiting to hear back  on an audition yes audition nerves never go away and i know youre like oh god i mean  theyll dwindle over time but those butterflies never go away in fact you learn to harness them  you learn to use that nervous energy as a positive thing part of that only comes with experience  another is coming to terms with the fact that youre not there to prove that youre right for  the job theyre just seeking whoever is right for the job /none/ and if it happens to be you its you if  its not its not so the pressure isnt to be better than other people its to be the best you  can be for yourself and if youre right for that particular role that you auditioned for then  theyll probably book you and if not somebody else was better for it it doesnt mean theyre  better than you but they were a better fit for that one character and trying to keep that  mindset over time its not a you versus them mentality youre doing your /none/ very best and if you  dont get it its not because youre bad necessarily its because you werent right for  that particular job and as a casting director youre not just casting people youre weaving a  tapestry where youre reading for one character they have a view of the entire cast all the  characters and archetypes and story elements that have to weave together so they might audition you  and other people that sound amazing for the roles but you might sound too similar and so as an  ensemble it doesnt work to have /town/ you both in these roles that are so close together so they  might cast somebody else for that that doesnt mean that you werent great for the job but for  the sake of casting the project as a whole they had to go with something else but theyll still  keep you in mind for stuff down the road thats another thing too even if you dont book  something if you knock it out of the park in the audition people will keep you in mind i cant  tell you how many projects that ive read /town/ for and didnt book anything and then a year and a half  two years later they call me in to read on something or book me on something because theyre  like loved your read for that wasnt right for the character but something else came up down the  road that we liked you for and we wanted to have you read on that now too so it can help you  regardless dont be too hard on yourself for not booking a gig the auditioning process is part of  the learning and the experience  also /none/ i recommend dont wait to hear back on an audition a really healthy mindset when it comes  to that process whether it be voiceover oncamera everything is to do your best youre  doing the job in the room youre doing the best you can and then once its done let it go and  move on to the next endeavor focus on the next opportunity focus on the next class you can take  focus on the next character you can explore and let that audition go it may take some time to  learn that type of /none/ behavior but you really have to release it that way if it doesnt happen  youve already forgotten about it and youre already focusing on bigger and better things if  it does happen thats a fantastic surprise so thats my recommendation in that regard too this  is delicious i will try my best not to get extremely intoxicated i do not promise anything  fickedup asks have i ever larped i have not field character costume larped yet i havent  because i havent had time or because im scared ill like it too much i have a /none/ lot of friends  that do it and its consumed them its become their biggest hobby they put all this time and  energy into costumes and stuff and i know i would do that and i just have too much stuff going on  i have larped vampire once i was pulled into a larp it was up in simi valley in the early  2000s and it was this huge chapter of a bunch of theater kids from a theater magnet school that i  met through community theater and they invited me to come be part of /none/ this i had no backstory on it  and i was thrust into a very political figure that was introduced by the prince of that whole area as  his new righthand man so i became this political intrigue focus for the evening with no  backstory no idea of how the political dynamics worked and i was thrown to the wolves if you  will and there were wolves there werewolves anyway so it wasnt the best experience it was  unique it was different but i was out of my element there and got spooked off a bit /none/ from that  i still had a good time but if i had another chance i know what to ask for as far as research  and background to actually fit in i think its awesome i did run a show for a while called  adventure a stage show that my friend coleman ran marisha was part of it and bonnie gordon  who youve seen here a ton she was part of it xander came and played a number of times our  fantastic taliesin was in it with us courtney our fantastic alpha mistress over there she /none/ came  and was part of it many times it was a live roleplay stage show where we pulled members from  the audience as pcs and wed pull them through a storyline where we were the npcs changing  costumes behind the scenes and going from sequence to sequence it was a lot of fun i guess thats  the closest thing ive done to larping but once again always npcs always the dm its fine  lets start our first poll lets start getting some of our fun character design stuff going here  lets begin with the /none/ npc on this one how its going to work is im going to start asking for  some suggestions from the chat and keeping an eye out when i ask for a certain thing and then ill  pick a few well throw them into a straw poll that straw poll will be up for about a minute  minute and a half so youll rush in when the links available in the chat vote and then when  that time is up well call it and thats what were going with for that aspect of the npc first  /none/ and foremost lets pick a race for the npc type into the chat here what race you think it should  be were talking if its human halfling tiefling halforc goliath anything you want  just type them in there im going to pay attention for a second to see what seems to be  popping up more often than not oh thats a lot i can see forever seeing a lot of halforc well  put halforc on there thatll be one of them were passing by a lot of human and a lot of  drow thatll be /none/ interesting too hmm you guys havent seen much drow in taldorei hmm theyre  there which youll see in the campaign guide and dragonborn so thats four and well do one more  a lot of genasi going some unique classes there and a little human thrown in just for some  averageness i believe that is drow halforc genasi human and dragonborn cool so were  going to go ahead and get that situated for you guys here in a moment well have the voting start  for that race well have about two minutes and then well come /none/ back with an answer and that will  set in the race for the npc its fun communal construction i havent done it like this this  will be fun once that straw poll is done the link will be in the chat and vote in the  meantime im going answer another question  george fletcher asks what is your favorite kind of cheese see i like these questions i like  these strange nongamerelatedones peppered through interesting weird tidbits of things  youve ever wondered about why im such a weird person because im a very weird person /none/ favorite  type of cheese i really like smoked goudas ive actually recently gotten really a fan of extra  aged gouda it has a slight caramelish almost crunchy crystals in it that with some pita chips  and some wine is good or some honey what would i pair with my current drink i have no idea im  not a wine and cheese snob i know so little im really good at trying to actually no im  really bad at trying to fake like im a cultured person because i dont know have you seen my  /none/ dragon socks okay i am not at all a cultured person for this honestly probably smores this  is a very sweet port so id go more of a smores its not cheese but deal with it thats my  answer anyway next question  from galastan question hey matt thanks for being my lifelong inspiration im planning to  break into the vo industry and currently taking voice acting lessons is there anything else you  recommend doing to get an edge in an admittedly cutthroat industry thats an interesting  question cold reading training ive said it before /none/ and ill say it again training in classic  forms of acting and performance is so important being comfortable and experienced enough to where  you can jump into a scene and make confident choices not worrying if theyre the right choices  but whatever feels natural thats the thing too a lot of people get caught up in their head about  am i making the right decisions am i making the right impulses am i feeling this out correctly  as long as youre making some choice youre doing it right because youre going with your  instincts /none/ and its taking you there and if its not the right direction the director who its  their job will guide you back on track but they much prefer to have somebody whos bold in their  choices and commits to the path they take as opposed to somebody whos unable to decide which  path they want to go with a character choice so thats big but for voice over in particular read  out loud whatever dont even look at it get a script or get a book throw it in front of you  and start reading /none/ out loud as you read it for the first time because thats most of the job you  want to take scripts and learn to cold read most of the job is cold reading rarely do you get a  script in advance for a project and most of the time you walk into the booth and youre around  sound proofing by yourself with a glass window and a director and multiple other people in the  room looking at you through it going okay go and you have to go thats the job cold reading  learning to /none/ be comfortable to read things spontaneously as you receive them out loud listen  back record yourself doing it and listen and you can selfcritique and work on your annunciation  work on understanding the flow of dialogue dont be afraid to take beats a lot of people  especially when they begin they read everything through but characters breathe they have  thoughts midsentence they stammer so another thing too is breathing life into a scene as a  character consider what action theyre taking during it if you read a scene where a persons in  a kitchen /none/ you read the dialogue as well yeah of course but if were going to go on a vacation  least we can do is try and bring the family or think about them doing the dishes a minute like  well of course grunts i mean if were going to go on vacation we might as well bring the  family suddenly even though its just audio you imagine that person doing a physical activity  you immediately envision a part of the kitchen that wasnt there before think of the character  think of beats moments exerts things that /none/ can breathe life into their physicality even though  youre just reading their voice out loud those are good things to keep in mind as youre learning  a scene or playing out a character and if its not the right choice the director once again  will correct you but rather have you make choices than not  do we have an answer on the straw poll drow by 60 oh man we might be getting some story on  the ruhnshak soon you dont know what that is you will in august the npc race is drow we /none/ have  a drow npc we are off to the races okay so now that we have a drow npc think of the occupation  that drow has that can be a character class or it can be a position like a politician or a guild  master or an artisan or a cutthroat or a mastermind or whatever you think an occupation for  this npc would be good for spy is a good one okay well look at this for a second well see  what comes through i see a lot of warlock well put warlock on /none/ there i see a lot of baker  theres a lot of bakers in there its a big spread warlock baker i see a lot of prince  they want some royalty some sort of royal or noble blood involved in there thatll be  interesting you guys are ridiculous bounty hunters come up quite a bit thats a fun one  okay im going to go for a last one here oh my god its like looking into the matrix its  whoosh theres a lot of prostitute which is rad because sex trades an awesome legitimate  form /none/ of business for a lot of good people so prostitutes in there so what is the listing we  have warlock baker royalty bounty hunter prostitute were going to go ahead and get that  straw poll going here in a minute take a minute or two to vote and well see where this takes us  this should be very unique  okay then so back to the next question here arthur dent asks question how do you set  magical item prices this is a good question there is in the dmg in the magical item treasure  /none/ section early into it there is a table that gives you the general price range for items by rarity  so you go from common uncommon rare very rare and legendary and it gives you 500 gold to 5000  gold 5000 gold to 50000 gold yeah it doesnt really help a lot so it comes with understanding  power levels in the game if its a very rare item but its a pretty damn powerful very rare  item im like damn thats a good very rare item with a lot of abilities ill probably set  that a /none/ little higher up its a 5000 to 50000 and thats a really powerful item ill set it at  40 to 45000 gold and if they want to persuade whoevers selling it down a little bit maybe if  its an uncommon which is pretty low i think its 50 to 500 and its pretty easy and minimal  like a tanglefoot bag ill probably set it about 50 60 gold tops nothing too big a lot of it is  improvising it based on the range thats in the gms guide and the power level how i understand  /town/ it doesnt mean that its right or wrong but as a gm you get to set those based on your  experience its okay if you mess it up a little from what you consider the players wont know any  better its your world you set the prices i recommend you writing them down prices can change  from person to person prices arent the same everywhere an item might be really common in one  town and really uncommon in another across the continent so the prices might be jacked up in  those various places its a /none/ combination of improvising based on what i can ascertain of the  items power level along with the range they give in the dmg i hope thats helpful  question from niche asks are you surprised by what some of what vox machina has decided to do in  this past year yes actually and im excited we actually got together last night and went  through what everyone wanted to accomplish did some rolls it was a throwback to our early days  playing at home in some ways it wasnt a full session but for things they wanted /none/ to accomplish  there were rolls to see if the challenge succeeded or not and what were going to do is begin the  session on thursday going through those lists discussing what happened and possibly playing out  a few scenes that involve what theyre hoping to accomplish so thats going to be what thursday  begins with its going to be fun its going to be interesting theres some interesting choices  grog has one thing in particular that the players dont know about thats going to be real  interesting grogs such a terrible person okay are /none/ we about good to close that straw poll  baker drow baker we have a drow baker thats going to be awesome i am excited about this  builttoofast says is bloodhunter being added into your campaign there was a bloodhunter npc  and the bloodhunter orders are part of the exandria lore they mostly stem from wildemount  but yes there is called the claret orders within exandria they havent come within  taldorei they havent come prominently into the story i dont know if they will well see how  that plays out but they are part of /none/ taldorei  so next question and then well get back to the next bit for the npc sirrays question about  life you always try to be positive and downtoearth how do you do it laughs i dont  always succeed i dont know thats interesting its a weird question i dont know just be  empathic be willing to make mistakes and own up to them learn from them and no matter how much a  person frustrates you makes you angry or tries to hurt you maintain a point of perspective that you  dont understand what theyve /none/ gone through to get them there what their day was leading them to  that moment what abuses theyve undergone what difficulties challenges and failures theyre  ruminating on at that time and youve become an outlet for it  thats not always the case there are bad people in the world by all means and i do understand  that but i think a lot of dissidence stems from peoples inability to imagine what the other side  of this might be so allowing yourself that expansion to be able to give people the benefit  of the doubt /none/ and think i know what they said is really terrible but maybe theyre having a really  terrible day week month maybe they lost a friend or family member and theyre just lashing  out you dont know that perspective makes it a lot easier to not take things to heart and step  away and that opens empathy for others  and that even goes for everyday encounters when you stop at a gas station to order gas make eye  contact with the attendant and ask them how their days been its amazing how quickly youll see  /none/ people open up and smile when you engage them as a human being and not as just part of a transaction  i recommend you try that on a daytoday basis it makes every day that much more lively it makes  you really appreciate how so many different backgrounds how many different people who all  have their own story their own trials and tribulations and they all come together to make  this beautiful world that we all live in so good days and bad days were all human beings and  were all trying to be happy /none/ keep that in mind that helps its helped me so far  were now getting to the next aspect of the npcs design here so they are a drow baker according  to chats design what is their interest in vox machina which if there are any members of vox  machina on the sound stage they should be leaving right now because were getting  into narrative elements  taliesin bye  matt taliesin jaffe  taliesin bye im going now you have pretty eyes  matt you have pretty eyes he does have really pretty eyes he has /none/ really pretty eyes  clicks tongue that got weirdor did it  the bakers interest in vox machina all right well grog has been put in a bunch so theres  an interest in grog i can expand upon that if that should win so we have grog as one option  people here are throwing out wedding so ill put that in there vengeance vengeance is always a  fun one and a nice change up from the previous suggestions youve given this is a lot here i  know this is a rough process guys were all figuring /none/ this out as we go but were trying the  best we can  were getting a lot of repeating ones that weve already said okay fanboy ive seen  come up quite a few times well go with that and the last one will be bring tary home thats  interesting we got what was it again grog wedding vengeance fanboy bring tary home those  are the five choices were going to throw those up in the chat on the straw poll take a minute or  two to get your votes in well see which one of /none/ those comes out on top this is a very interesting  process evil laugh people saying mic is low i dont know if thats the case or it was just  their screen but if its just your computer too bad turn up your volume  next question pineapples on pizza yea or nay eh i made a third option ive had it and its  all right not my preference i wouldnt go out of my way to order pineapples on pizza but if  pineapples show up on pizza its the only pizza there im not going to /none/ be like i will not eat  you ill go all right and ill eat it im in between not meant to be a cop out literally  that is my answer i hope that was helpful that was from kidcross by the way thank you kid  rossreynolds asks how do you balance your major part in critical role and your career as a voice  actor im still figuring it out oh thank you ryan  ryan your popcorn sir  matt wondrous oh look at this delivery system its glorious the robe made me gilmore suddenly  /none/ i dont know why im going to have some more of that port this isnt a bad way to spend a tuesday  afternoon with you guys thanks for chilling with me this is good  how do i balance critical role with being a voice actor i dont know yet im still working on it  when you live a career for long enough that could end tomorrow and you dont know where youre next  paycheck is coming from and its a passion you end up doing odd jobs to make rent doing temp  work doing data /none/ entry environmental agencies or stocking warehouses you learn to say yes to  everything its the idea that whenever opportunity arises you seize it i feel very  fortunate that in recent years because of all the hard work and because of shows like critical  role that have had a lot of more opportunities arise i probably said yes to a lot of things i  shouldnt have and in doing so its consumed most of my free time and its driving me a little  crazy but im learning that balance both me and marisha are each others /none/ support in both of our  lives getting a little crazy and trying to make sure we allow time for selfcare and spending time  together and carving out time for the people that are closest to us part of the reason critical  role is so important to us it isnt just the show but honestly its a chance every week for  us to get to hang out with some of our favorite people that we dont have the time to most of the  other days of the week or month so its still something im working /none/ on i have a lot of projects  on my plate right now finishing the campaign guides going to be a big weight off my chest  were in the final throes of it right now im really excited for you i hope you guys like it  but im learning that process now im notoriously work myself to death i tend to take on too much  and try to get it done and its not the healthiest thing so im working on it so my  answer is i dont know im still trying ill let you know /none/ in a year if i figure out the secret  otherwise i dont know  pertlikethefruit asks is there some type of npc in particular youve been itching to introduce  but the moment never presented itself yeah theres a few npcs that ive created that never  had a chance to show up but im not going to tell you because any npc that doesnt get a chance  and any dm or gm will tell you this an npc that you like that doesnt have the opportunity to  shine or show up goes back in the toolbox /none/ for later so theyll come back eventually im sure  theyll come back theyll come back trust me  torchbaricane asks whats my favorite type of cookie that would be gingersnap gingersnaps are  awesome because theyre not loaded down with too much sweetness but its got the right amount of  cinnamon spice i like things that are sweet and spicy so gingersnaps are pretty great yeah ill  go with that  lets go with the next npc choice since we got that locked in now we did a couple questions  there this is so delightfully chaotic /none/ i apologize but thank you for sticking with me on  this what is the answer bring tary home oh man this is going to be fun cool got that in  there and the second to last thing im going to ask about this npc is they have a secret theres  something that this npc is keeping a secret that may or may not unfold in the game we dont know  but youll know and ill know but what is this npcs secret go ahead and introduce into the chat  room what your ideas are keep /none/ them concise if you can well get that worked out so put it into  the chat room and well pull some out as they go  laughs okay  theyre a drow thats not a very good secret theyre not keeping it very well unless theyre  an illusion i mean its possible hmm  hmm theres a lot of interesting here  lets try okay hes a revenant  thats an interesting one im trying to pick things that might work into the next campaign i  dont want to pick anything thats going to wreck it or /none/ the storyline that i have worked out in my  head so im having to cherrypick a little bit for this one secretly a paladin thats  interesting can play with that put ziggurat on there just ziggurat  hes a hitman  oh man this is so nuts oh thats interesting hes blind there we go some interesting ones  there some fun little things that can be utilized some of these secrets you guys put on  there might roll into other things that were already mentioned well see how that plays out  so reading us back /none/ what do we have revenant secretly a paladin ziggurat what was the other  ones hitman or hes blind okay so were going to throw that up into the chat in a moment to get  that straw poll going and well see which one of those wins out to be the npcs secret thatll be  interesting blind is not exactly a secret you say however with the right magic you can keep it  a secret i have ideas dont worry i can play with this  jayredwine says howd you get into burning man about 2008 or /none/ so i was in a bit of a rough patch  losing my faith in humanity and the arts in a lot of ways i was in a rough period selfesteem  personal stuff and my acting coach at the time who hilariously is taliesins mom kether she  had been going for many years she said you would enjoy this and you should go this would be  a good thing for you and i was like i dont know im not into the whole hippie drug culture  i had my thoughts of what the event was shes /none/ like its not like that i mean it is like  that in some ways but not really all right fine ill go i made a lot of excuses she  didnt let me adhere to them eventually went and it was a lot more than i expected its  certainly not for everybody its a harsh environment its a very open culture of all walks  of life culture sexualities expressions a lot of people there just walk nude a lot of art  hippiedippie stuff that a lot of people probably couldnt even deal with or would hate /none/ entirely  but for me it was a wonderful environment of adults at play for a week and i really enjoyed  it it became a very important part of my life so i go every year its my cleansing my reset  button my creative need to return to the default world ive met a few critters out there who are  burners as well theyve come by operator is a nice guy if youre watching hello operator  hopefully see you this year but its definitely not for everybody its hard to get there its  hard to /none/ survive out there its a harsh desert made of highalkali playa powder electronics die  out there its hot you have to bring everything in to survive and then bring it out but if  youre ready to make the journey there and if you have that artistic mindset it can be a really  cool experience  anyway do we have an answer on that straw poll ziggurat okay then i think we have a pretty  solid background on this npc and where they can come into play im excited about this prospect  the last thing we /none/ need is a name you guys throw out some cool names ill pick out things that  reach me and well vote on which one we want the npc name to be so go ahead and throw your  suggestions in the chatroom for the name of this drow baker laugh no nope nope i know you  guys want to be funny and cute i want to try to make this also work within the story where it can  be taken seriously because certain names will not be taken seriously if theyre introduced in this  game and /none/ troy is definitely one of them well start with ruberick thats interesting miklos  miklos oh man theres a good one that passed by too fast zaloh man it went by too  fast curse you chat for being active no you guys are doing great lets do kryyn  kapostropheryyn noxtra noxtra is that four thats five all right so well go ahead  and throw those into the straw poll and you guys go ahead and jump in there and vote on the name  then from those names well pick those and from there well have an /none/ npc pretty much completed  that you guys helped create that will be introduced probably in this next arc of the game  so thatll be interesting im excited to see what comes out of this one laugh with that im  going to go have another sip of my drink rip troy its cute it was a really funny idea  guys but in the interest of wanting to keep the narrative realistic and because troys good  friends with a lot of us that would have made it a little weird  question from actiongordon bees yes or /none/ no if yes how many bees yes how many seven i  think bees are awesome bees are great theyre necessary we have a lot of bees in our backyard  theyre cute they land on me sometimes people get freaked out by bees thats fine i mean honey  bees fuck hornets and yellow jackets i hate them but bees are cool  question from leddle526 have you ever had a moment where you almost gave up being a dm  entirely giving up dm entirely giving up on a campaign almost actually the start of the  campaign /none/ i did before this one with my buddy zach hanks we were both codming this one and we had  a number of friends in there louie our buddy brian who looked like a dwarf and played a  dwarf and chloe dykstra some of you may know from some of her stuff she played saga the  rogue and then marisha came in eventually to be an assassin  but in that campaign the first couple sessions we had a guy and his wife playing with us who made  twins he was a paladin and i think she /tavern/ was a cleric and our first two sessions he got really  drunk very quickly and became unruly he became belligerent and was interrupting everybody else  making sexual jokes in the middle of other peoples turns and turned it into a him show and  it was not very respectful hes a nice guy but once he got drunk it was a problem so after two  games of that happening and the final one we were in the middle of a boss battle sequence a  very serious moment and he was yelling and making stupid jokes and /town/ fart noises and talking about how  he was going to attack with his dick and it wasnt even his turn were like buddy calm  down i could see his wife was embarrassed by it and i was like its all right finally during  somebody elses turn he jumped up and shouted something obscene i cant even remember knocked  his beer over all over the battle map and smeared all of the crowd so i said the wall begins to  collapse of the ceiling and unfortunately a portion of the cavern was in your direction as /none/  both of your characters are crushed as you escape and i killed off their characters i  apologized to her after but i was like i dont think this is going to fit and she is like i  understand no worries so he stopped playing in the campaign he felt bad about it but it was for  the best hes a great guy now his names andrew hes a really nice fellow but our styles of  gameplay didnt quite match and thats fine  thats the thing too theres so many different ways to play dd /none/ even critical role actually i  want to talk about this a little bit people keep saying critical role its the best example  there is for dd its not its really not its an example of dd its a way to play the  game its a way that we play because were actors and as actors were naturally more focused  on narrative and characterization and the drama of the element there our version of dd plays more  to the story than it does the rules per se as you can see some of the players havent /none/ locked in  all the rules sometimes but its because were more focused on other aspects of the game and  thats fine we still have a good time were an example of how it can play there are elements of  our game that you might like and take into your home campaign and there are a lot of people that  watch it that if they were to play in it would probably not enjoy it at all and there are a lot  of peopletrust me ive seen comments ive been tweeted people saying like your game /none/ looks like  shit i would never enjoy it and im like youre probably right and there are games out  there that people play that i probably wouldnt enjoy either but thats whats cool about it  theres so many different ways to play it theres so many different ways you can run it for the  players and all the styles are enjoyable for players that are looking for that type of  experience so yeah thats an example of andrew would be great at a table like a harmontown  type ridiculous drunkard debauchery table hed do /none/ great there for those of who are paying a  little more respect to the narrative and the intensity of a sequence didnt quite match up  very well and you both respectfully talk and go guys this isnt going to work out and thats  fine so keep that in mind  also for all you guys who are new to dd dont expect a critical role experience at your table  partially because once again were professional actors and weve been playing this for a long time  before we started the stream when we first started playing /none/ our first few games it was  nothing like this it was a lot of fumbling and what do i do they were all just learning how to  play and some games are a little more rules heavy the gamers and the dm are more involved in  the actual game aspect of it and thats rad ive had a lot of sessions like that before theyve  been a lot of fun too but you want to make sure you establish those boundaries and adjust your  expectations every game table is going to be different every experience /none/ you have at the table  is going to be different from what youve seen in my or the roleplay guys or acquisitions inc  or high rollers or any other great show all of them are different and unique because thats how  every table experience is playing dd thats part of what makes it so special so i ask you guys  dont get angry if your first or second dd game isnt like critical role because it cant be nor  could our game ever be like yours theyre wholly unique in their own right so abandon /none/ expectation  which by the way is a great term a great guide for life in general abandon expectation try and  move forward and do your best and that goes for your dd game as well so i recommend that  anyway do we have a name answer on this one kapostropheryyn so kryyn the drow baker  kryyn the drow baker whose interest is involving bringing tary home and they have a secret that  involves a ziggurat of some kind evil laugh good to know  starrybright brings up a question what do i think about the /none/ mcelroy boys and the show  adventure zone theyre phenomenal its a great show if you havent had a chance to see it the  podcast the adventure zone its great they run a dd game there i would say its a less serious  tone than critical role but they have serious moments as well they have a lot of dramatic  moments its a podcast form its a lot less rules heavy than ours which ours is not as rules  heavy as some other games so like i said its a spectrum but the adventure zones great /none/ the  mcelroys are fantastic travis is fantastic weve talked a bit online and im a big fan of what they  do so if you havent had the opportunity check it out i recommend it theyre fantastic and  they also do a great job of representing the importance of community and support others in the  community theyre generally rad people so highly recommend you check it out too  lets pick another question here id be curious to see some nondd related nonvoice over i  want to make this part of a conversation of just random /none/ shit also because i answer a lot of  questions on panels and stuff so if you have any burning questions about silly things or life  things we can get real im all for that if you want to make this almost a hearken back to the  honesty hours days of the early twitch stream im totally fine with that so be okay with going into  that regard  did you talk with any of the critical role guests about how they spent the year time skip from  scottyknows yes i did we actually met last /none/ night for about four or five hours going over all  that so thatll be coming up soon so look forward to that  oh wow its all exploding i saw someone ask triss or yennefer i was a triss girl until  witcher 3 and then i began to lean yennefer a little bit but i went back to triss im a triss  person through and through now i think i mean im marrying a redhead so i feel like im a  little biased yennefer was a love that was built by magical force that eventually blossomed /none/ into an  actual attraction if you play it right triss i felt was a genuine attraction that came  naturally so that to me was something very important so i think im a triss guy to answer  that i once said yennefer but thats changed since then as some things do  hughmillerc asks how do you want to do this with alcohol calranig asks can we see more  dwarves love their accent id love that i love the brogue its my favorite the scots style is  one of my favorite ones to do i enjoy /none/ it thoroughly across the spectrum of even soft scots  which is more of the casual conversational type i love that its got a nice almost poetic lilt to  it i love speaking in it i love hearing it i love it its my favorite way of doing it usually  when you think about dwarf you think more classic video game style and world of warcraft aye well  bring me to the orcs but for me the softer scot is more nice too the more refined and more  conversational type i love it so i would /none/ like to do that more but only if dwarves work in the  story and they are a threat in many circumstances  favorite animated movie i saw that go by real fast aw man does who framed roger rabbit count  its halfanimated im going to say it works because its one of my favorite movies of all  time and not only is it a technical achievement and a narrative achievement but such an amazing  cast one of the last big projects that mel blanc got to work on and actually do his warner brothers  characters /none/ its a perfect film in so many ways i love who framed roger rabbit and it should and  will never get remade because its one of those films that only worked in that era and could never  be made again so thats definitely it  someone asked about having another person become a permanent member of vox machina or the campaign  im going to say no to that i mean seven players is already a lot when ashleys not here even six  is a lot so i think were good were solid with this number six /none/ to seven players is good and  that gives us enough room to occasionally have a guest but i feel like stretching the attention a  bit and i do want to have guests on occasionally to add their narrative and to mix it up a little  bit but i dont think were going to bring another permanent member on in my opinion its a  lot to concentrate on and im already stretched thin as it is thank you for understanding  have i ever been charged with a crime no ive been interrogated by police this is /none/ a funny  story back in high school i was walking to my friend todd hunts house to go play rifts i had  my rifts character my binder my dice and everything in a bag he lived not that far from my  girlfriend of the time mira i would on the way walking to his house i was going to stop by and  say hi but she wasnt home apparently i walked up rang the doorbell nobody there i looked at  the window to see if anybody was home went up and looked at her bedroom /none/ window wasnt home so i  continued walking over to my friend todds place about five ten minutes later a bunch of cop cars  pulled up because apparently the cops were really bored in agoura hills they stopped me and they  were like hey so whats going on what are you wandering in this neighborhood for im like im  just going to visit my girlfriend but she wasnt home so im going to go to my friend todd oh  really whats in the bag im like my lord magus oc why so i hand them my /none/ character binder and my  dice  apparently i guess they got a call that there was a prowler with a bag of tools lurking around  the house one of the paranoid neighbors but i had the experience of them interrogating me over  my character sheet and asking if there were any drugs on my dice and like smelling and licking  them i was like come on guys really okay were good we good hes like yeah okay go  ahead thank you i grab my bag and i start walking on to my friend todds house /town/ hes like i  thought you were visiting the girlfriend its up the road right im like well i mean no one  was home so im a terrible i get nervous anyway so hes like huh well if thats true  ill drive you ill drive you to go see your girlfriend im like uh and i got really freaked  out because my girlfriends mom hated me at the time because i wasnt a doctor or from the middle  east she was lebanese so i was like oh god the last thing i want is to have /none/ the police show up at  the door with me and her moms there it would be terrible thankfully she wasnt and the cop  didnt really do it and everything was fine but that was my really nervous runin with the police  with my rifts game character there you go little story for you to take home ah boy  question am i going to dragoncon this year no and i dont know if ill ever be to dragoncon  again because unfortunately it happens at the same time as burning man every year i went back in /none/  2004 and 2005 where i cosplayed as dan hibiki and mugatu from the first zoolander because thats  what you do when youre at dragoncon had a great time but since burning man becomes a little more  of a creative and spiritual retreat for me every year that takes precedence so i dont know if  well ever get back unless they change the weekend but its a lot of fun i have a lot of  friends that go so have a good time  whats our little question nebuchadnezzar asks whats the story behind each of /none/ your bracelets  this is interesting i know people ive seen people make fun of the fact that i wear these  leather bracelets and its a fashion statement and it seems so douchey and rockstarlike to wear  and fair play this was the first one i got right here this was a magnetbased bracelet and i  received this actually at my first burning man this to me represents personal responsibility  and knowing where i come from i come from a bloodline of alcoholics my father also dealt with  drug addiction he was a musician in /none/ the 70s and 80s he went to narcotics anonymous for a while  im opening up here wonderful man i love him to death he was and is such a wonderful person  but he dealt with addiction issues and so knowing i was predisposed to all of this i  avoided alcohol i avoided anything i didnt even have my first drink until i was 23 i was so  scared that i was predisposed as i began to know myself better as a person in my life i decided i  felt that i wasnt possibly held by /none/ the same demons that my family before me did  so i tried alcohol and was like okay yeah this might be socially a thing but its not for me  and so id occasionally have a drink socially but it wasnt a big thing i felt that was a big thing  for me then my first burning man being surrounded by drug culture and having a lot of my  judgments on various experiences that i had friends who had and talked about and i was like  eh no no no that was my time to actually /none/ face those demons as well and so i had a number of  experiences at the burn that year with friends in a safe environment where i could try different  things safe things but so i could speak with these from a basis of understanding safe  hallucinogens and things like that in a very nice environment the end of that week i realized that  i really firmly understood that i was not bound by the same demons of addiction that my father did  and my grandfather before him i met a random person on my last /none/ day that week and we met at the  edge of the trash fence far out into the desert we talked for two hours and i told him all about  this history and they gave me this bracelet as a reminder that i overcame my familys demons and  as a reminder of the responsibility that i have to make sure that i stay true to myself and try and  help others to not befall those same traps so that was where i got my first bracelet and i wear  it all the time  the second /none/ one i got because marisha made it for me on our first anniversary she bought the  leather she dyed it herself she punched it and if you see in there a little bit you can see  coordinates that she pushed into the leather these coordinates are the coordinates on the earth  where we had our first kiss this was a beach on pch under the moonlight because weve got to be  cheesy and romantic and shit but she gave that to me as a reminder of that night and so this  bracelet to me is /none/ a reminder of her and so i keep that with me at all times  this one was given to me by my best friend brittany walloch who ive known for over ten  years shes been a dear friend confidante and helped me get through a lot of hard times and been  there for me i know its fucking cheesy but you asked guys sorry so this to me represents the  friends and the people that i have to support me and help me through the hard times and are  understanding when i get busy or /none/ get sad and so this one represents friendship to me  this one here was a gift from a critter during one of the critmases little tree of life on  there if you get a chance to see this was important to me because this represents you guys  this represents the community represents everyone who has come along with us on these adventures  the critical role and how you changed my life in so many wonderful ways so this i wear this all  the time because it reminds me of you guys and what were doing /dung/ in all this crazy silliness so  now you have the story behind my wrist bands probably the deepest explanation of them ive  given to date i may have said too much about myself but whatever thats what this afternoons  about there you go  all right the question how did you and marisha meet ill try to make this a lot quicker than the  last story me and marisha met through a mutual friend becky young who was an actress friend of  mine she played samus in my web series i did back in 20082009 /none/ called there will be brawl if you  havent seen it its silly liveaction film noir crime drama of the smash bros universe she was  doing improv and in one of her improv classes marisha had just started doing improv so they  became close friends and began doing scene work and sketches together then becky was going to  create a geeky sketch group for the internet she called in a bunch of her friends to be writers and  actors on it she called me in matt key and a few friends that she met through brawl /none/ then  brought marisha over from her improv  so we met at that first writing meeting and we both immediately crushed on each other but we  were both in other relationships and like nice to meet you that was you know we became loose  friends met at a couple social events over the next year or so but we you know we were this  distant aw if only but alas then about a year after that we reconnected after not seeing each  other for a while ill get to the tattoo in a minute i /none/ had gone in for a mocap audition and  they wanted to know if i knew any females who had dance experience martial arts experience i was  like marisha does so i got her an audition there and she called me to say thank you can i pay you  back with a drink some time id love to we never actually had a chance to hang out oneonone  before so we went and got a drink and talked four and a half hours and we clicked it was an  electric dinner everything was perfect i was /none/ like oh my god this is amazing i had been out  of my last relationship for about nine ten months at this time and spent a period of time being  single tried the dating thing and it was weird didnt like it and i was spending a lot of time  being solitary she was on the outskirts of a longterm relationship that had been dead in the  water for about six months according to her so we went our own ways about a week later she  called me and was like hey i just broke /none/ up with my boyfriend do you want to get a drink i need  to talk to somebody im like sure so we went out and got drinks again from there we began to  hang out more and it eventually turned into a romance and the rest is history now were getting  married in october which is crazy  anyway tattoo so this is my first tattoo right there this represents the art car of our burning  man camp the sensitron 5000 its a triangular metallic platform built on a truck bed that has a  large /none/ led umbrella that comes off the top of it its hard to describe if you do a search for  sensitron 5000 burning man you might see a picture of it theres these big colored silks  that hang off of it but anyway this tattoo is a geometric drawing of the art car and its a little  reminder of that little part of burning man home and a place where me and marisha have had many  great times together with a good camp family out there so thats what the tattoo means  now lets start getting /none/ onto the creature lets do some fun stuff here so for the creature for  the encounter who has more shoes me or marisha marisha i own like two pairs of shoes and  theyre both busted actually ones a little better i replaced it not too long ago but im  not a clothing shoe person these are the fanciest socks i own okay so for the monster encounter  for the first bit here i want to ask this creature what size do we want this creature to  be ill throw the ones out you guys dont /none/ have to put things in there because its a limited  course here ill go with tiny because what would be greater than a really powerful super tiny boss  fight medium large gargantuan and small so tiny small medium large and gargantuan i  think thats all no huge i missed huge so well do tiny medium large huge and  gargantuan i dont think we need to worry about small because if were going to go tiny go tiny  right so those are the five tiny medium large huge gargantuan well throw that in the straw  /dung/ poll and well see where that one ends up soon  now getting back to the questions here martyr85 asks when you get a rare chance to play is  there a personality trait you have that you purposely try to avoid while roleplaying i try  to avoid the batman persona kind of like im dark and broody and i know everything and im  badass and whenever anything story or emotional happens i dont care i dont want to play  drizzt dourden basically ive played with so many players over the years that all fall into  /none/ that archetype dont get me wrong i love drizzt as a character but that set up a precedent in the  late 90s and early 2000s that most guy gamers i gamed with tended to lean in that bruce willis  actionmoviestartype persona that got a little ridiculous for a while so i try and make things a  little more kooky i do try and make my characters after the rest of the party has so i can fill in  the gap im a support player i guess in that regard so ill wait for everyone else to /none/ choose  what they want and ill see whats missing and then ill go ahead and create something to fill  that space thats generally how i do it and i recommend you do it too it might force you into  some uncomfortable territory you might end up playing a class that you normally wouldnt have  chosen but realize that was actually pretty fun and a lot cooler than i thought it would be you  can learn a lot that way just saying  whatever happened to the aasimar kids well find out still in whitestone from /none/ what you guys know  which by the way theres a lot of npcs lot of npcs in this world i cant show them all all the  time when they become relevant theyll arrive or if the party searches for them theyll be there  maybe but theres a lot of characters that i put in this world as i realized over time and its  getting a little nuts so sorry if one of your favorites hasnt showed up in a while its a big  world vox machina can only cover so much ground at any given /none/ point in time sorry  actually do we have an answer on that one  offscreen tiny almost 99 percent  almost 99 percent tiny i love you guys so much im so excited for an extremely powerful tiny  beast im so excited for this oh my god oh i was hoping you were going to say that okay so  tiny creature now type creature type im going to have you guys throw some in the chat room  these include undead monstrous beast aberration construct any of the classic monster  manual creature types start throwing them /none/ into chat and ill start pulling out the ones that seem  to get more votes as we go  yeah fiends is one pixies fey well throw fey on there fey seems to have gotten a few votes  aberrations getting a bunch of votes as well constructs getting a lot of votes so weve got  fey aberration construct oh man a lot of that celestial im seeing celestial a lot in there  and well say elemental there we go those are some five interesting choices those are the ones  ive seen the most at least /none/ so there we go we have fey we have construct we have elemental we  have aberration and what was the last one celestial there we go so well get that straw  poll going and well figure out what that is here in a moment im going to go ahead and pour a  little port in here oh look at that fine fire that totally real fire its real dont judge me  i have not had a drink on a tuesday this early at least not a while that wasnt a margarita okay  so iamvirus asks /none/ skyrim or witcher 3 witcher 3 i love me some elder scrolls ive played them  all since arena but witcher 3 all the way im sayin deslog asks question wine whiskey or  vodka i would have said vodka years ago but ive come to enjoy whiskey more in recent years  that happens when your girlfriends from kentucky she brings bourbon into your life but even then  im not a heavy drinker so itll be like one drink itd probably be whiskey probably mixed  with something im a girly drinker i want sweet shit i can /none/ enjoy a nice straight harsh liquor as  a sipping drink but give me a mojito give me a margarita give me something nice and fruity and  sweet ill deal with the headache itll be fine  zzz195 asks how do you deal with rejection oh man not well at first i remember when i was in  seventh gradebecause i got rejected a loti had a very interesting upbringing or at least a very  interesting childhood i had a lot of asking girls out whenever i got the courage and them saying  yes on the spot /none/ and the next day going actually no and that sucked i had a pe  teacher named mr pickett who i just wouldnt get up and run the mile in seventh grade after a  girl turned me down a girl named i think it was jamie in choir chorus and he was like is it a  girl im like yeah he goes its okay man women are fickle which is a douchey thing to say  now in hindsight but at the time it helped pulled me out of my funk and he gave me a  dudetodude /none/ girl talk and i was like oh i feel better rejection sucks no matter what happens  but you have to remember rejection is not because you are a lesser person much like an audition  you just werent the right person dont take a rejection if its from an individual youre  asking out as an offense or that they dont want to have anything to do with you sometimes its  just youre not what im looking for i dont know you well enough and some great friendships  ive seen come out of rejection from multiple sides /none/ but there is a habit ive seen and a lot  of this nice guy syndrome happen online where its like i will be a friend to a girl and the  minute that i begin to ask her out and she says no then im like fuck her and its an  unhealthy behavior because youre missing opportunities for great friendship and two she  just wasnt into that aspect at least not now give her time to get to know you better or let it  blossom into a friendship and focus on somebody else who might be /none/ more your style as far as  career rejection keep focused on the next venture the more you obsess and concentrate on  any sort of rejection or falling out of a prospective path its hard but if you focus on  the next endeavor and try and be like okay that didnt work out what can i focus on now that  not only takes your mind off of it but it already gets you in a better direction focusing on whats  right and what could be the next venture  yeah i had a lot of interesting /none/ experiences as a kid actually i want to bring this up real fast  because i feel like its important i want to apologize legitimately to anybody who felt  uncomfortable in the story of the last taryon episode and the reveal there and i apologize if  that hit too close to home if that was not the representation of your story that you wanted seen  and i understand that it made a lot of people feel uncomfortable and im sorry im legitimately  sorry i put a post about it on twitter but text is easy to /none/ be misconstrued and you only have so  much brainspace to put out there and im sure ive been torn apart on the internet thats fine  i admit that however i do want to say that i think its an important story to tell from what we  understand of it and when i say what we understand of it yknow we all come from  different backgrounds and this is going to be a little real here for a second we have our  experiences to pull from when it comes to story we as actors we write /none/ and we only create from  experience and exandria is very much an open environment for the most part sexuality is an  open thing in society there are couples of all walks of life asexual trans nonbinary gay bi  everything and its all open in the world is the world free of ignorance no thats part of life  and part of the story because people are flawed people are stupid its minimized in my world  because i like to imagine a world where it is largely minimized but its not something thats  not going to /none/ exist and what little bit of tarys story weve touched on a lot of it improvised by  sam on the spot and a lot weve talked about since then and we developed a little bit  beforehand to an extent i think is an important story to tell and parts of it resonate ive had  people concerned that we were making fun of his awakening or his coming to terms with his venture  in the last episode and i can honestly say that if it came across that way im sorry that is not  the case /none/ we are very very sensitive to these things and many of us have lived very close to or  dealt with homophobia on our end as well i grew up a very androgynous longhaired pretty boy who  was quiet and god knows i spent a number of years of my youth being called faggot and being pushed  around and i have a lot of very very important people in my life who have dealt with far worse  and have undergone a lot of terrible circumstances and i feel for that a lot  my uncle ted for /none/ instance one of the most impactful people in my life probably at a young  age he was my dads brother he introduced me to musical theater he introduced me to andrew lloyd  webbers phantom of the opera we used to play piano and sing songs around the piano and stuff  and hes such a wonderful person and as a kid i loved him he was my favorite relative on that  side of the family he also dealt with the difficulty of being married and having a child  with his wife and then one day coming /none/ to terms with the fact that he was gay and it sundered a  lot of that part of the family at the time and it was very hard to be in parts of the family that  didnt understand that and even as a kid i knew what was wrong and what felt wrong and what was  being said and you know and then getting and then i had to watch him waste away over the years  because he caught hiv and then aids at a time when it was very prominent in the late 80s and /none/ early 90s  and then you know through the 90s in a lot of ways was very hard for people of alternative  sexualities because we didnt have communities we didnt have the internet we didnt have tumblr  we didnt have facebook there werent places you could go to feel safe if your lifestyle was  expected to be not the norm or not accepted so i had a lot of friends and a lot of close people  that had to just suffer inside and had nowhere to talk and occasionally meet somebody or find  somebody who /none/ was comfortable enough to be out and proud and then permission was given but even  that was met with a lot of difficulty im glad we live in a world now by comparison where things  are much more respected and its still a fight god its still a fight theres still so much to  be done and its still so much bullshit and so much disrespect and lack of empathy for people who  just want to be happy and that bothers me on a deep level and feel it really hard  but i know that /none/ parts of tarys tale may not be the representation that some people hoped for in  media but ive tried my best to represent other happier lives and things where that was an open  and viable circumstance tarys is important for people that grew up like maybe a lot of my friends  did and didnt have that open welcoming scenario and i cant believe im doing this on  the internet  anyway im sorry im doing the best i can and not all stories are going to be for everybody i  cant please everybody with all /none/ the choices we make and i mess up and i fail and i stumble and  even if a few people get offended i cant help but feel bad because i hate hurting people but i  promise im doing my best thats all you know when i said tarys experience his scenario at the  end of the last episode with trish reminded me of a lot of friends growing up you know every  person has a point in life where they struggle with their own identity and i had that too i  identify as heterosexual but /none/ ive had my years of curiosity ive had my years of trying to  figure out what it was who i was and yeah i myself am primarily attracted to women but there  are men that ive also found attractive in life mostly about the person the individual and  sometimes it takes an experience like what tary had to finally feel confident in that and not in  a judgmental way his was a little more comical because its sam and we want to play up the  discomfort of a sequence sometimes with humor to offset it /none/ but we try and treat it with respect  because a lot of it plays to elements of our own lives or people that are close to us and so  tarys journey is in some ways still a personal one for myself and other people in some ways so  just you know were trying  anyway wow that happened lets go to the next monster thing laughing jesus christ sighs so  tiny what type of monster we doing yo celestial tiny celestial encounter thats going  to be oh im good no pizza thank you i got /none/ popcorn and port yo and a fireplace what more  could you want  ability score focus what is this tiny celestial really good at were going to make this a six  choice a six choice straw poll here so were going to go ability scores of course strength  dexterity constitution intelligence wisdom charisma the classics i want to know what this  tiny celestial is really damn good at what is it really good at so were going to put that in  there have you guys vote and well see just how nasty this thing can /none/ be so pay attention to the  chat well have that up there in a moment were going to go ahead and do some more questions and  ill keep it together going forward laughs  talisar question how excited are you for the new bill nye show i actually watched a few  episodes of it im conflicted i love bill nye and i grew up loving bill nye and im a firm  believer in everything he has to say i think in some ways were entering this weird era that is  undermining intellectualism and fact and /none/ its really frustrating and i think hes been a great  beacon for that in public spheres  the tone of his show is a little strange because i feel like its a little preaching to the choir so  far i feel like it would be a better message to try and have the show presented in a way that is  speaking to the other side and explaining why its important to listen to what the facts or what the  science is the show so far from what ive seen comes across a little preachy and a /none/ little  condescending to those who many not believe and i dont think that necessarily befits his argument  in the best way its still a great show and im liking it so far but that would be my one  critique on it is that it comes across a little selfrighteous in a way that might turn off the  people who really should be listening to it and learning from it otherwise it turns into an echo  chamber but im excited to check out the rest of it and hope that that picks up a little bit /none/ and i  love everything hes done in the past i think its important that we have more figures like that  that are both public figures like neil degrasse tyson and bill nye that are champions of science  champions of reason champions of fact and im excited to see more of that type of content ill  see more of it  i will say the new mystery science theater is fucking awesome as a person who grew up watching  the original comedy central run when i was a kid when i first moved out to california /none/ im a joel  guy i love mike but joel is my guy all the way and ive watched every episode i was so scared  for the reboot so scared because it could have gone wrong in so many ways i legitimately teared  up multiple times watching the first episode of the new netflix show because it felt like the old  show to me i was so excited even the final credits sequence they even have a new version of  the old sad orchestral version of the mst3k theme and i was just tears and smiling /none/ i tend to cry a  lot im a sensitive boy if you havent figured that out by now  ability score focus do we have an answer on that yet what is it charisma thisll be interesting  okay lets do three focuses here this will be combatfocus for the creature so its a tiny  celestial charismabased entity do we want it to be meleefocused not meelee im trying to be  better about that i grew up saying meelee and its an old habit hard to break i know its  melee im trying guys i know /none/ it bothers a lot of you melee rangedfocused or spellfocused  or you know what environmentfocused so it might get in the fray with people it might attack them  from a distance it might do a spell caster type or focused on using the environment to its  advantage well throw those choices up in the poll and well see what that one comes out to in a  moment  an hour and a half goes fast guys thanks for chilling as long as you have and watch me be  ridiculous on camera with you for a /none/ while scrubsfan06 asks a question whats your favorite  band oh thats a tough one my father was a musician i was raised on the beatles moody  blues steely dan al parsons project so i come from that background then i was also introduced  more to modern bands i say modern i was a kid of the 90s like stone temple pilots type o  negative love type o negative great pseudoalmostnotserious goth rock its  beautiful but i think the musician thats affected me the most would be mike patton and his  work on mr bungle /none/ many other musical projects that are fantastic fantomas tomahawk lovage  some of his solo stuff but his work on mr bungle is so avantgarde and strange and changed my  perspective on music and vocals gogol bordello is a great choice too gogol bordello is fantastic  mike pattons work has been heavily inspiring in so many ways hes probably the closest i have as  far as a vocal match when it comes to music so if theres anybody i can sing along with in the car  mr bungle im right there i have a secret dream /none/ that ever i end up with too much time on my hands  that ill do a mr bungle tribute band and do a show once in the roxie just for my friends i want  to do that one day will it ever happen i dont know mike pattons my boy  straw polls up guys you got to vote lolkeegan says matt kind of stagnant in life with no  direction do you have any friends or were you yourself like that how did you find your  direction and motivation or whatever yeah a number of times /none/ thats not an uncommon  experience if anything take solace in the fact that all of us eventually find ourself there at  some point or another before i went to burning man i was in that place out of school i was in  that place right before i met marisha to a certain extent i was in that place too change  of scenery helps more than anything being stuck stagnant and being in a place of comfort that is  affiliated with that stagnation in my opinion can be a very stifling atmosphere without  realizing it /none/ i recommend taking a drive by yourself just drive if youre near a coast up  the coast and find a bit of beach to sit and think for a few hours on your own bring some snacks  bring some wine or go into the desert or go into the woods and commune with your surroundings go  to a place thats outside of whats normal and comfortable to you both to force yourself out of  your comfort zone but to put you in a space where you can start thinking outside of the way you  normally /none/ do i cant say thats a guaranteed answer but that can begin to help with forcing  you to think outside of the normal woe is me i cant do anything i cant change anything  youve already changed one thing youve changed your scenery youve already discovered a new  place that you can go to for solace a place you can bring a friend once you have these moments to  think to yourself maybe try a hobby youve always wanted to and never gave yourself the gumption to  do it you were always like ive always /none/ wanted to try sculpting do it buy some clay look on  youtube theres so many great tutorials for anything you could ever want to do ever period  on the internet now buy some clay and start sculpting in your house or go to a class if  theres one nearby that you can afford do some life drawing something artistic something  creative something that spurs the brain outside of the numbers and the mathematics that may be  enough of a change of your normal way of thinking that it might inspire different directions to  look /none/ it might lead your right on the path or put you in that direction theres no guarantee  theres no right answer to this but thats something thats worked for me and its worked for  some people i know at least it might be a start wish i had better answers for you but i hope that  helps  whats the answer on the straw poll environment not going to lie i was hoping you were going to  say that thats going to be a fun fucked up battle okay and last but not least lets get /none/ a  name whatever cool first names come out of the chat ill start pulling them and well put them in  with a straw poll based off that dont be offended if i dont pick yours im going to grab  ones that seem interesting and throw them up there look here for a second you guys throw the  chaos at me lets do kaeora lets do balkanus yort exelon ooh i like  that one symphior symphony but symphior going celestial here folks leth apostrophe  ess symphior i think it was symphony symphior and well put /none/ that in i hope  thats right if its not thats what it is now well get that started and well start pouring  through some answers on that well see what names comes to congratulations oh man ive already  got some ideas on this one these might not appear very soon in the arc but theyre going to be  worked into the arc itll be a surprise to you guys as it will be for the players when they come  and well work this out should be fun  we got about 20 minutes here i /none/ want to get some more questions what instrument would you play  from kosawankenobi funny my father a musician played many instruments i got a lot of  instruments for christmas over the years messed them for a day lost interest and gave them to my  little brother who then became the musician he plays trumpet trombone guitar drums piano  everything im bookended by extremely talented musicians and all i do is sing im a little  sheepish about instruments im a decent drummer in rock band i hover in that hard to expert  level or at /none/ least i was in my heyday ive gotten a little rusty since then im sure but if i  could play like really play id probably go any instrument violin i love the violin its  such a beautiful instrument such a beautiful sound that can evoke so many rich emotions you  can tell a story through just a note ive had my heart tugged on and smashed and uplifted by just a  single solo violin piece its a beautiful instrument and it takes a lot of practice anyone  out there who plays violin all the power /none/ to you all the love i dont have the time maybe one  day maybe in my retirement ill learn to play the violin but thats definitely my favorite  instrument of all  kungfupanzer asks how is this date going are we going to see each other again does marisha mind  i think its a great probably going great until i emotionally spilled all over you thats when  you retract and go okay this guys a bit much hes got some baggage well be good friends and  well probably hang out and get drinks and ill /tavern/ introduce you to marisha well all go out and  wander the cia bar of north hollywood probably and drink over a dead clown under a glass thats a  real phrase about a real thing you should look it up its terrifying  buttassbooty said did you ever mow your lawn i did i said that earlier but i wanted to say your  name out loud so there you go congratulations question do i like camping from asimilie i love  camping i love it so much i dont get to go anywhere near as often as id /none/ like i think were  trying to plan a vox machina group camping trip as soon as we all get time because we all have wanted  to do that for a long time trying to find a weekend thatll work i love camping i went a lot  with my family wed go up to mount whitney through all the mountain ranges up through big  sur yeah camping was great my mom was hilarious she loved to camp but she also loved  some amenities she was the only person i knew who would get up in the /none/ morning and heat up her  curling iron in the campfire to do her hair while camping my mom i love her to death thats a  memory i will always hold dear in my heart crouched down dirty heating up her curling iron  thats awesome  interesting other questions what music are you listening to at the moment from pwnagepanda a  lot of chvrches as youve probably seen from the shirt every single tiny trickle of lorde that  comes out i obsess over and latch onto right now good edm i enjoy as a good general /none/ creative  space i say good edm because theres a lot of shitty edm i briefly fell in love with the  chainsmokers then quickly fell out of love with them after seeing interviews with the douchebros  that are them good edm i really enjoy classic radiohead never dies paranoid android era was  fantastic spotifys allowed me go back and listen to a lot of old songs from my teen years that i  hadnt had access to in awhile so thats pretty rad we got really heavily into chvrches right  around the time me and marisha /tavern/ got engaged so chvrches has been our happy theme for a while the  most recent album thats a recurring theme with us recently  favorite sweet alcoholic beverage from aquajolt if were going dancing and i dont want  to spend a lot of time drinking or spend a lot of money on multiple drinks ill get a long island  iced tea because you just need one and it gets the job done and youre ready to go dancing if its  more of a casual conversation if were all at a small dive bar talking for hours /none/ ill probably  get a kentucky mule some bourbon ginger beer little bit of lime and sip on that for a while  those are probably my two current favorites utility purposes different definitely  question worst video game ive ever played by timmy32 oh man there are some bad games but  theyre known to be bad i worked on some bad games i worked on a whole bunch of shrek titles  my job before becoming a voice actor i worked in qa in game development side then worked into  producing in game development i worked at /none/ a company tdk media active for a number of years and  made shrek licensed products that were terrible shrek party mario party ripoff but it was  shrekrelated that was really bad oh man there were some really bad games fallout brotherhood  of steel the turnbased rts tried to make as a fallout fan who loved fallout one and two broke my  heart because it was not a good game for me having a broken game is terrible but having a  broken game with a great license is even more painful that really kills me  /none/ houndrider9000s question ever consider short hair yes i dont look good with it i dont  think so not for me long hairs been my thing for most of my life longish ive gone through  stages youve seen it shorter sometimes on the show yeah i cut it a little shorter and it  eventually grows out i just dont look good with short hair i feel cold and naked and alone if  its too short i dont like it so my hair will probably be some degree of longish or at least  ragged i guess  /none/ zenez8 says favorite voice line and what one bugs marisha the most favorite voice line it is  a gift it is an absolute blessing that i have been given a catchphrase in mccree im going to  have it with me the rest of my days as much as people might be like oh my god hes so annoyed  to have to say its high noon all the time its like no thats fantastic im always happy  to say it if someones very respectful about it and not be like hey matt what time is it id /none/  be like all right dude relax thats wonderful thats a catchphrase very few people get that so  i love it im really excited that i have that that would probably be the most iconic quote that  i have character line bothers marisha the most any of the maccready postromance wakeup lines  from fallout 4 well wake up in the morning suns coming through our blinds in the bedroom and  shes starting to wake up and ill lean over and be like maccready voice so are you ready to face  the day normal voice and /none/ shell punch me rightfully so ill give her shit about that every  now and then laughs  playgratchansee question is any tips on how to deal with players who fight over items and gold  talk to them and say guys seriously you need to work this out otherwise were not going to  play be respectful and figure this out if theres still a problem maybe have them encounter  some sort of extremely powerful archfey entity that is true neutral and really feels everything  should be fair and has found interest in them and follows them /none/ silently invisibly if at any point  they start fighting over loot threatens them with complete and utter destruction so be fair and  place nice otherwise the fey will destroy and consume you find story reasons to fuck with them  and force them to play nice too laughs cursed items also a great deal that really greedy guy  who keeps grabbing everything throw him a couple of cursed items and let him deal oh man you  took that first put it on oh no youre withering good on you for that chat thats  another great /none/ suggestion communist fey yes exactly  question star wars or star trek and why interesting question i grew up loving fantasy  high fantasys my jam i should love star wars as much as the next person i enjoy star wars and i  watch the trilogy a lot but i wasnt into it as a lot of kids i knew i used to have all the toys  the bedsheets everything but i was a tolkien kid for me it was either high fantasy or high  fantasy in space to me i leaned more high fantasy but i /none/ love the original trilogy and i  watched it a bunch as a kid too when i got into star trek right around the next generation era  when that first came out that was so radically different than anything i had gotten into that i  immediately leaned towards that so my very realistic scifi star trek utopian society the  future exploring the cosmos in a very colonizing harmonytype way was so radically different than  any other scifi i had experienced outside of asimov and arthur c clarke books i had grown up with  that i /none/ fell in love with that i definitely started more as a star trek person ive come to  enjoy star wars more as the years go on but i think star trek had more of an impact on my youth  i had lord of the rings as more of my fantasy and star trek as more of my scifi star wars is in  the middle i adhered to the two extremes if that makes sense dont hate me on the internet too  late  phalanx66 question new tattoo i do have some new ideas when the campaign /none/ guide is over and out  there im going to talk with marisha i havent decided yet but im thinking about getting the  outline of taldorei tattooed on my back just the outline of the continent and with each campaign  guide if they keep happening ill add more continents until eventually i have all of exandria  on my back as just outlines its an idea ive had an idea dont know if its going to happen  but you know that was something that came up  favorite action movie character hudson hawk if you dont know /none/ who that is you should watch it  its ridiculous laughs nerd i know i know and i own it i should favorite doctor from  doctor who from fireknight7 oh weve got ten minutes left thank you for the reminder favorite  doctor i grew up on baker so he was my introduction to the world doctor who was  originally that weird british show that came on at 500am when id couldnt sleep or woke up way too  early as a kid id watch and be like i dont know whats happening but this is weird and /none/  awesome so that was my introduction to doctor who was through baker who was a great doctor love  his personality his whimsy is great it wasnt until the reboot that it came back that i got back  into it and tennant won me over then its a close match between baker and tennant but i think  tennant just wins out because he ran the gamut especially towards the end of his run the fury  the warrior doctor elements coming through his sorrow his loss i cant watch his final walk to  the tardis after /none/ he takes irradiation right before his regeneration without becoming a blubbering  absence of nonsad emotion i am an absolute mess mark humes actually from high rollers when i  was london years ago i dragged him to the doctor who museum because he hates doctor who i was  like youre coming with you because youre my host he hated it the whole time it was me and  him and a bunch of kids and it was amazing they had the actual tardis console of the tennantera  tardis and it was all busted up and i was /none/ like cool this is the console and i hear this music  and i was like wheres the music coming from its really sad thats really familiar i look  over and im like thats the song of the ood and they have a big screen that had tennant  walking through the snow slowly making his way to the tardis and i start bawling i watched the  whole sequence of them saying i dont want to go tears everywhere and im blubbering heaving  sobbing grown man in the middle of a doctor who museum a bunch of /town/ kids who are confused and mark  with his arms crossed going fucking hell mate it was amazing ive dragged that guy through some  shit laughs  im trying to get through some of these questions because we have to close this up soon favorite  nonrpg game by acetamichelle thats hard almost all the games i like are rpgs street  fighter actually not that hard at all street fighter i grew up playing street fighter  hardcore for a brief time i did tournament street fighter and i can still hold my own pretty  decently in /town/ street fighter there was a time i was super intense about it i got really good my  prime of my life was during the alpha three era alpha three is still to this day my game i got  really deeply into street fighter not just the competitive aspect but the lore there is street  fighter lore its confusing contradicts itself a lot but i got really into it i owned a lot of  japaneseimport art books about it that i could only get in little tokyo or order online at the  time off ebay i /town/ did kuma for halloween one year ive done dan hibiki multiple times i learned a  lot of the japanese phrases most japanese i learned which is very little i learned from  fighting games mostly street fighter so if i ever go to japan all i can really do is get into  fights not as useful but that it is what it is street fighter guy all the way  lets get to some more of these questions at the bottom oh man ghostlymuse question for players  who want to have more variety are there any resources /none/ youd recommend for learning accents  yes watch the new episode of signal boost to have liam obrien boost exactly what im about to tell  you but the idea the international dialects of english archive is a fantastic free website that  has recordings of people from all over the world in all different countries speaking in english  reading a story that has all the phonetics and vowels and all of the different ways you can say  and pronounce things as part of its construct and then they talk about themselves but its a great  resource /none/ for listening and learning dialects and accents from all over the world if youre good at  picking them up by ear otherwise you might have to study a little more and get involved in the  ipa which is the international phonetic alphabet thats a little more of an investment and probably  more if youre going to go into acting but the idea is a great resource recommend it  zipknoll best dream you ever had that i can say on air best dream only because it was so vivid  it wasnt a good dream it was /dung/ a nightmare but it was so vivid and it was so i wrote a short story  about it in high school and i dont know where it went but i had a dream that i was walking home  from school this was in high school and the entire sky was a roiling gray cloudy mass it was  dark and ominous it was shifting and moving occasionally youd see a skull shape emerge out  of it or a giant skeletal hand reach out of it and then retract into the sky and there was a  sense /none/ everyone understood that something very bad was going to happen so i went home with my  family my mom and i was like whats going on outside and she goes have you seen the news  and when you look at the news and as i look over the monitor i see this big mountain that was  visible from our house this giant slowly retracting funnel was making its way down not in  a massive tornado way but it was slowly descending from the sky like it had deliberate  intent to land  when you looked /none/ at the news over in japan of course japan because thats where all cataclysms  start apparently this giant obsidian orb a mile in diameter apparated it was smooth and they had  the whole you know a bunch of different military forces were brought there to look at it no one  knew what it did then one day a door beneath it opened it sat there for a week and everyone was  like what does this mean clouds are there this is happening but nothings going on and  then suddenly we watch as this door retracted /none/ from beneath and opened and multitudes of these  demonic spirits begin to spill out thousands upon thousands upon thousands of them they all looked  like devilish entities but they were spectral they couldnt be harmed they passed through all  physical matter they didnt attack anyone but what we began to discover was each one of these  spiritual entities had one corresponding person in the world that it knew where they were and was  going right for them and whenever it found them it embraced the person and they died so it was  this extermination /none/ of the human race each one of these demonic spirits designed to find the one  person that they were designed for to eliminate them and it was this wave as it went across all  of asia to europe and then made their way into the us and the rest of the dream was us waiting for  this to happen it was this very ominous acceptance of the end and looking out and seeing  these waves of entities coming over the mountain that i started the dream with and then coming  through the valley through the /dung/ neighborhood and coming towards us and thats the last point i  remember dark as fuck dream and i apologize for that but it was so vivid the imagery to me that  i filled my sketchbook and i began to write a story about it and the imagery inspired me in  certain ways so that was probably one of my favorite dreams but not one of the best dreams  but one of my favorites  okay were having to close this up here because were getting to the end of the six oclock period  here you /none/ guys are awesome thank you so much for coming and hanging out today we ran a gamut of  emotions thoughts and we created a couple of npcs and monsters this was a promise from a charity  game a while back so thank you for being patient with that were getting things geared up again  but we appreciate you guys so much thank you listening hanging with me hanging with my  awesome fake fire and i hope you have yourself a wonderful day ill see you guys thursday for the  continuation of vox machinas adventures and
