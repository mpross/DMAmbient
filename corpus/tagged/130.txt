dung	 hi my name is matthew mercer im a voice actor and the dungeon master for geek  sundrys  critical role and welcome to this fun video series about tips and tricks for game masters and  dungeon masters alike today im doing an faq because i get a lot of questions often over and  over again and while id like to answer as often as possible it might be easier to put this up as  a video and answer some of them for the foreseeable future  theme music  number one is your critical role story 
none	 a homebrew yes i created it from the ground up  for better for worse and im still developing it as we continue playing the game i did borrow the  dawn war pantheon for it as it was a memorable and relatable pantheon but there are some  carriedover gods from pathfinder because its where we began the campaign in pathfinder then  converted over to 5th edition partway through its all homebrew and if time allows me in the  future maybe ill put something out for you guys if you want to play around in exandria so 
none	 fingers crossed  number two i see you looking in your app a lot for reference during the game what app do you  use i use fight club 5 on ios its a free software it requires a little bit of jiggering to  get it to work you have to download some files from certain websites and then upload it through  dropbox onto the actual app so its a little involved with the getgo and you have to do some  research on google to find out how to actually do it but its an extremely helpful 
none	 resource for  quick reference to spells you can bookmark spells creatures abilities see classes and  racial feats its great so thats been very helpful to me  how do you make your maps i start with oneinchgrid easel paper you can get these giant  pads of oneinchgrid easel paper on amazoncom those are great because you can just go ahead and  tear them off theyre semitransparent and then i go ahead and get some crayola markers and some  colored pencils and i build from there i usually sketch out on a small scale first just 
none	 to get the  feel for how the battlefield will look and flow and then i draw the larger version and fill it out  and use that for the actual game but theres a lot of great software online that you can create  maps with you can do things like photoshop campaign cartographer and if you play online for  roll20 there are a lot of great software in those communities that you can ask about that that help  you build your own maps to look really awesome and professional too so look into that  where 
dung	 do you find or how do you make your playlists for your game i make them on itunes and  i pull from many tracks mine currently are made up from tracks from platemail games which has a  lot of cool atmospheric and thematic tracks for locations and terrain i use midnight syndicate  has a lot of great tracks incompetech from kevin macleod has a lot of great tracks and all those  are royaltyfree meaning these are kind of the only ones we were able to use when we started the  stream since then ive gotten 
none	 permission to use the soundtrack from the pc game pillars of  eternity ive gotten permission to use the elder scrolls series soundtrack from bethesda and those  have all been really cool you guys wont have to worry about that if youre doing home games you  can use any music you want you dont have those limitations but i highly recommend any of those  you can pull soundtracks from conan the barbarian you can pull in final fantasy tracks if you want  to anything you want to but what i do is i break them down 
town	 into playlists and each playlist is a  certain mood or location so i have a playlist for small battles one for big battles one for boss  battles i have a playlist for creepy i have a playlist for really creepy areas i have a  playlist for a mysterious scenario i have playlists when its peaceful i have playlists for  when you are in a town playlists when you are in a tavern that way its just really easy for me  to just click any one of these playlists for a specific moment it takes a 
dung	 little bit of setup  and its a lot of time put into it to make sure you have that layout but once you have it as a  dungeon master or as a game master its really easy to go ahead and switch pretty quickly based  on how the scenarios mood and dynamic has changed  can i use or incorporate your characters or parts of your world in my campaign sure yes please go  for it i find it flattering i think its awesome that you would want to have tieins or elements of  your 
town	 game crossed over to ours just be aware that players actions in our game can sometimes change  the world so if you want to be playing alongside our campaign theres always a chance that things  can get weird down the road so be prepared if you want to keep it consistent at least make  things weird on your end as well i dont know depends what the players do but if time ever  allows i would love to make a sourcebook so well see if thats ever a possibility if time  lets me how can 
dung	 i improve my skills as a gm or a dungeon master first and foremost its not  necessary but its so helpful improv classes you dont have to want to be a performer or an  actor to take improv its helpful in so many facets of your life just the idea of quick  thinking of being able to yes and and work with other people to make fast decisions and listen  very well and to be able to adjust on the fly its helpful in everything from business to social  dynamics to so many things but 
dung	 it tremendously helps for dungeonmastering or gamemastering your  role playing game also you can look online for great blogs from other dungeon masters if you can  find it id recommend looking up chris perkins dm experience blog for episodes you can find  them still i think theres some good stuff on there you can also look at a lot of the really  great realplay shows that are online like rocknroleplay and probably some acquisitions  inc stuff that chris perkins himself did at pax or you could watch critical role but you can find  a 
dung	 lot of cool little tricks and interesting techniques that different dungeon masters use to  make their games immersive and everyones different everyone has their own method everyone  has their really cool thing they do so watching them all you can pick and choose and build your own  cool method  final question for this faq how does this random rule or feature work in dd google google is  your friend i know a lot of the rules in the game but there are also some that im even fuzzy  on if you have any questions
