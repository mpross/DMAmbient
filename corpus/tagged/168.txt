matt you guys have been amazing this is amazing well be playing this for the next three hours  come hang with us let me meet you over at my table  travis hes got to run into the other studio hes got to take the elevator down to studio oh hey  liam how did you get there so fast  matt magic dungeon master magic although however im not a dungeon master today /none/ today i  am a marshal  laura drawling well all right  matt because were playing deadlands reloaded for those of you who arent familiar deadlands is  one of my favorite settings called the weird west and were playing deadlands reloaded which  brings it over into the savage worlds system which ive had to learn over the past few days so  bear with us its going to be a rusty run for a lot of us learning and picking up things well  probably going to get a shitton of things wrong and thats okay because /none/ were going to have fun  while doing it anyway were playing deadlands and to give you guys the idea behind the world  that were playing in this takes place in the 19th century around 1864 an event called the  reckoning transpired what had happened is as the people of america began to push further west  pushing a lot of the native americans out of their land and a bunch of terrible things happened to  their people and their tribes a number of disgruntled shamans and members of those tribes  came together and essentially did /dung/ a giant shamanic ritual to tear a hole between this world and this  extraplanar world of dark magic introducing entities called reckoners that want to pass into  this world and can they only do so by elevating fear into this world it also introduced magic it  introduced a bunch of really weird creepy things into the old west causing the civil war to run  longer than it did in history as well as a bunch of other ridiculous circumstances nevertheless  that is the setting that this game will take place in before we get started /none/ i want to go over a few  rules for you guys so you know what this charity stream is all about we have some cool things  called fate chips which ill get into here in a minute the fate chips players and myself can use  to alter the circumstances in the game a black fate chip sorry for those of you who know the  rules i didnt have any white chips but they work the same as white chips the black fate  chips can be spent by players to reroll a single trait or skill /none/ roll theyre attempting to do its  a onetime reroll the red chips can be used to instead add a d6 to whatever trait or skill roll  they just made but in using that red chip i get to pick one to add to my pool over here as the  marshal a blue chip which is probably the strongest of them all allows them to add that  same d6 to a trait or skill roll but i dont get to pick a chip out of there thats pretty cool  for them however some of my more /none/ powerful creatures or individuals in the game may have  their own set of fate chips and if you donate looking at the list you can go ahead and provide  additional fate chips to the players or me  travis dont buy him shit  laughter  laura or do donate buy him whatever you want  matt stack the deck however you feel it needs to be stacked trust me on this one  liam do we start out with one of each is that correct  matt you start with three of each were going to get /none/ to that here in a moment  liam theyre also delicious  travis dont jump the dramatic pause gun liam  groans laughs  travis man en fuego  donation music  matt so as it stands if people want to donate and affect the game you can donate a hundred  bucks to give one of the players a black fate chip you can donate 150 to donate a red fate  chip to a player of your choice 200 to give a blue fate chip to the player of your choice or  200 to give me a /none/ fate chip of my choice to use against the players  laura why do you get to  matt because im the marshal i make the rules  marisha is there ever going to be a situation where youre like you know what a black chip  will suffice thisll be fine  matt possibly sometimes the rolls can be better than additional ones well see  liam matt i would like to point out that the chat has typed the words high noon about 72000  times in almost five minutes  matt i can only assume so  /none/ laura if you donate 500 matt will say high noon whenever you want laughs im sorry  matt what have you done what have you done laura in our final tier for this donating section  of this wonderful drive is if you donate 500 or more you get to add a singlesentence element to  the story currently and the moment it comes into play it will be incorporated to and adjust the  current moment of the storys narrative based on your suggestion there try and be somewhat  respectful with that weve had some crazy things happen /none/ in the past that completely derailed the  game and that was fine for our extra life game which was crazy to begin with this one if its  a little crazy i may tweak it a little bit to fit into the narrative because i have to try and fit  it somehow but im going to try to facilitate to the best of my ability everything you guys suggest  liam please dont break the universe  matt yeah no deck of many things in this please that is the tier system we have in here  for /none/ this to begin this circumstance  laura im so nervous  matt well actually before

character took /none/ one of the edges  called veteran of the weird west which gave her some great opportunities shes a more seasoned  character than the rest of them shes seen more about the world

carriage as the four of you are currently riding  to your destination for your different purposes and different reasons which you may discuss at  your own leisure or not or make up at your own leisure or not the four of you have been  traveling for days in this hot humid muggy carriage to /dung/ your final destination of deadwood  south dakota  liam singing sweet little light of mine im going to let it shine  matt founded in the deadwood gulch at the discovery of gold by an expedition by custer in  1874 they had to abandon the governments incursion to seize these gold veins when the  effects of the reckoning and the ensuing quakes began to swell in the western regions of the  united states but word of the rich veins still found their way to the public ears here and there  and folks seeking quick money /town/ and an escape from the mounting chaos of the stilldragging civil war  swarmed into the gulch to raise up this lawless city of gold sin and vice managing to be far  enough away from politics rumors still find their way to this rugged town of strange goingson in  the world tales of slain yankee and southern soldiers rising from the muck postbattle of  shadows moving in the night to steal children of mystics calling spirits to do their bidding even  so the people of deadwood are toughened already by harsh untrusting reality and such folk /none/ tales  have no place in a mans world the sun has just set as the denizens of deadwood scatter to the  bars to get shitfaced  loud bang offscreen  matt everybody down all right that totally distracted me you all sit after arriving  exhausted and tired from your journey within the city of deadwood finding yourself at the  immediate display of the first place that comes to your eyes and seeking rest and an escape from the  worries of the world you all step into and relax in the bella union saloon  marisha /none/ ooh the bella union  matt already got one  offscreen oh several  matt oh no  laughter  matt its already

distance as the bella union is beginning to come  to life again you can hear a piano playing and some laughter you hear some loud carousing on the  other side of your door to the inn the second floor of which you now currently are awakening  travis i do hate to trouble /none/ you does anyone see the chamberpot in the room i am afraid i have a  rather need  laura lean your shit out the window

need to take a walk and do a little thinking see you later  matt as you guys step out at your own individual pace you pass by a gentleman whos on the  secondfloor balcony staring down into the main thoroughfare of the bella union  donation prompt all right  matt a dark maroon coat and pants short greyish hair an intense dark mustache and a  very very angular face he looks angrily down amongst the people and you can see at the tables  the gambling tables are /none/ alight this early in the day and there appears to be a very intense game  of cards going on and people are gathering around looking to see what the next stage is  going to be during this game you guys go down to find yourselves a drink  laura shit i want to watch the game  matt drinks first or game first  laura drink and then watch the game because i really want to see the game fast fast give me  some whiskey  matt all right you guys each throw a dollar down you /tavern/ go ahead and get yourself a very fine  pouring

as you guys begin to gather around this poker game you look down and you can see folks  are tense and looking over theyre starting to cheer some folks are making their own side bets  off the circumstance the visible layer of tobacco smoke is beginning to cloud the upper atmosphere  of the bella union its very palpable at this point looking /none/ in you can see four men at a table  that are all very intent and one gentleman whos very well dressed similar in fashion to you a  very nice light gray suit a very welltrimmed goatee balding on top with very shortcut hair  on the sides and a little pair of spectacles at the end of his nose hes looking at his cards  with a big smile everyone starts putting the last of their bets into the center  laura whats the other guy look like  matt there are two other gentlemen you can see /town/ that both look greasy like they havent really  slept in a long while covered in dirt and crud but they seem to have a large cache of chips at  their side probably some of the various claim workers out here outside of the town and you see  one of the gentlemen is wearing a top hat similar to the one that youre wearing with a fine long  mustache handlebar out a portly older gentleman looking at his hand oh hell im  going in  laura hes bluffing that ones bluffing  donation prompt all right /none/  matt one of them goes all right and pushes in  laughter  travis two of them are in two of the three  matt the inspiration of seeing all this energy you being away inspires you to go ahead have  yourself another black chip you guys watch as suddenly they all throw their cards down full house  pair of queens got a bunch of different cards and all of a sudden it comes to the welldressed  character who looks a little nervous now and goes hmm straight flush and everyone goes  big upset loud /none/ uproar you can see now as the guy with the long mustache goes oh hell throws  his cards down and gets up from the table angrily and turns around to walk away the two other  gentlemen at the table glance out the side of their eye as one of the guys you see at the edge  of this table game an older hunchedover gentleman with glasses at the end of his nose and  a smearing of black powder across his face goes i love poker its the most crazy game ever  laughter  matt do /none/ that it makes no sense at which point one of the guys at the table goes youre  right it doesnt make sense this guys a cheater we have a goddamn fucking cheater here  laura thats right hes a fucking cheater i can tell  travis i dont think so i believe he had what they call the nuts  matt thank you very much that man knows what hes talking about im not cheating youve seen  me play cards in front of you this has been an amazing game  laura look up his sleeves that ones /none/ cheating  matt at which point you can see one of the guys who lost in the game immediately goes for a  swinging punch towards the guy holding the who won the actual last pot and with that whack  cracks it right across his face  donation prompt all right  matt all right he says as he punches him down suddenly a giant brawl begins to emerge in the  center of this room you can see people throwing hooks left and right the guy who currently won  the game is trying to grab the chips /none/ he has off to the side as you can see the two guys at the front  of the guard of the bella union rushing in and trying to hold folks down  marisha while the brawl breaks out sudis starts trying to palm a few coins  laura i jump in the fight  marisha oh no oh no dont hurt me grabbing all the coins i can im innocent oh  laura yeah i punched him  matt seeing this chaos  laura oh shit  matt that was a good catch meant to be all this is /none/ breaking down you can see punches going

he trips over as you yank out the  ankle from underneath him he goes spilling all the chips go scattering onto the front of the  bella union and you can see while the guards are currently inside dealing with this fight thats  broken out theres /town/ nobody outside to guard it a couple people on the street look over and is he  all right sir are you all right they start coming towards him to his aid he turns around and  looks at you and goes why would you do that  marisha well ow you stepped on my finger ow  travis i would like to rush over to him and offer him asylum in our room sir you

the hats getting all the poker chips into the various hats the  guys who were now brawling have been calmed down at this point you can see now the guards have  their pistols out one of them fires twice into the ceiling of the bella union sending dust and  little bits of plaster debris to fall all the fight ends as one of the guys is now shouting  everyone calm your shit and youre all kicked out for now while we assess what the hell /none/ just  went down you see the man who was looking over the top of the balcony now has risen up over the  edge and goes thank you my good man all of you understand we only want civilized folks here  at the bella union the man won fair and square give him his earnings and if i see any of you try  and throw a punch in here again youre banned from gambling in my establishment  marisha what is civilized  travis it means orderly the opposite of chaos  matt as you begin walking /none/ upstairs both of you carrying your hats and his nose in the air

the number to it  liam i have to come back to me reverend come back to me  matt use another red chip to add another d6  liam all right all right  matt all right so whats it now 13 ill let you do this for the sake of this so as you push  /none/ through with the doubleraise to your faith check on this you see as this bright vibrant light  suddenly fills the room from one sunbeam coming through the singular glass window striking  you in the shoulder and enveloping the entirety of reverend smith all of a sudden you in the  distance as youre inspecting the corpses you cant help but glance over your shoulder and you  watch as this ray of light envelops his body as it does he lifts gently off the table two three  inches and the doc goes what the fuck have you /dung/ brought into my place and he inspects and as you  see the reverend slowly turns over in place his eye corrects itself a smile comes across him of  serene joy and hes lowered down onto the table the light subsides you take your hand away and  he sits up in place goes my lord my mind my thoughts are mine again  liam welcome back reverend the lord will abide  matt the lord is stronger in you than anyone ive ever met  liam please dont thank me  matt he starts crying and gives you /none/ a big hug and pulls you in theres no faith stronger than what  youve brought this day  liam take him by the hands we all find ourselves low and in place of trouble its always time to  come back to his faith  matt youve lost interest in this whole circumstance about the bodies and this is for  you travis  laura what like a special note just for him  matt im not the only one that suffers so you get into this and keen as you are youve done  some hunting in your /none/ time and youve seen some wounds spent to various creatures that have been  mauled by individuals you find specifically that one it seems like a bear or at least something of  a bears size would have to have done this but its wintertime bears usually arent wandering and  the wounds here are thorough not killed something and ate pieces of it there is no indication that  there has been portions of these bodies eaten in fact they have just been killed and torn apart  laura just for no purpose  matt the doc at this /town/ point stunned by the whole miracle that just transpired before him walks  over to you and goes heres what gets me each of these bodies were found on the outskirts of  town not deep in the woods some of these folks werent seen leaving  laura like somebody wanting us to find them  matt i think some of these bodies were placed after being killed  travis how ghastly  matt i dont know if these people were outside of the town when they were killed even so im  confused just as you are about this /town/  laura so you think that whatever did this could actually be staying inside of this town  matt or at least whatever did this is working with someone within the town  marisha have you noticed any suspicious activity in the town  matt have you been to this town for long its full of suspicious activity  marisha we just arrived this morning i dont know  matt fucking damn it this whole towns full of cocksuckers and i dont know how to separate the  good from the bad i wouldnt even believe what youre saying if /none/ this guy didnt come in here and  fucking prove that god exists to me as an atheist im having a lot going in my head right now  liam hallelujah  matt hallefuckinglujah if you want to help find out what the shit did this i need a drink  and he goes over and grabs the bottle of laudanum next to the guy

normally no one could keep you from a sip of laudanum but watching the miracles that  transpire around this bright and /tavern/ bushyfaced gentleman you think maybe you should drink this  when hes not around and you gently give it back to the doctor  laura fine i wasted a chip to talk him into giving it to me in the first place  liam listen im going to give this to you its a bar of soap its my last one use it  matt i appreciate you all having your conversations but if you could do it outside i  got business to tend to  laura oh that tastes like shit what is this  liam it doesnt /none/ go in your mouth you know what soap is right  travis yeah its made of lye its for cleaning yourself with  matt as he starts pushing you guys outside of the place and you get outside before he closes the  door he goes just a word i dont know if this will help much but each of those that were killed  inside here were plot owners in gold and silver veins  travis you dont say  matt except for the last two  laura what were they  matt hugh and kilmer the ones you /town/ were looking at they were under the employ of al swearengen in  the gem saloon now get out and he slams the door behind you  liam the video

gotta be strong when youre raising such a creature now  travis all right  laura so make sure you discipline him but also give him lots of love and whisky but no  chocolate i hear thats bad for him  travis whisky love whisky and chocolate  laura no chocolate  matt the bear which is nuzzling under your hand stinky jules and is /none/ like just licking  laura what can i say he just loves the way i

close  travis no no did you give it a name  laura trinket  travis trinket oh yes like a little cork hello trinket it is your uncle sydney  matt bites at your hand what is /none/ your parry  travis my

the gem saloon its not too far from the bella union  travis this way mind the horseshit  laura i step right through the horseshit  matt she does right up to the ankle  travis to each their own  matt you eventually make your way towards the gem saloon as you /none/ walk up there is piano being  played but unlike the bella union its not quite as fanciful and the interiors a little more  dreary as you step inside you can see a few patrons around you can see a few of the female  workers of the establishment who are all leaning in the back corner in various states of undress  but all look hot and not really into it at the moment  travis reverend avert your eyes hello  matt as you walk in and say that you see across the way a man with /none/ a big black beard and long  hair little bowler cap on with a rifle across his shoulder and a white shirt with a single strap  over for his overalls looks over and starts walking towards you with his rifle in his hand  just goes clarota voice what brings

dark forest the evening air has definitely consumed this area  you can hear the crickets in the distance chirping and the occasional distant hooting of a  night owl owl hooting  /none/ marisha what does the moon look like  matt you look up and the moon is a bright vibrant circular white it looks to be  marisha so its a full moon  matt close to full or full and that light is aiding you to get through some part of the forest  as scattered as it is amongst the trees  marisha would i have any occult knowledge about  matt make an occult check knowledgeoccult  marisha the moon and maybe things come out at the moon times  liam accented that is a moon  marisha /none/ accented that is a moon in the skies  dice hitting the floor  marisha oh noes  liam fail  marisha oh it was a four can i keep

furry beasts with the nasty teeth various forms of lycanthropy  are affected at this point in time based on the information /none/ that these attacks happened every few  weeks and the cycle of the lunar cycle you gather theres probably a very good chance that  this beast thats been seen multiple times is some sort of a shapeshifter  marisha the full moon it has mystical powers id watch out for any type of lycanthropy in the area  laura what the fuck is lycanthropy  marisha you goods youve had those hiccups for  liam spits ugh  laura what did you eat son  liam i dont know what happened last night  marisha you shouldnt eat from /town/ the traveling street carts those are bad  liam i have a lot of praying to do  travis would you pray for me as well it burns when i pee i think it might have

marisha i would like a d6  matt like a d6  marisha ooh thats good ten  matt ten you do also recall as youre putting these beats of information together full moon  lycanthropy seemingly rumours spreading wide youve heard of silver mines drying up or being  purchased up  marisha you know there are /none/ certain things that really like silver when theyre also lycanthropes  laura what the fuck is that word youre saying  travis like or dont like  marisha like  laura like  marisha i dont know do i know things that might like silver  matt people like silver  marisha i know certain things are afraid of silver  matt werewolves  marisha they hate silver  matt for werewolves lycanthropes its the only thing that can kill them  travis thank you  marisha my immediate thought would be if i was werewolf  laura theres a /none/ wait what are we talking about werewolves i thought it was a bear  marisha thats what lycanthropes are werewolves  laura oh i understand  liam is that a thing that we would all know about in this  matt folklore has heard stories and such youve never encountered one its occasionally maybe  heard of in fairy tales and such times have been weird as of late  marisha if i was werewolf and had vulnerability to silver id want to control all the silver so  laura oh  marisha that way no one can hurt me /none/  laura so we got a big old wolf trying to quarantine off  marisha or a bear or it could be other beasts  travis wait wait wait didnt swearengen say that cy had bought all of the gold and silver  mines you dont think that cy could be  matt he didnt say that cy did he said that theyd been purchased up cy had lost a lot of  money hes worried that hurst might be buying them up  travis oh yes george hurst actually  marisha i also saw cy run very quickly right /town/ before the moon came out  travis troubling  marisha just saying  travis troubling troubling thoughts  marisha i think we should keep an eye on simon  laura should we keep looking for a wolf then or should we talk to these people in town that  you think might be a wolf  travis i think george hursts establishment would be a good place to visit  liam is our trail cold here  matt you guys are deep in the forest where are you going are you heading towards  marisha if its full moon then /none/ hes out in beast form we have good chance of finding him in beast form  matt who wants to make a tracking check  laura ill try  travis i would love to  laura but i dont got a thing  travis is it tracking yeah its tracking  liam can we all make a tracking check  matt you can all make a tracking check all unskilled im pretty sure  liam and then do we roll if youve got no skill in it is it two d4s  matt no its a d4 and a d6 /none/ and then minus two  laura oh i did it wrong  marisha so do you add the d4 and the d6 together  matt no you take the higher of the two  laura and if you get the top you get to roll again  matt yeah  liam two  marisha three  travis six four  laura 16  matt minus two 14  laura 14  travis that was a good stack  laura that was  matt so as you all are lost entirely in the middle of this forest middle of the night /none/ the  moonlight the only thing thats giving you any sort of visual reference all of a sudden you  stinky ja stinky jules  laughter  laura i wondered what you were going to call me there  matt stinky jules you look over and you see particularly little spats of blood and larger  beast tracks recent ones that scale up this way you begin to follow and you guys follow behind  stinky jules you come over a ridge looking down to where a lot of the plots a lot of the set  claims are all /none/ set up the side and separated with flags and various markers and such you can see a  number of them have been closed and boarded up  marisha the mines  travis what do you see  laura uh a bunch of things have been boarded up can we take them down and go in the place  matt if you want to theres a number of ones you can go and check out  travis not in the terribly condemned  hauntedlooking  laura why dont you lead the way there syd  travis highpitched me  laura /dung/ yeah you look like youre capable  travis look ive already got quite a bit of blood on my sleeve i was not quite prepared for this  maybe i could draw the outside of this establishment ill go all right fine  laura yeah all right  travis and ill go up to the entrance of the mine  matt its a campsite that is currently abandoned and it looks like its been abandoned for a while  there are a number of wooden boards that are placed up against the entrance you look around  and you can /dung/ see a bunch of leftover discarded mining materials and what looks like most of the remnants  or the scraps that are left behind in one of the big mining carts thats currently outside make a  notice check thisd be investigation make an investigation  travis investigation okay  ooh four  laura ooh  travis ooh five ill take the five  matt you glance around and look inside this and look around the exterior of it the dust around  here is silver specifically in nature this is a silver mine  travis my fellows this appears /dung/ to be a silver mine crazy  marisha mmhmm  laura right should we look inside the mine  liam yeah whatever this thing is a scourge  laura do we see tracks of a beast around  matt the beast tracks faded once it got over the ridge and went down to the claim area so  laura what about this little bear cub that we got with us does he smell anything around  matt laughs ill roll for the bear cub bear cub kind of sniffing cute growl kind of  leans up against you  laura /dung/ tell you what hes useless but he sure is damn cute  travis yes he is  marisha i still say we use him as bait  liam also i dont understand are we saying that silver is a danger to these creatures is that  what youre implying why would he have run into the middle of a silver mine  marisha probably wouldnt have  travis unless he was wounded by the gun that poor late charlie was holding  liam it doesnt make sense if silver is a bane to these creatures it wouldnt have run right /dung/ into  the heart of it  travis it must be empty then stinky jane um jules why dont you take a look inside  laura all right i go and look inside the mine  matt okay so you pry open some of the board  laura yeah pull back some of that wood  matt the air is dry and musty in there you get a few feet in and its pitch black theres no light  laura do we got any sort of ive got some matches  travis i do too  marisha ive got a /dung/ lantern  laura oh hey whos got a lantern  marisha i come in with a lantern  travis lead the way im sure its totally empty im right behind you  liam im going to walk behind  marisha come on jules  laura all right  marisha the ladies are leading the way what do we see  matt you guys glance inside you walk about 20 30 feet into the mine before it opens into two  different paths but immediate at a glance as  laura im holding my hand above my pistol  matt okay /dung/ you look down both sides of the split y formation deep into this mine and you can see  areas that have been heavily mined but the thing that catches your attention is for being boarded  up and abandoned theres still a lot of apparent silver veins in the walls that are in the middle  of being mined before they were left behind you see visible veins even this quickly in  laura looks like somebodys trying to  liam hiccups and spits  laura watch them feathers somebodys trying to keep people from getting this silver  /dung/ liam chat loves a serial killer  laura what  travis i take offence to that good sir  marisha so they bought the mine simply to  laura and marisha shut it down  marisha da  laura we should get some of that silver though  donation prompt all right  marisha all right  travis should we explore perhaps see if anything was left behind  laura well i see some silvers left behind and i try to get some  marisha we should probably get silver yeah can we get some silver pieces  matt yeah /none/ and actually it takes you about half an hour or so but you manage to scrounge up some  decent chunks of silver probably about five pounds worth which is quite a bit  laura i dont want to cart around that much im going to take about a pound of it stick it in my shirt  marisha ill take the other four pounds  laura all right  matt laughs all right  laura whats wrong with your damn wrist  travis it it does pulse quite a bit  donation prompt all right  laura all right /none/ give it to me ill take a look at it again  travis im quite thirsty too i have a bit of cottonmouth going on  laura ill just keep on pushing  travis pained motherfuck i would appreciate it if you didnt quite press on it quite that hard  laura somethings weird with this guy  liam is there any hair coming out of that hand  matt nope not that you can see make a notice check  liam okay uh no idea what that is what do i roll  marisha 1d4  laura and then /none/ minus two  matt youre not

and im going to waste a blue so thats a three plus two  is five  matt okay  liam ill settle at five  travis toss that blue send it flying  matt best you can tell based on the wound its a mild wound its a little /none/ swollen it seems to  be fine but no other visual effect than that  travis pants its so hot in here isnt it i do feel perhaps its the lantern pants and ill  actually take off the outer coat and really just roll up the shirt  matt big pit stains  liam are you sure you dont want a poultice on that  laura do you want to hold some of that silver  liam its really a simple thing for me to do to wrap some mud and some water  travis i feel like im /dung/ earning my marks im quite proud  matt you hear from the far far depths of the mine  donation prompt all right  matt a faint sound going not all right  laughter  matt it goes creepy exhale  laura oh shit  matt a deep echoing exhale from deeper in the mine  travis oh no um i dont suppose any of you had gas just then  laura well i did but its usually silent  matt creepy exhale its still a ways away but its getting slowly louder  laura what the fuck is that /none/  travis uh hello  marisha we should go deeper  laura i bet that things in here  travis what thing no  liam well we have to make a choice we either go in now stop it from escaping if its our killer  or go back for reinforcements  laura lets go kill it  travis yes but could we take a moment to consider that it was boarded up  laura i want to go kill it  liam i take out my crucifix and lead the way  laura yeah lets go  marisha before /none/ we walk off i go sydney catch and i toss him a piece of silver  matt okay  travis oh thank you what is this for  marisha just  travis last night yes jolly good  marisha i thought itd be good if we all had some  matt all right you guys begin to curl around the left side where the sounds coming from and as  you come into a larger mining chamber  laura im holding up silver and i got my hand on my pistol  matt you see  marisha ive got the /none/ lantern  matt not a furry creature as your lantern passes by all of a sudden it catches a darker shadowed  shape that looks like a human but with a larger head than normal its body is black and bulbous  and it looks almost shiny like its covered in oil but thats its natural form it glances over  real fast and its eyes glow as it flashes in the light and hisses it scatters out of the light  laura ugh i shoot it  matt into a far corner youre going to shoot it  laura /none/ yeah  matt all right go ahead and make your shooting skill check  liam are her bullets still smited  matt no the smite only lasts for a few rounds  liam god damn it  matt yeah  liam i mean god bless it  laughter  laura what do i roll for this  liam youre asking me  laura whats rof is that what i roll a six do i roll a d6  matt you do  laura okay  liam 2d oh thats the damage  laura im going to reroll  matt d6 /none/ on your shooting your shooting is a d10 i think  laura oh shit

wanted to reroll the trait die  matt okay got you and the six was a four  laura yes  matt okay so the bear thinking that youre its mother and sees suddenly the fear runs to your  side and clings to you and in doing so disables your shot and you have to go with the lower  strike on that one  laura damn it  matt but you do get a black chip from that one  laura well thats good hand it over  /dung/ matt and the bear is heavily blue chip to you liam  liam oh my god that was your boob  marisha im great it was my knee my knee deflected  matt the bear is shaking against you and making it harder to shoot the gun ricochets off the far  back wall sparking across the stone  laura im pushing the bear off my leg  matt and you hear once again creepy breathing  travis i said thats supposed to be mine  matt heavy breathing ill have you guys go ahead and each draw a card /none/ at random from your deck  laura oh jeez okay  liam shuffle one more time  laura youre going to shuffle it  liam hey question way earlier in the game as i shuffle my cards you said that i gained two  miracle points back its been a while do i or do i not  matt you gain one more back so youve gained three total of what youve used  liam so say that last bit again because i thought i was down to one so if youre giving me  one now i have two /none/  travis ladies first pick a card  matt youve cast three miracles correct  liam oh jesus i dont know i was marking it down and before i asked you that question i was  at one point  matt how did you get one point how much do your miracles cost  liam i did a lot of shit man i thought it was two a miracle  matt it should say on them then yeah  liam i healed a couple of people i smited her bullets  matt right so that would be  liam three /none/  matt three uses four uses but youve regained three so you would have been at two to five  liam so im at five now  matt youre at five now  liam okay  laura wow did you pull a card  liam i did not im going to pull this one  laura oh jesus really  marisha son of a bitch  laura do you see what just happened with the three of these  matt wow thats great great and what do you have laura a jack okay first things first as  you were /none/ not quite fast enough  marisha can we use fate chips to redraw cards  matt nope chuckles  marisha fucking fuck  matt this strange creature whos keeping in the shadows just outside your lanternlight you hear  the rasping growl and it lunges out at you being the closest to it it swoops out towards you you  can see its bulbous its only about three feet tall in its size but its larger head is  awfullooking and its just a terriblelooking thing large saucers for its face it strikes out  towards you with two of /dung/ its claws i want you all to go ahead and roll a guts roll by the way  laura guts roll oh jeez  matt minus one  laura man come on im rerolling just in case oh sorry i should warn you  matt im going to reroll that  marisha no im going to spend a fate chip to counter

marisha running out of fate chips  matt all right so what do you got  marisha three on my guts  liam nine  travis five  laura eight  matt all right you everyone else has managed to take this back you are finding yourself shaken  from the perspective of this and youre now holding the lantern theres not much else you can  do at this moment when it comes to your turn youll have to see if you can reveal that  however it does swipe out /none/ at you thats going to be so what is your parry  laura five  matt it rolled a six it hits you it strikes out you go ahead and suffer from that thats  going to be im going to go ahead and add a d6 to that  marisha what did you use  matt it was black all right that would be eight points of damage whats your toughness  laura five  matt five you are shaken right now as it strikes out at you and strikes its claw across your  front you manage to /none/ pull it off and it just barely cuts the skin but its enough to freak you  out at the moment that ends its turn and then youre up next actually at the top of your turn  go ahead and make a spirit check to try and regain your composure  donation prompt all right  laura all right i will ooh yes nine  matt nine all right black chip here you shake it off youre no longer shaken but thats all  you can really do this turn as you go ahead and try and steady yourself /none/ and start going for your  gun now to pull it out ill say you can pull your gun out for this turn as well all right the rest  of you guys now you go ahead and see if you can make a spirit check to not be shaken  marisha just roll a d6 2d6  matt it would be 2d6 for anything you roll as a trained check so yeah  marisha ooh six seven total  matt so youre no longer shaken thats the end of your turn you guys what do you want to do /none/  travis go ahead father  liam i want to stab this thing with my crucifix  matt go for it so go ahead and roll fighting  liam okay so oh i do have skill in that so its a d4 and a d6 okay four

matt as you slam /none/ it with the crucifix shrieks it shrieks back in this highpitched wail and begins to  push back into the shadows away from you but not far enough away to go ahead and give you a  secondary melee attack against it so its right in your face out of the line of the lantern all  right that brings it to you travis  travis i kneel down and i say oh look a weapon and i pull out of my boot a bowie knife  and i would like to rush the creature  matt go for it /none/  liam i really admire you  travis oh shit what do i roll  matt this would be fighting  liam sydney voice there seems to

that was worse  matt which of the two  travis the six  matt six six does hit go ahead and roll your /none/ damage so 2d4 plus two  travis one three five a total of five  matt toughness of six you go ahead and strike with the dagger and as you hit its hide it scrapes  in but does not appear to leave a wound its somewhat crackled black shadowy form absorbing  most of the impact of the blow and it turns and hisses at you its horrible small babylike  mouth filled with layers of sharp teeth all right your turn back were back at the top of  the round it goes back its now going to /none/ lash out at you sydney its going to go ahead and  make its strike at you im going to go ahead and add six to that that is thats going to be a  ten whats your parry  travis six  matt six okay so it does hit you it is not a raise so it doesnt get the additional d6 damage  i will spend another blue chip to go ahead and add a d6 to the damage its already doing  marisha blue chips i dont have any blue chips to counter  matt all right /none/ thats going to be 11 whats your toughness  travis five  matt five that is six points of damage to you so that is considered a raise so you actually are  shaken and you take a wound you are actually wounded the creature leaps out and jams its claws  into your side and bites into your throat you freak out and push it back it doesnt manage to  pull anything free but it does leave these giant bite marks on the side  travis im leaking yelps please help me  matt all right youre up /none/ stinky jules  laura all right i want to shoot it a whole bunch of times im going to fan my hammer  matt okay all right so your guns already out youre going to go ahead and take all six rounds  on it at minus two  laura yeah lets do it i have no idea how that  matt make your shooting roll six times minus two for each roll  laura okay so thats just a six  matt whatever your shooting is shooting is a d10 youre really good at shooting  marisha hey thats /none/ good same

each of them  laura oh my gosh so did i hit every single time  matt every single one hit so roll 2d6 for the first shot  liam jeepers  laura six plus one is seven for the first  matt all right so it is all right next one  laura seven for the second  matt all right next one  laura ooh gasps /none/ 19 oh my gosh 24 on the next  matt so before you get to the rest of the shots you just screaming echoing you unload as this  creature turns around and its face gets shredded by a hail of bullets from your gun as it slumps  to the ground and turns to ash and shadow before dissipating with a sizzling sound youre still  liam ease down ease down its dead  laura what the fuck was that thing whats up lucas  matt we have ten minutes left on this game to go ahead and get /dung/ to 70000 guys  laura how close are we  matt how close are we  offscreen were at about 68000  travis 68000 just 2000 away  matt all right so  laura i used so many of my chips on that one  offscreen were only at 67000  laura oh 67000  matt so after the creatures down you spend a while searching the mine nothing else of this  type seems to be down here as you make your way outside of the mine you glance and see what looks  to be in the distance /none/ about four individuals running away who seem to have been tracking you  you see them run towards a distant place into the shadows  marisha how far away are they  matt about at this point 200 feet or so  marisha still far enough away to where i can shout at them  matt its up to you  marisha sudis will shout if you run only death will come and find you and im going to attempt  to try and shaken them  matt okay go ahead and make a persuasion roll  laura im going /none/ to reload my gun while were leaving the place  liam im going to bless her bullets  marisha ooh i rolled an eight with a five so thats 13 plus two 15  matt all righty you watch as most of them run away and one gentleman stops and turns around  death i dont want death to follow me at which point suddenly you watch as a large cougar leaps  out and just tears his throat out and starts chewing into his corpse  liam how did you do that  marisha i told you i told /none/ you  laura a large cougar  travis thats a big fucking cat  laura should we shoot it  matt its large for a cougar but its not quite what you were looking for  laura okay all right  travis i mean there are three of

walking out with  his hat he goes theyre right there and he turns away to /none/ the side and you see stepping out  as well the gentleman simon you met earlier and a few other individuals you see holding a couple  of guns trained on you standing in the center cy tolliver you see him step out his outfit is  shredded hes like if you guys had all just decided to not go poking where it didnt belong  liam we can handle this peacefully stinky put your gun down and i bless her bullets  matt all right go ahead and make a faith check  we just hit 70000 guys  /none/ cheering  laura good job

weapons and no silver bullets the fight presses on for a few more minutes as you all do  the best you can to combat this overwhelming source but the perpetual spray of bullets in your  direction eventually puts most of you onto the /none/ ground and as the wolf tears into your face  stinky jules you scream out as the jaws of cy tolliver now extended into white and bloodied  fangs rips the face from your body taking out your jugular you freak out eb farnum manages  to get a crack shot that takes off the top half of your head you  liam thank you lord for letting me sleep with two women and a man  laughter  matt you hear a familiar voice in the back of your head go yes you followed the right path  and /none/ you feel this crackling of flames over your shoulders before as now you realize that this  voice indeed was not leading you down the right way  liam no shit  laura what about trinket is he alive  matt trinkets over your body now as the werewolf has let it alone  laura humping  matt and is just humping your knee as you bleed out its horrible time limits  liam wait flames on my back what  matt you feel flames on your back knowing that this entity thats been whispering into your  head is /none/ not from your deity however the werewolf walks over grabs you by the arm and lifts you  back onto your feet turns back toward you the preacher and goes do what youre meant to do  cy commands it you watch as the visage of the fantastic sydney dissipates and in his place now  standing before you instead is a humanoid catlike tiger creature with two backwards hands  laughter  liam thanks chat  marisha thanks chat thank you for that  travis oh i hated that fucking accent anyway i want to see what you look /none/ like on the inside and  i shove a blade right under his belly button and open him up from bottom to top  matt you pray as hard as you can to your deity but the pain is too hard but you cant help but  scream out in horrible agony as you are gutted
