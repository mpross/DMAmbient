none	 welcome back that was pretty creative well done  liam he would totally do that  matt hmm thats a 6thlevel spell anyway welcome back to catch up on what previously  occurred the mighty nein had decided to leave zadash in the wake of the now declared war between  the dwendalian empire and the xhorhasian hordes to the east you decided to side with the gentleman  a purveyor of various darker and underhanded deeds throughout this side of the empire who offered you  two possible contracted options you chose both and proceeded onto your first leg 
dung	 of this journey  to the northeast to the labenda swamp and to the city of berleben where you were tasked to discover  what had happened to a safe house of which various smuggled goods would be stored and then  transported through that had gone dark for a number of weeks you packed up made your way in  that direction traversed through the outskirts of the swamp managed to save a tiny bird friend from  being consumed by a few large crocodiles and scoured the swamp city of berleben in search of  some means of 
tavern	 information to find the individual that the gentleman says would be able to help you  in this journey febron febron was found drunk and disorderly in the keystone pub  laura thats so sexy  matt oh so sexy hes a right nice one but no you managed to interrogate him made him an offer  he couldnt refuse and he agreed to lead you onto where the safe house exists within the swamp you  rented out the rooms in the subterranean chambers of the old and almost collapsed pub you separated  yourselves for the evening completed 
none	 your rest and we pick up as morning comes to greet you  lightless as there are no windows and you just eventually come to on what you assume is an  evenings full rest you all independently come to shake your heads and get yourselves prepared for  what the next days journey arises you gather your things and you glare at the rather awkward  febron across the way who as you wake up is just sitting there watching you sleep  marisha and laura ew  ashley youre so creepy im going to pull the bed out 
none	 from the door are you ready to get up  matt well i mean im ready to do whatever you want lead the way  ashley great retches okay open the door well head upstairs  matt you guys begin to  laura we wake up all cuddled in a pile in our room  marisha yeah just floofy with kiri in between  matt chirping  laura a little cuddle pile  matt like jester its sharp  laura you dont sleep with the daggers kiri you want to remove them  matt chirping  laura we should have 
none	 taught her that last night  marisha yeah thats pretty im glad were alive  matt you guys all begin to gather and make your way up the ladder through the hatch in the floor  of the keystone pub which is not bustling by any means there are maybe three patrons in the  process of having their morning ale you glance over the side and you can see dent bonswallow  whos in the process of cleaning off a number of the glasses from the night before he looks over  in your direction and goes oh right 
none	 bright morning to you all rise up would you like  breakfast of some kind hey  travis thats a lot of fucking energy this early in the morning god clears throat  laura i would like so much of whatever you have please thank you  matt right coming right up go an find a place to sit be with you in about an hour  all an hour  matt well ive got to make your food  grumbling  travis do you have to go and kill it first  matt hes counting about an hour  
town	 laura ugh thats a long time  travis yeah what are we going to do until then  sam its like an easybake oven  travis i mean should we explore the street that were on i mean weve got a long wait time  sam should we see if the oh no the horses were taken  travis they took the cart  laura to the stables  matt yeah thats all situated there there is in the far corner of the chamber the back wall  opposite to the right of where the stage is being constructed though 
none	 right now it looks like  theres no current construction going on at the moment a hooded figure is slowly walking towards  the table where you guys are deciding or not whether to sit  laura we run for it and we get the table first  matt okay you manage to sit on one of the small benches on the side scrapes the ground as you  push into the side and the  marisha i take my staff and i lay it long ways over the entire bench on the other side  travis the old movie 
dung	 theater grab  marisha yeah  matt the cloaked figure stops and takes in this physical display and then continues to approach  liam frumpkin walks to the edge of the table and shows his butthole by lifting his tail up  matt mark if you want to step in  laughter  marisha were always so mean to the guests  matt mark hulmes longtime friend dungeon master of high rollers  liam i just cant believe he got here  mark you tried  matt the first thing you see the individuals you have been waiting throughout the 
dung	 evening to show  up begin to step through groggily complain about the space and then claim a table as you begin to  approach which you are greeted with stares and a cat butthole  laura this table is taken by the mighty nein but if you need anything theres other tables  mark oh yeah hi actually i kind of you see this femininelooking figure long black hair that  covers almost the entire side of her left face wearing a hood up dark green cloak black and  green clothes you can occasionally see green ribbons in 
none	 her long hair she is like im really  sorry to bother you guys just i couldnt help but overhear some conversation you had last im  sorry to be really forward are you heading into the swamp today  marisha you were listening in to our conversations  mark not on purpose im really desperate to find a way into the swamp and you were talking really loudly  laura i like your ribbons  mark thank you oh my youre blue and she gasps and she looks up at you  laura youre not  mark no i 
none	 mean youre so cute and looks around  travis if you dont mind us asking why are you heading into the swamp yourself  mark oh well its kind of a long story just  liam oh well we have an hour  mark its also a bit of well i mean you guys havent been hired by any creepy people in dragon  masks have you you dont know anyone like that  marisha i mean not for several years for a different reason  taliesin definitely a long time since ive dealt with anyone in a dragon mask 
none	  laura ive never seen anyone in a dragon mask before  sam weve been hired by creepy people but not by oh so im wearing a mask but that is a  different kind of mask its not a dragon mask  marisha same kind of creepy though  laura and this is a bird  matt chirping  mark what is that  laura and taliesin a bird  mark like it walks around  matt like jester a bird  laura she she walks around  matt like jester she walks around  travis repeats stuff yeah 
none	  mark oh my god  laura shes kind of the best  mark shes adorable hello  matt like cali hello  sam shes doing you  matt whistles  mark stuttering oh my god  liam edubation  matt she pulls a dagger out  laura no probably not so much like that  mark wow ive never seen a bird like that before that can talk is that your daughter  travis yes yep mmhmm  sam yes hes my dad  mark i can tell by the ears  laura and the green  mark yeah 
none	 thats what i thought green ears and then like the anyway sorry im getting  distracted from what you asked me that happens sometimes just give me a nudge and ill get back  on track theres something out in the swamp theres somewhere like a smugglers holdout or  like a storehouse i think maybe  laura mm weird thats crazy  taliesin thats a weird thing to put in the middle of a swamp  laura yeah well anyway what it is that you need with that though  mark well somebody was transporting an item im looking 
none	 for and i think its there and i need to get  it before some other people get it but im not stealing it well i kind of am stealing it but  im taking it back for a good reason  laura is it the people in the dragon masks that want it  mark yeah it is you look trustworthy  travis are you getting paid for this item retrieval  mark me  travis yeah  mark no its more of a personal thing i want to make sure it doesnt get into the wrong hands  
none	 laura is it your underwear  mark what  sam yeah whats the item i mean im sure my father would want to know whats the item  matt like jester your underwear  mark well its a bowl i know that sounds weird i think its part of a ritual and i need to get it  sam like a bowl or a bowl  mark ive never seen a bowl like that you couldnt get a lot of soup in a bowl like that  big i mean a big bowl  laura its a soup bowl then 
none	  travis what have you been doing after school honey  sam afterschool activities  mark you have a very comfortable relationship its really nice to see to be honest  travis very open yeah were like best friends  sam i tell him everything  mark thats good you need to have that trust between family  liam you want to have a big bowl  travis so youre searching for a bowl  mark yeah thats right  travis and used in rituals  mark i think so yes i need to make sure it doesnt fall into 
none	 the wrong hands thats all  travis our business might be headed out that way a little later today does she have any weapons on  her that are visible  matt make a perception check  travis not me  marisha youre not grog anymore its okay  travis yes thats okay 17  matt all right glancing about  mark theres no obvious weapons that you can see on her but she has this long green cloak thats  really covering her left side and you would probably see that theres black scales all over  her left 
none	 side and shes deliberately holding her arm completely hidden her arms invisible  underneath the cloak  liam also im wondering if she seems straightforward is the nervousness an act  matt make an insight check  liam yeah okay  matt welcome to playing with caleb  laura insight check insight check  mark i know ive seen this show  liam its a 15  matt 15 okay it seems to be rather forthright yeah seems to be on the level  liam okay  sam which is not a good answer  matt yeah she seems nervous 
none	  liam could go either way on that  matt you know based on what youre asking as far as the features if i recall theyre was it  halfelven  mark yeah the human half looks halfelven ever so slightly elven features slightly pointed ear  but the left side covered  marisha all right so youre looking for a bowl a dangerous bowl  laura a soup bowl used in rituals  mark yeah  marisha you dont want to get it in the wrong hands because  taliesin of people in dragon masks  travis do you 
none	 think theyre sending people to get it there before you  mark i love your jewelry by the way its really nice  taliesin thank you ive picked everything out myself this is all put together  laura tinkling  liam also why do these people want the bowl that youre talking about  mark theyre do any of them have holy symbols or religious symbols anywhere on their person  taliesin im literally covered in them  mark of who  taliesin everybody literally the coat is made up of seven different options  matt everybody who is legal 
none	 within the empire  taliesin yes but theres also yeah  mark is the platinum dragon one of those  taliesin yeah im wearing a platinum dragon necklace  mark okay she notices the platinum dragon are you a worshipper of the platinum dragon by any chance  taliesin sure  mark okay yeah well if youre traveling with somebody whos a worshipper of the platinum  dragon i guess i can trust you  travis oh good for us  laura hes incredibly trustworthy and he worships like crazy  taliesin thats what everybody says  mark oh by 
none	 the gods thats  taliesin remind me to show you my tapestries  mark okay  travis is that code for something  taliesin no its literally my tapestries  marisha just dont touch them  laura because hes had them wrapped around his weenie  mark like oh my good uh well um  taliesin shes high on sugar dont listen to her anyway  mark yeah have you ever heard of the scaled tyrant  travis and sam no  mark well its probably a good thing theyre not a very nice goddess and the worshippers of her 
none	  are after this bowl and i need to stop them getting it theyre not good people  travis and you have a reason to believe that they are expeditiously heading towards this bowl as well  mark they bought it and i think theyre after it now yes  liam this is a very tactless question but you are talking about the scaled tyrant and you also  are sporting some scales is that a coincidence or are they related  mark im sorry a lot of people get really nervous when they see them im not diseased or 
none	  cursed or anything just yeah ive  liam were pretty cool  mark she brushes the hair to her side and she adjusts the cloak and you can see the whole left  side is black dragon scales and her hand is a draconic claw  laura and ashley whoa  mark a black dragon tail sweeps out from under the cloak im like a tenth dragon and some people  get freaked out by that  marisha youre sure youre just a tenth  mark yeah i think so all i know is that a great ancestor of 
dung	 mine was a black dragon and ive  inherited some of that  laura like a full dragon  mark yeah thats what ive been told  matt i think its pretty sexy to be honest you see febron there is this creepier old man  balding little liver spotted missing most of his teeth one eye wandering a bit  mark is he with you  marisha no  laura well hes going to take us where we need to go  mark oh so  liam hes work for hire  mark okay all right im just going 
none	 to stand next to caleb away from this guy  marisha ive had shorter conversations with family members whats your name  mark oh sorry im calianna you can call me cali  marisha kelly  mark cali  marisha cali calianna thats cool  mark hi nice to meet you all what are your names  matt like nott welcome to the mighty nein the little bird creature begins to chirp in your  direction  mark thats a really long name  laura shes kiri  mark oh kiri hello kiri i am cali  matt like cali 
none	 hello kiri im cali  mark no youre kiri  matt like cali youre kiri  mark no im cali  matt chirping  sam only 56 more minutes until breakfast is ready  matt for the sake of expediency you share what information you choose to in that space of time  but food does come to you piecemeal as your fine dent bonswallow friend decides to deliver it plate by  plate as it arrives its passable most of its a little overcooked breakfast meats bit of rubbery  egg and thats about it a good swamp breakfast 
none	  laura they need more sugar here  travis listen we are kind of heading in that direction  mark i wont be a burden or anything but if you dont mind me coming i could use the help the  swamp ive tried to go out in it by myself and theres something out there  laura gators giant ones  mark ive seen some of those i avoided them but theres also something else i havent quite  seen it yet  matt growling you hear this deep horrible growling sound that echoes around you  mark thats 
none	 it i heard that noise  matt you see kiris feathers fluffing up as she does it growling  sam can you do that again kiri  matt growling  sam have we ever heard this sound before  matt its the sound of the crocodiles from the battle before  liam frumpkin travels over to kiri and starts going purring as he nestles against kiri  matt kiri starts fluffing and loosely purring back  mark is that cat with you  liam the cat is with me  mark oh cats dont like me they tend to really 
none	 freak out  travis yes i understand that completely you and i were going to be real close i can feel  mark i think they can smell the dragon blood  travis i know they can tell  mark are you a dragon as well  travis no im allergic  liam i take a step and a half away from cali  laura cali did you hear any howling in the swamp because we heard there were howling  monsters  matt nothing that was howlingesque necessarily but you didnt travel too far into  the swamp  
none	 mark no i didnt really go that far deep in with the gators and some shadows moving around i  know a little magic but ive never fought before so  sam youve never fought  mark no i had a bit of a reclused upbringing i learned magic i know a few spells and i learned  how to control it a bit draconic blood gives me some magic but ive never been in a real fight  before  sam caleb can teach you all about magic he knows all the spells and hes very wise  mark 
none	 really  sam yes  mark oh wow  travis although i dont think were going to have time for that if youre going to join us youre  going to have to work for your food you understand  mark i do  travis my names fjord by the way  mark nice to meet you fjord  marisha beau  mark beau  liam caleb yeah  sam bren  mark bren  laura jester fancypants  mark thats a brilliant name  taliesin molly  ashley yasha  mark i havent spoken to you youre very big 
none	  ashley yeah i mean thats just me  mark i like your black and white hair thats cool  ashley thanks  marisha youre very excitable  matt like jester this is kiri  mark cali  ashley so can you shoot out fire out your nose and all that  mark well kind of  laura just the one one nostril  mark i could try yeah its mainly if i breathe its more acid but i can control some fire as well  marisha do you have one little wing back there too  mark no wings 
tavern	 just the tail and the claw  marisha that would have been cool though  mark the claws kind of sharp i learned to fight with it a little bit  ashley can i see it  mark yeah im just is there anybody else around in the tavern  matt theres at this point two other patrons but theyre not really paying attention  mark ill put my back to them and then ill move up to yasha she takes her cloak off and brings  out this scaled  matt jesus christ thats your arm  mark is 
none	 that the  matt yeah thats febron  mark yeah it is  matt dont get me wrong i still think its pretty foxy  taliesin thats somehow even creepier  laura you know what i appreciate that youre so accepting of everything febron  mark it is quite nice  matt been around as long as i have you live a life of beggars cant be choosers  taliesin and right back in the pit anyway  mark but yeah im happy to help and work and do what you need me to do i just really need to 
none	  get this item i need to make sure it  travis i understand unfortunately my daughter is very particular about shiny and expensive  things so if this bowl has any worth im afraid we might need to be compensated for our troubles  did you happen to bring any coin with you  mark only a little i could maybe trade you something for it but id like to keep it on me  for now if you dont mind its a small trinket its got a little bit of magic but its just  that you can 
none	 see on her human arm its a silver bracelet with a charm token hanging off it with a  green emerald  sam i love trinkets  mark its an arcane focus im told but it has a little magic to it  laura trinkets are pretty great  sam they are they always have been  travis we normally have a no stranger policy but well keep a close eye on you if you get up to  any tricksy business  mark i promise no tricksy business from me  travis i hear you talking still yeah yasha 
none	 and molly theyll remove your head for you you  understand  taliesin very gently and politely but yeah  ashley you know what i really like your scales i would probably fashion a cool cover for my arm  laura yasha  ashley im not going to do it im just saying its really cool full transparency  mark ill be good i promise  marisha were not responsible for any injury or death that you may sustain while traveling with  us even if it is from a member of the mighty nein  travis should we have 
none	 her sign something i mean should we have a release form  laura ill write up a release form really fast  sam oh illustrated  laura yes  sam illustrate all the things that could happen  laura arms being chopped off an axe to the face i will illustrate being burned by fire  sam castration  laura pulled apart by gators probably something creepy and howling eating you as well  liam this is probably stating the obvious but if you have not picked up on it yourself we are kind  of a pack of assholes 
none	  laura im going to use the colored ink from my mom to make it really gory  mark youre not trying to burn me youre not threatening to kill me because im cursed yeah  you all seem lovely really youre much better than most people i have to deal with to be  honest  laura here you go you can sign this  mark okay sorry  laughter  laura all right we have a deal  travis good youre in  laura welcome to the mighty nein  matt like jester welcome to the mighty nein 
none	  mark this bird is adorable  marisha oh shit theres not no were not ironic any more  travis well well see how we are at the end of the day bet thatll fix itself  marisha oh thats true  liam yeah we are because when we write the name down its actually the zemnian word for no so  even if theres nine people then  travis youre overthinking it caleb  marisha its a double entendre  laura and taliesin lets go  ashley wait we havent eaten oh yes we have sorry  laura lots 
none	 of pocket bacon  taliesin we ordered coffee were still waiting on coffee is there going to be a desert was  there a desert menu can i get a container eggs never keep anyway  matt you gather your things finish off the remainder of your lackluster breakfast at this  point now the morning air is chilled though there is still humidity that permeates the swamp  vicinity you hear the bugs beginning to grow louder with the distant cicadacricket sounds in  the distance echoing through the swamp there is a low fog that is fairly prominent 
none	 this early in the  morning you can see about 15 or 20 feet beyond the barrier of the outer swamp before the moisture  begins to pick up you see just the shaded trunks of trees beyond that for another 60 or so feet  before it becomes completely obscured by fog  laura whoa its creepy  taliesin does it always do that  matt this time of year it does its just getting close to winter  marisha do we have basically zero visibility  matt not zero visibility you have traveling about 30 feet of general 
none	 visibility and then it  begins to get a little bit beyond that at this point febron chimes in dont worry it burns off  a bit as the day goes on  travis febron any suggestions whether to move through the muck fine land or through the trees  matt i mean were going to go through all of it really but were going to head for the  outside of the ounterloch  travis the where  matt the ounterloch  marisha ounterloch  liam under the lake  matt were heading towards the lake were going to 
none	 try and make our way around the outskirts of  it but were going to have to coast through the swamp to get there that way were not trudging  through the main central area too much  sam are we taking the cart or just going on foot  matt oh i wouldnt recommend taking that with us no  travis well leave it itll be fine daughter  sam sure papa may i have my allowance now  travis no youve been naughty no  ashley notty  mark hes a very stern dad  sam he is 
none	 but fair  matt as you guys are plotting a means out there kiri has the dagger out and is practicing little  swings excitedly  laura yeah kill all of it kill the fog kiri  matt then she goes charging towards the fog  travis and gets eaten  marisha aww damn it  matt its the mist  travis jesters regret  laura i have to live with this for the rest of my life  matt kiri has run past the barrier of the puddles on the north side of the city and is now swinging 
none	  wildly into the fog  laura oh shit kiri come back kiri  matt marisha and ashley singing kiri come back  matt runs back feet leaving a trail behind as shes stepping through two to three inches of  swamp water across this district chirping  laura you have to be careful theres lots of creatures around that could hurt you you know  matt theres lots of creatures around that could hurt you  liam you always want to stick together you never want to split the party  ashley yeah stay close stay close to us 
none	  matt she gets right behind yasha and sticks right to her back with the dagger out on the opposite side  going  laura we should really give her like a sheath or something to put that knife away fjord  travis i think you tell kids to run with scissors shell be fine can we check to make  sure nobodys following us as were heading out  matt make a perception check  travis plus four 16  matt you take a moment to scout the vicinity at this point in the morning its maybe about nine 
town	  oclock or so judging by where you can see the source of sunlight in the somewhat clouded sky  glancing around the city not a lot of folks are moving it seems like the nature of the swamp town  is a little bit of a slower pace of living by the nature of the location the few folks that are  wandering around the streets are slowly getting to their daily chores and business no one seems to  be particularly interested a few folks look over because you are a gathered motley crew on the edge  
town	 of town but theres no one who seems to be very focused in whats going on  marisha were the bestlooking people in this town and thats saying something  liam this group is very inclined were very skilled in arcane things what is your specialty  mark oh well you know how some people learn magic from books and some people get magic from  gods and stuff right  liam gods and stuff ja okay  mark my magic comes from just me the draconic blood im told has magical essences to it  liam yes cool what 
none	 can you do with it  mark well i dont know if i should its a lot of fire and acid mainly that seems to be related  to the type of dragon im from  liam ja effective  mark i can conjure fire i can make a lot of fire varying of degrees of fire really and acid  liam do you have maybe one bside besides the fire  mark besides fire and acid a little bit of poi i can drain life force and invigorate myself a  little bit  liam okay  marisha say 
none	 fire one more time  mark fire  marisha thank you  matt fire fire fire fire chirping  mark what kind of magic do you specialize in mr caleb  matt wrapped around his weenie  travis good pull  mark you have magic with that is that like an implement or something  travis deep pull already that was like 40 minutes ago  mark you said that crows are really smart so im guessing she knows what  liam theres so much quicksand in this swamp im feeling trapped i feel like we have a little bit 
none	  of overlap you know im able to  laura he has lots of fire  mark really you dont have any dragon blood in you do you  liam nein  mark oh thats good  taliesin and sam nine dragons  mark you meant the zemnian nein not the number  liam step off tiamat  taliesin well done thats a good joke  matt so we good to go ready to move the longer we take the more risk we run of getting there  about nighttime and i would feel a bit nervous about that to

none	 onto your head like a kid  taliesin just feathers in your face  liam i like where we are positioned what do you think  mark ill go wherever you need me to mr fjord said that im to do whatever so ill go wherever  laura how does she know theres a j in your name really  travis i honestly dont have an answer for that  mark i was pretty sure you said fjord but okay  sam were all pretty sure about that  travis you said it right its ford  mark thanks mr 
none	 ford  sam its meester ford  mark meester ford all right sure  matt like cali meester ford  travis oh jesus kiri all right lets go  matt at this point febrons like all right so looking out this direction this time of day  that way lead on big boy  travis all right youre actually going to be scouting right  marisha yeah yeah yeah  matt as you guys begin to step past the outskirts of the puddles your feet begin to sink thicker  and thicker into the swamp floor as you further and 
none	 further step away from this little bastion of  civilization with each progressive footstep you can see the waves ripple past and then hit patches  of thick elevated vegetation thats growing and rotting in small clusters simultaneously the tree  trunks that are faded shadows begin to come into view and you begin to see these twisted gnarled  trees covered in vines that dangle down from these high boughs that barely cluster out sections of  sunlight and you pass out underneath those areas where bits of cloud begin to break through  liam it was a joke 
none	  matt ah gotcha  liam i said hi beaus  matt ah boughs  liam i know but i said hi beaus  travis three out of five  matt yeah its fine in pushing this forward and guiding the path im going to have febron and  whoever is keeping watch on the exterior to both make survival checks  marisha what do you mean on the exterior  sam im keeping watch on the right  marisha im keeping watch up front  ashley im looking on the back  liam the gators come from the left 
none	  matt right well this isnt a perception check this is to make their way through the swamp to  keep track of whats ahead so im having febron and one of you take point on that  travis beau  marisha what kind of a check is this  liam survival  matt this is a survival check  marisha okay oh i thought it was actually higher when i first looked at it 17  matt actually you both rolled pretty high over the next two hours or so you guys manage to keep  for the most 
none	 part above any of the deeper recesses of marsh water leaping from cluster of tree base  and sections of ground that are mostly above the water line it manages to go through without much  of an issue the fog does slowly begin to burn off as the hours progress but its still present you  gather probably about the time you arrived at the end of day yesterday to the exterior of the  labenda swamp there was just a faint bit of fog at the ground it will be a number of hours before  you even 
none	 reach that point but it is progressing towards a more visible space these two hours you  guys continue forward being mindful and watching around those who are keeping watch i need both  of you to make perception checks or one of you make it with advantage your choice  marisha its me and who  matt whoever else is keeping a watch you want to make it nott  sam yeah  matt go for it  marisha do you want to make it with advantage or separate  sam nah one  marisha its not great for 
none	 me either six  laura oh jeez louise  sam clear on the right  marisha clear on the front  travis right front  marisha shouting clear on the left man which way am i looking  sam i dont know  travis its really reassuring when theres a question mark on the end of your statement  liam this is generally how it goes  matt febron at this points still looking he says wait hold on a second he starts doing a  little circle in the area checking out some of the recent trees looking at 
tavern	 the sun in the sky  and hes like yeah i feel like were going the right way  taliesin wait just to be clear your job your only job was to walk to a building and back for  god knows how many years and you think were going the right way  matt yeah we dont usually leave this early in the morning  travis are you still drunk  matt noncommittal grunt  taliesin do you need to be drunk  matt yeah  liam and ashley nott  sam what  liam not a problem bren 
none	 would you help our friend out  sam oh yes its me bren yeah ill be right over  mark shes oblivious completely lost shes looking around like  sam febron do you have any cups i dont want you to  matt he pulls out a halffilled wineskin opens it up pours the water out  sam have some booze ill fill it to the brim  matt he looks curiously at the flask and the amount of liquid you poured in there  sam cheers  matt cheers indeed tiny girl he watches as you drink the alcohol 
none	 and is confused gets a  closer look at you at this point and he goes  taliesin now is not the time to start making judgments sir  matt right  taliesin does that clear your memory  matt aye its this way make another survival check  mark mr fjord youre very liberal with your parenting  marisha dont fuck me sunny  laura its just milk  mark oh that makes sense  marisha man thats really frustrating seven  taliesin did you both roll  marisha huh  matt well it was febron and beau  
none	 marisha seven not good i keep getting so close  taliesin do we not get advantage  matt well this one theyre doing it individually because you have somebody outside  of along the path as you guys are progressing for the next hour or so febron and beau are  keeping pace on this keeping watch moving forward you step through some of the soggier  areas of the swamp and your foot gets stuck a bit and its starting to get a little more difficult  to traverse febrons like its just a few more hours and well 
none	 make our way to the outskirts of  the lake itll be a lot easier then trust me itll be fine  marisha sorry  mark sounds great  matt at this point fjord as you are stepping near the front you come around the corner and  without notice theres this strange sound this airy puff and theres a cloud of pollenlike  spores in the air right where you are i need you to make a wisdom saving throw please  laura and ashley oh no  sam hes very wise hell be fine  travis oh jeez 
none	  mark thats always a good sign  travis 14  matt you manage to pull back coughing a bit and your head goes dazed for a moment but you manage  to shrug it off you guys look ahead and beyond the area where fjord was pushing around one of the  trees you can see this large 30foot wide cloud of yellowish pollen that went airy puff and  slowly settles into the swamp area  mark blimey  travis can we see a source where it came from a plant or a  matt theres a whole 
none	 mess of twisted vines and plant matter in the center of the space where it  seemed to emit from the center though you do see one large ferntype plant thats left open and  three or four large leaves that are spread outward  travis i think that doesnt look very hospitable  marisha febron  laura we should avoid those huh  marisha yeah is this a thing that happens im assuming  matt i havent actually seen this close to one of them i usually avoid them so lets avoid it eh  mark hello mr fjord 
none	  travis yeah  mark i dont know if this is do you want me to burn it all away  travis cali that is a very good idea  mark like that area right is that where it came from  travis i mean hoping the pollens not flammable but sure try it  mark is it flammable mr creepy pervert  matt first off i resent that  mark do you  matt no  taliesin i think the mr was pretty respectable all things considered  matt ill take that i mean i figure its probably in 
none	 the way burn it if you can i dont  trust it  mark how wide radius is this area  matt this vicinity is about 30 feet around this particular plant in the center thats lying open  face to the sky  mark 20foot radius would  matt it would encompass the plant definitely  mark fireball the dragon claw comes out and this green flame magic coalesces she flicks out  this green orb that fires down and when it hits it detonates  laura wow  matt it emits this large blast of orangishred fire that 
none	 burns in the area go ahead and roll  damage  mark can i have a d6 from somebody i need six more  marisha theres three  taliesin feel free to dive through the bag for anything you need  laura dang it im trying to get to my bag to help you but  matt shes filled with a baby  liam babys in the way get used to it  laura i cant bend whoa  mark im taking that its a six  laura yes  sam hes a high roller  matt and marisha ooh 
none	  mark thats very good thats going to be 28 points  matt 28 points of fire damage this explosion immediately evaporates the fog in the area and a  large part of the ground now is dried off you see this mist or steam hiss out of where the  detonation happened the plant in the center which is now more visible you can see snap shut  this giant three four part maw closes in the space with these plantlike teeth its still  there writhing in pain from the explosion it laxes open a bit and begins 
none	 to shift in your  direction it looks hurt but still alive  travis caleb  marisha it moves  laura sacred flame  liam fire bolt  matt all right fire bolt sacred flame thats cocked thats a 15  laura dex save  matt 15 yeah so no sacred flame but  liam 17 for fire bolt  matt 17 hits roll damage  liam okay that is not that much actually  laura that was a dex check yes  matt yes or no yeah for sacred flame yeah  liam that is a 12  matt 
none	 12  liam yes  matt 12 points of damage as you slam it with the fire bolt it shrieks and keeps moving forward  but its hurt  laura toll the dead  matt rolled another 15  laura damn it  liam if you give me six second increments im just going to go releasing spells  mark when its within 60 feet i can acid splash it as well  taliesin just for fun infernal stay down  sam jesus  matt 16 sorry  taliesin some days you cant get rid of a bomb  travis 
none	 ill give it a whirl ill reach up near my eye and you see this little arc of energy pop  out from my eye towards my hand ill throw it forward and cast witch bolt  sam witch bolt  laura and ashley ooh  liam which bolt do you cast  matt you guys are all preparing your various cantrips and spells against it it begins lurching  forward you can see the charred edges of this large vegetable plant then fjord steps forward  sending this arc of darker graygreen energy that strikes into it roll damage 
none	 roll to hit first  travis oh thank you yeah ten plus six 16  matt 16 hits  travis okay great this is overkill its 3d12  sam oh shit  travis thats nine  marisha wow  liam good rolls  travis 27 points of damage  matt as it strikes this large traplike plant it hits the center of it it bubbles up for a  second the green and red matter of the interior swells and then pops like a horrible fleshfilled  water balloon spatters across various areas you guys have to take a step 
none	 back and it glides  against your knees and thighs a bit  mark can i use shape water to keep it out of my way my cantrip just disgusted groan  matt it just manages to avoid you but it lies now decimated and sinking slowly into the swamp  water  mark oh sorry i thought id kill it the first time im sorry you had to do that  travis no it was a really encouraging display i was not expecting it to be so durable  mark yeah me neither i thought it was just a 
none	 plant  laura we should really avoid those in the future huh  liam well thats one in an entire swamp of vegetation so we should be good now  sam hows it going over there guys  mark no theres going to be loads of plants mr caleb  taliesin anything on the right  liam that is correct  sam nope all clear  marisha anything on the left  taliesin right  marisha no im asking for anything on the left  matt make a perception check  marisha thank you  taliesin is there somebody on 
none	 the left  travis not anymore with these rolls  marisha nine  matt who else wants to make a perception check  laura i would  marisha i roll obnoxiously bad  sam yeah  taliesin whoa  laura woohoo 13  matt 13 okay a brief breeze blows through the swamp as you guys move on from this positioning  you hear a very faint hiss through the distant branches of the trees singing in unison as bits  of leaves and vines clatter against themselves from the shift but you manage to catch a sound  upon 
none	 the wind that is unfamiliar to the rest of the natural breeze its like a chime like a wooden  chime dull thunks  laura whispering i hear something  mark whispering what do you hear  laura i hear a chime  taliesin gong  laura no like little wind chimes like we had at home  mark oh that sounds nice  laura yeah  mark it cant be anything bad  laura we used to hang them in our balconies  matt you can listen up and can hear it for a moment too as the breeze 
none	 blows through a second  time kiri makes the same sound dull thunks  laura it sounded like that  taliesin well done  marisha oh yeah the little bamboo ones those are great  matt looks like its a little bit northward of where youre headed a little north  laura febron is that where the thing is that were going  matt i mean it could be  liam north is that way  matt its loosely on the way if you trust it we could avoid it though  laura oh so its not the safe house 
none	 its another building for sure  matt i dont know what the hell that is i havent heard that out here before  laura we should find out what it is  travis i actually tend to agree i dont want to leave things undiscovered  matt are you sure about that  marisha what did we pay you for  matt im helping you  travis are you  marisha its questionable its honestly debatable  mark he seems to be doing his best  matt thank you  mark dont thank me youre weird  liam frumpkin im 
none	 going to sit on a relatively dry spot if i can find one im going to go blind  and deaf and send frumpkin in the direction with jesters help towards the sound that she heard  mark i make it drier for caleb using shape water dry out some of the area  matt sure you cause some of the swamp mass to pull back a bit  laura thats cool  travis surf pro  matt frumpkin takes a little bit because this terrain is not very conducive to prowling cats of  frumpkins size but frumpkin heads 
none	 on for a bit coming across the source of this sound you see  about 100 or so feet ahead in the direction where you heard the sound hanging from one of the  branches there is indeed a cluster of carved chimes that are dangling from a piece of twine  there theyre banging into each other every now and then when the breeze slowly comes through  laura just in a tree  matt on a branch yeah  laura oh thats creepy  liam i will give the group a basic narration as i see these things 
none	  matt you can give a perception check for frumpkin  liam my basic perception check is not too bad it is a 16  matt 16 okay from frumpkins view underneath you can get a close look at it and the material  of the chimes isnt wood it appears to be yellowed old dried hollowed bone the twine  itself is not twine it appears to have been tanned or dried sinew  travis disgusted oh yeah  liam what was that word  matt sinew  travis super inviting just all the tendons  laura our wind 
none	 chimes were made of wood  liam how much of it are frumpkin and i looking at its one little ditty or are we talking true  detective here  matt currently its just the one chime  laura does frumpkin see anything around like any living things  liam i dont hear shit  marisha true  taliesin does this sound like some sort of ward against the undead  matt it doesnt catch your mind as anything that is a defensive mechanism to undead that you would  recognize  liam its hanging from a tree  matt 
none	 it is about seven feet above frumpkin  liam i am going to send frumpkin up the tree  matt okay  liam i am going to send frumpkin toward the branch  matt frumpkin manages to climb the tree using the outside of the somewhat twisted bark getting to  the top from that viewing point as frumpkin gets out there you can laughs  laura do you want to hold my hand i try to hold calebs hand  travis cat growling  sam its clammy  matt you do see from the top of the branch beyond 
none	 the edge of the fog there looks to be a  thick tree that has broken and fallen over about ten feet from the base the heavy roots rise up  into this trunk that still stands about nine or ten feet from the base of the swamp floor it  appears like there is a hollow carved into it circular and a curtain that is currently pressed  bolted or nailed into it that is partially blocking an opening into the tree  liam like sealed or nailed in so its hanging down  matt its hanging down and 
none	 every now and then a faint breeze comes through and you see it shift  ever so slightly but its a heavy material  liam okay what i would like to attempt to do is send frumpkin up to and stick his head inside and  as soon as i get a little peekypoo snap my fingers and bamf him out into the fey  matt okay as frumpkin make a stealth check  ashley come on caleb  marisha come on frumpy  laura lumpy frumpy  liam a big 13  matt okay good to know  laura 
none	 its really good  matt it is better than 12  marisha a bakers dozen  liam remember when i used to get a 45  matt frumpkin stalks up through avoiding the sleight depressed elements of the floor that fill  with the thicker bog water coming upon the outskirts you can see the curtain that hangs is  not cloth it appears to be a scaled leatherlike material actually pretty similar to what you had  carved from the crocodile the day before but long weathered and its dry towards the top but the  base of it 
none	 seems to have been progressively moistened by the swamp around it as such its  slightly decomposing and it has a bit of moss and algae thats grown on it giving it a lighter  green at the tip looking inside there is a layer of bones that are all broken and chipped to the  point where its given a textured base to the floor from this view youre not able to make out  what the bone source is or what theyre from but there is a gentle layer of bones of varying  degrees of age to 
none	 them within there you also see there is natural rot on the inside of this  trunk thats let it easily be carved away there appears to be a matted pile of something in the  corner other than that in the brief instant that frumpkins paying attention it appears to be empty  laura that pile was definitely something sleeping  matt frumpkin returns to his realm  liam oh yeah like i was saying to you there is a tree out there and there is something sleeping  in it  travis did you hear anything snoring  
none	 liam no but there are a lot of bones there they looked like  laura what kind of bones  liam they are not chicken bones  laura like gator bones maybe though  liam well they were probably smaller than that yeah  matt you didnt get a good long look at them you literally got in quickly and went poof  travis jester bones arent normally a very good sign  mark that doesnt seem very good  liam there was something in the corner something that was not bones but it wasnt moving  laura i bet 
none	 it was a friendly person  liam it definitely wasnt the thing were looking for  travis you didnt happen to see a bowl did you  liam i did not see a bowl i made a perception check  matt in the brief instant you looked in there you got a few details in the interior before  pulling way  liam yes not bowls just bones  laura ill tell you what lets go to the safe house and then well come back if we are not  completely almost dead and see what we see there  
none	 liam save it for a rainy day  travis very wise  laura especially if there is no bowl in the safe house then we know some other place to look for it  liam this ones a gimme a bonus only if we feel up to it  mark youre all so brave  travis do you think well be able to find our way back here should we mark a tree or something like that  laura lets mark a tree  taliesin ive got that  marisha cause fabron doesnt seem to know which way his ass 
none	 is so  matt thats not true at all  travis which ways your ass  matt its right here  liam north is  matt its that way  liam north is no it is that way  matt thats what i said  liam youre pointing over there im pointing over here north is that way  matt yeah  taliesin im going to pull out my sword and im going to carve into the side of the tree a big  sign that says here lies salty pete with an arrow down straight below  mark whos 
none	 salty pete  taliesin i dont know but it sounds like something awful happened to him doesnt it  mark aw thats really sad  taliesin do you have a way of magically marking this as well so we can have a bit of a compass  liam a compass  taliesin yeah like a point can you do a thing where you can put a pin in this tree  mark can you do that mr caleb  liam well a couple things one this is a compass  taliesin thats true never mind  laura oh well find 
none	 our way back  liam thats not an issue but if you want to know if somethings happening here with salty pete we  can also do that if you give me ten minutes but it doesnt seem like thats what youre  taliesin no thats not fair as long as we can make our way back here again one way or the other  and i suppose thats true  liam i do not know where the safe house is but anywhere we have been we can get to again  travis fair enough  laura singing lets go 
none	 to the safe house then  matt you continue moving on  travis lead on  matt febron goes all right that way and he points in the direction and ushers you forward  travis you did a good job the first time lets take it up again  marisha all right  matt what pace are you moving at normal pace slow pace fast pace  sam we always move at a medium pace  matt okay medium pace it is  laura wait hold on let me look at what i have i could cast pass without a 
none	 trace on anyone within  30 feet of me  matt you could you have to move at a slow pace to move stealthily though  travis i think our speed is halved in the conditions right  matt for the most of it yeah  laura oh so it would be super slow  travis doing the slomo game  laura well maybe not then maybe when we go back to the creepy tree we can do that  matt as you continue on febron and beau are you the other one with febron doing the survival checks  
none	 marisha i think so  matt make one more  marisha dont fuck me gil natural 20 gil  matt as you guys begin to watch the treeline slowly thin febrons like oh its a good sign  were getting very close to getting out of this fucking swamp and getting next to the ounterloch  thatll lead us there no issue no more of this right as hes saying that you watch him about to  step into another one of those open plants that begins to quake and you watch as its about to  release this burst 
none	 of pollen beau  marisha i go oh youre about to watch it  matt you dont stop him you just point it out it goes puffing  sam nice hes dead  matt he goes what coughing and starts walking straight towards it  marisha oh i grab him can i reach out and grab him trying to cover my mouth  matt make an athletics check for you to try and grapple him  marisha either that or we lose our shithole guide  travis which is really not losing much at this point  marisha no okay 
none	 we lose our 100 gold investment athletics right  matt acrobatics sorry athletics for you to grapple him  marisha okay ooh nope its worse than i thought its real bad its an eight  matt you reach and grab him but he shrugs off your arm and starts walking  mark as hes about to step can i cast levitate on him and lift him up into the air he doesnt  step on it with the claw the green magic comes out and whoosh up into the air  matt he continues to walk towards it and then 
none	 glides up in the air and is floating hes  reaching towards it and the plant slurping and is trying to reach for him  marisha i take my staff and bat him away like a helium balloon just start batting him back over  away from it  matt hes now floating and slowly rotating in the air like grunting  mark ill be raising him up and down shaking him in the air like come on shake out of it come on  travis maybe we try to outmaneuver this one now  taliesin yeah i think weve 
none	 already had our fun with the one  laura i open my journal and start drawing him as a balloon  sam hold on were not done  taliesin no theres a lot happening over there  matt it takes you the better part of a minute to finally shake him out of it before he goes oh  is it what shit yelling shit whats going on  laura shushing  matt the plants still below him going like slurping  mark ms beau could you nudge him off to the side im getting tired of this  matt 
none	 you poke him and he begins to glide over  mark then ill lower him down  matt the plant is now turning towards him slowly shifting in his direction and hes like backing  away theres a fucking  marisha can i now grab him by the collar and try and drag him away  matt yeah you move around the side and you pull him away  marisha come on  matt you guys begin to pick up your pace this plant is not very fastmoving and you even  moving at your slower pace it cant keep 
none	 up with you and it eventually gives up and disappears into  the fog behind you  taliesin the loneliest plant  matt i love that you roll a 20 to see it before him and and went sure  marisha yeah  matt i love it its great  marisha watch your step man ah  matt yeah all righty  liam febron youve been through this swamp once or many times  matt ive been through it a few times but usually its with a group of other smugglers and  they take care of me and protect 
none	 me like you are thank you  liam its a bit late in the game but are you being completely forthright with us is he  mark youre welcome  matt make an insight check  liam that is a natural one  matt its hard to read  liam can i make a suggestion febron and i cast suggestion on febron  matt okay  liam i feel you should be completely honest with us from this point on because you know honesty  its the easiest thing to remember  matt you know i appreciate that i dont 
none	 appreciate you casting spells to fuck with all my  mind and shit but ive been honest im going to make some honest coin and im doing my fucking  best all right now come on its this way  liam its that way  matt stuttering not north where were going at this point you guys can see the very edge of  the water is now starting to show through the fog and you can see where bits of the lake are hitting the  shoreline and you have reached the ounterloch in the middle of the labenda 
none	 swamp  laura hey theres a lake  taliesin with that life delivers a pleasant surprise  laura febron  matt yeah  laura are there monsters in this lake  matt i dont know i dont go into it i recommend not getting too close just in case we  usually stay right on the coastal side of it you know  laura okay  matt perfect  laura splashing  matt no whatre you doing no shit  laura then i go back out i just wanted to see  matt the whole time youre doing that kiris 
none	 like chirping whos keeping watch on this  sam keeping watch  matt yes  sam what do you mean  matt i need you and probably beau since you were with febron before make a perception check please  travis ooh 17 plus one 18  marisha ten  matt okay as you guys are trudging along on the bank of this lake heading northward fjord out  of the corner of your eye you see a shadow shift in the trees to the left of you you glance back  and you see something disappear behind a tree 
none	 about 40 50 feet off  travis hold i saw movement off to our side 40 to 50 feet into the trees  sam which side  matt to the left side  sam theres nothing over here on my side  mark should we pretend like we havent seen it we should just carry on as normal  marisha no thats not just no one move  mark okay  laura we just freeze  travis fan out a little bit  liam if we dont move thats also a little weird  travis yeah fan out who wants 
none	 to move towards it with me  ashley i will move towards it with you  mark ill come  ashley ill take out my blade  mark ill come with you  liam i walk in the opposite direction  taliesin fighters move forward magic peoples hang back  laura maybe i shouldnt move forward  matt so you guys are heading towards the shadow you saw  travis yasha molly cali and fjord well walk towards it  laura i stay right where i am  travis but fan out not together maybe ten 15 feet in between 
none	 us like a fire line  liam lets go i say as i walk backwards  matt fjord molly and yasha like that  mark im going as well  matt and beau  mark and cali right  liam that mini  travis but fanned fire line  liam oh the tails there  marisha look at you  all ooh  mark that was a real rush job that i had to order a day before i flew out  marisha youre smexy  liam just pull it over here for a second  matt you begin to 
none	 turn and approach and you guys form your line moving forward you watch as  something lumbering moves its still on the edge of the fog and it shifts from the tree where it  was to a tree further back and then ducks behind another tree its not very stealthy though it  thinks it might be  travis is it moving fast easily in this terrain  matt it seems to be moving fairly easily in the terrain  laura what is it  liam as gollum what is it  mark as gollum what did you say 
none	  marisha all right im going to stealthily do some monk footsteps up to it a bit  laura maybe its something nice  marisha see if i can get a better look  matt okay make a stealth check  marisha oh my god 14  laura whats happening  matt okay as you tiptoe through the edges leaping from cluster of root to cluster of root  being as quiet as you can you come around the first tree where this figure had vanished look  around to where its currently waiting and you see two trees that 
none	 grew together and a large rock  thats wedged at the base of it crouched below behind the rock you see this bulbous humanoid  creature with a deep greenblue skin tone with little pustules and boils on it at the edges of  the shoulder and arm you see long stringy black hair that goes past the front of the chest the  torso appears to be swollen this belly protruding beyond it you can see hanging around the neck  other pieces of hollowed bone very similar to that chime that you saw being described by caleb  
none	 marisha is it a troll  matt it appears to be trollish in nature the pustules and part of its body theres this thick  green liquid thats oozing out in places its sitting there clinging to the rock with its long  fingers clutching it looking over in the direction of where you were breathing heavy  marisha does he see the mighty nein  matt it seems to be looking in the direction where you were  marisha but he doesnt see me  matt he doesnt see you at the moment no  travis whispering do not 
none	 see me  marisha how far away am i from him  matt youre about 35 feet from it  marisha could i theoretically throw something behind him  matt you could certainly try  marisha yeah sure im going to take out a handful of ball bearings and try and toss them  matt make a sleight of hand check to do so without making a very visible toss  laura yeah right no sound at all  marisha 24 22  matt you take the handful and lob them quietly as far as you can you hear very 
none	 faint impacts of  them about 25 30 feet off the trollish creature goes snarling and pushes off the rock a bit  looking that direction looks over the rock looks back in that direction its now looking like hes  paranoid and keeping tabs on both sides  marisha im going to stealth back  matt make another stealth check  marisha 19  matt you manage pull back to the rest of the group as you guys are holding your line waiting  for beau to return  marisha its a troll like a  travis toucan with 
none	 a belly  ashley hes got a beak  marisha no hes like a troll  laura loudly what are you saying beau  travis shh jester  marisha i think he knows were here but hes a slimy undead trolllike guy  mark that sounds really bad lets not go near it  marisha i also think he might be who lives in that hut  sam how do you know that  marisha because he looked bony  mark thats a reasonable deduction  laura loudly maybe theres lots of them around too  sam shut up jester

none	 edge of where the lake is beyond the treeline being  stealthy here means being quiet but youre still very much out in the open  liam so youre saying theres a chance  matt im saying if an entity knows youre there if youre not trying to obscure your visual  youre going to have a hard time avoiding it  sam should we create a distraction for it first  taliesin lets just pay attention and if it starts getting close then well deal with it  were just not going to let it escape were just going 
none	 to keep an eye out for it  marisha it might be better if we move quicker through here as well instead of stealthily  mark im sure if you pray to the platinum dragon well be all right  liam inaudible chanting  matt as you guys push on febrons looking extremely nervous now that youve mentioned this  creature wait are you saying you saw this troll thing over there  travis heard of something like that around here  matt only heard rumors and we talk about various things that live out there trolls is definitely  
none	 one of them  marisha how long have you lived here  matt through the ages there have been all sorts of stories theres uglier trolls here swamp  trolls mountain trolls all types and this one it wouldnt surprise me i havent seen one but i  stay perfectly quiet quieter than you usually do as a group im just going to stay here and  clings behind you fjord like as a shield  travis yeah i dont know if thats going to work for me all right lets get moving try and  ignore this  matt 
none	 you guys move on taking care to be quiet but not out of sight if you want to be stealthy  in that regard make a stealth check  travis well give him a chance whether he engages or not  marisha we wanted to move faster  matt so then no stealth  travis no stealth  matt so you guys continue pushing forward at your regular pace  travis maybe a little faster than our regular too  mark that was really brave by the way you sneaking off like that and finding it out  marisha thank 
none	 you youre so complimentary it makes me a little nauseous  mark i was raised and people were really nice to me they used to tell me i was special and how  important i was and it made me feel nice so i try and do that for everyone else  marisha man thats so sweet ugh where are you from  mark thank you technically i was born in port damali but i didnt spend a lot of time there i  lived on the streets on my own and then i was taken in by some people 
none	  marisha really  travis some people  mark yeah i guess you guys have been nice to me i can tell you know i mentioned those folks  in the dragon masks the cult they were the ones that raised me  liam thats the first time youre introducing the word cult into conversation  mark oh sorry yeah  sam youre a cultist  mark no i was raised by them  marisha youre an excultist  liam cult adjacent  mark i guess i mean  sam cultish  marik cultish maybe  matt like nott youre 
none	 a cultist youre a cultist  mark all right stop bird stop saying that word i dont like it  taliesin did you have your own mask or do they just wear masks out of curiosity  mark i didnt get a mask because i wasnt allowed out they kept me in the temple its because they  were bad all right im glad that im not with them anymore theyre bad people  liam so they did this to you  mark no ive always been like this  marisha they worshiped you  mark yeah they told me 
none	 i was special i was important to them somehow  matt yasha and fjord as theyre having this conversation youre watching at the flanks and  you can see the shape of that troll creature is still moving from tree to tree keeping pace with  your movement  ashley fjord  travis i saw it what do you want to do  ashley theres one of him and however the fuck many of us  liam how far back is he  travis not too far  matt its not approaching you but its keeping pace  marisha were 
none	 on rough terrain right now  matt youre not in the center of the swamp where its a lot of shifting topography and roots and  vines and patches of deep water you have to come across youre along the coast of this lake so  its mainly soggy dirt and sand so its not rough terrain where you are  marisha but where he is it would be considered rough terrain  matt yes but you also have no protection youre literally out in the open  marisha we can try to send someone ahead as bait lure him 
none	 out fight him on steady ground  travis or we could just keep letting him match  laura the thing is what if something bad comes in front of us and then they trap us because hes  just following us  mark why isnt he attacking us  laura maybe he has friends ahead that hes waiting on  taliesin i tend to find things that live in trees filled with bones tend to not have necessarily many  friends im just putting it out there i have nothing else to base that off of but it didnt  
none	 look like a very social creature  liam so if we feel like we want to get into a scrap i or probably our new friend here could  kick it off from a ways away  travis we could or jester youre pretty friendly you want to see if  laura its a friend  liam the troll  marisha he had green pusy ooze pouring out of holes in his face just want to throw that out there  sam you could heal him and curry favor with him  laura i could if i made myself look 
none	 like a little teeny troll and they would want to be friends  with me  marisha i got undead vibes from this guy  liam also you are very charming but every book that i have ever read about trolls they do not  make friends they are bitter nasty things  ashley they eat you if youre little you know  marisha he definitely had like a collarbone just hanging out  taliesin can i see him from here  matt make a perception check  taliesin seven  matt you do not  taliesin do i technically 
none	 have advantage because its trying to perceive an undead creature  matt no because you dont know if this creatures undead or not  sam what if we set a trap or an ambush for him or her  marisha thats what i literally just said  sam we could do a little circleypoo and put cali in the middle as bait and then when it comes to  attack we spring the trap  travis whats the trap made of  sam i dont know ive been drinking a lot  laura what if we ran rope between a 
none	 couple trees and then we tripped it  liam its watching us right now isnt it  marisha he probably is hearing everything were talking about  liam debatable whether it can understand us but perhaps it can  laura man trolls are so cool  travis okay how about this yasha im sure youll agree we can make one move to see if its  interested in nonviolence and then we have the advantage here now  ashley i like that idea a lot yeah i would agree  travis i dont like being tailed in particular  sam 
none	 someone walks up to it while the others flank around  laura do you want me to do it fjord  travis dont you  laura here you hold kiri then because i dont want her to get too close to it  matt chirping  laura what are you doing why are you holding  sam and laura no put her down  mark you wouldnt hold your own daughter that way  matt like nott its me bren chirping pulls the dagger out  sam ill take kiri give me kiri come here little kiri my father wont 
none	 hurt you anymore  mark im going to stand closer to bren im disappointed in you mr fjord  travis that means literally nothing to me  marisha shes so formal in her admonishment man it kind of makes me feel bad anyway lets go  ill flank to the north  laura is the troll just watching all of you go away  matt if youre doing this stealthily then i need anyone whos trying to not be seen to make a  stealth check  laura should i try to pass without a trace you guys  travis 
none	 i dont think we should stealth  sam its not an ambush if they can see where we are  travis fuck the ambush theres nine of us one of him  sam that you know of  liam i would in fact like to try to walk behind a tree so im obscured  marisha im going to stealth to the north  taliesin ill join you in the nonstealthing  matt beaus stealthing to the north which will be here fjord you guys are heading inward  travis molly yasha and i will not be stealthing and heading 
none	 inward and well be just behind  jesters diplomatic envoy  liam i dont know if it can see me or not but i would like to hold magic missile in case it  attacks my friends  ashley i want to be close enough to jester in case anything happens  matt jester where are you standing  laura i guess i will be falling back because im going to talk to him  taliesin youll be going in front of us because youre going to talk to him  laura i thought the thing was behind us  
none	 matt you guys are heading northward this way you guys have to go this way because the lakes all  this direction  mark im stood next to nott with kiri  matt nott and kiri are back here and that would be go off to that side febron is like im  going to stay back here with the people in the backback because i want to stay in the back  travis sarcastically oh no i was enjoying our closeness  matt you guys begin to trudge in deeper into the swamp  laura okay im going to 
none	 pull the last of my pastries which im sure are really fucking gross  by now  matt yeah theyre pretty stale youre fine as you begin to move into the swamp you do see the  shape and its about maybe 60 or so feet from where you are you watch it shift and then shift  to another tree a little further away  marisha hes moving away from us  matt hes moving away from you  travis are we sure its the same one  matt make a perception check  travis 17  matt you 
none	 see one shape move its similar to the one you saw before you can ascertain that it  probably is the same creature yeah  marisha okay we do not want to follow this bunny rabbit down the hole  laura im going to invoke duplicity and im going to send my duplicate towards the troll its skipping  liam singing peters theme from peter and the wolf  travis yes perfect  matt make a deception check no you dont need to after that well see if he can see through the  illusion it skips ahead just keeps 
none	 walking in that direction  laura towards the trees looking like shes picking some vegetation i doubt theres flowers  travis mushrooms  laura but whatever yeah whatever she can do  matt 50 feet 60 feet gets relatively close to where you saw the shape vanish  laura im going to have her turn her back to the troll and act like shes digging around in the mud  matt from behind the tree one of the claws the long stringy hair dangling somewhat stuck to its  neck shifting with the light breeze that blows through as it 
none	 looks back and watches the illusion  turn and shift is it relatively close to the tree the illusion  laura pretty close  matt it sits there and waits shifts  laura im going to have her take a couple of steps away from the tree  matt it shifts back in its space a little bit  laura shes going to step back towards the tree  matt as soon as it gets within about five or so feet the illusion the troll creature reaches out  and swings out to grab the illusion passes through and the 
none	 claws slash into the tree it  goes frantic grunting and then vanishes behind the tree you watch it dart the shadow of it  vanish behind another tree and its moving further away from where you are  laura dont think it was friendly  travis question answered did it move away  laura yeah  travis do you want to chase it  laura i think we should stick to the safe house what do you guys think  travis i think thats a good call  taliesin for now  travis well stagger back towards the back 
none	 line of our group  marisha yeah continue on  laura ill keep the invoke duplicity the second me skipping through the swamp at a distance  matt how long does that last lasts for a minute  laura invoke duplicity lasts i think a minute yeah  matt you guys cluster together outside of the swamp alongside the curvature of the lake keeping  an eye on the side you continue to travel forward the lake slowly begins to as you guys  are heading northward along its side it begins to curve to a northeastern direction and febrons 
none	  like all right so this is good were getting closer to the northern side of the lake which  means were getting close to where we follow the pearl blades to the safe house good okay at  this point you look over to the side whos keeping a watch on this okay both of you guys  roll a perception check please  marisha motherfucker my perception is balls  travis 15  marisha nine  laura beau needs to stop looking out for things  matt 15 you said you do see the shape now keeping pace 
none	 with you again same distance out  there its stalking you but its definitely you get the sense based on the interaction you  had earlier and the distance its keeping its not interested in fighting nine of you its  waiting to pick one of you off and take it wherever its going to take it its smart enough  to know that its not going to jump into a fray in the open space but its definitely waiting to see  what weaker one stays to the back  ashley can we put some of the little ones 
none	 nott bren get in the middle kiri  sam yep on my way  ashley im going to get in the back  matt you guys continue heading in a northeastern direction until eventually you watch the lake come  to a northern peak and begin to curve back into a southern area it looks like the top of the lake  bends to a point northward and then begins to head southward and level out at this point febron  goes all right good from here we head northward into the swamp were looking for  daggers with pearl 
none	 hilts in the trees those are the markers theres six of them that lead us  there hes going to make a perception check he looks a bit lost someone want to help him out  with this  laura yeah ill look  matt make a perception check as well  laura 12 i think yeah  matt it takes you a moment but you manage to catch the third or fourth tree into the  treeline and you see a gleaming pearlhilted dagger that is jammed about five feet off the  ground into one of the thicker 
none	 pieces of tree bark on the exterior of one of these trees its this  little mark that looks like someone jammed a whittling knife into it and left it there and he  goes thats one good okay that means were going the right way  liam do you see it show me  laura its right here its at eye level with me  liam good  matt moving up looking for the next one go ahead and roll  laura ooh thats better thats a 23  matt both of you go there at the same time 
none	  matt and laura ah chuckling  matt all right second one moving on looking for the third  laura that was a one for me i dont see it  matt this one takes a little longer to find all right  laura but i dont wander too far from everyone else because theres a troll out there you guys  matt yeah you find the third febron finds the fourth  laura i find that last one  matt fifth one because he did not find it but you locate it  laura 23  matt yeah with 
none	 that point he goes okay im pretty sure were almost there he points ahead  and you can see where theres a cluster of trees a new sight catches your attention the first  thing that hits you is this faint scent of rotting flesh it hits your nose a bit and your eyes  sting water for the moment as your vision focuses on the first corpse a human man propped  up on a spear going up through the side of his torso and out his left pectoral his stomach is  bloated and his skin is dull 
none	 gray and glistening his jaw hangs open his expression this horrible  ghastly grimace a few feet from him stuck to one of the trees you see a halfling woman with two  blades jammed through her shoulders pinning her up legs dangling but one leg is partially torn  off her head is mounted down hair in her face so you cant make out any features and theyre both  placed up there right against this opening to a small clearing ahead and this is where febron  goes and thats what im talking about thats the warning whoever 
none	 did this is trying to keep us out  laura you havent gone past these  matt fuck no  laura shh quietly they could be around hey you guys i could try this thing that ive been  wanting to do for a while which is where i can talk to somebody that is not alive anymore  sam you can do that  laura yeah the travelers teaching me all about it and i think i can do it  mark is the traveler another wizard  laura he kind of is but hes really powerful and hes 
none	 super cool  liam settle in  laura he wears this really cool cloak and hes got an amazing voice actually hold on i pull  out one of my pamphlets here if you want to learn more you just let me know  travis maybe we can get back to talking to the dead people  laura yeah do you want me to try it  sam that sounds like a great idea  taliesin nott why dont we check for traps too  sam oh thats my job  marisha how long does it take you to talk 
none	 to dead people  laura its instantaneous but i can talk to them for about ten minutes or so  sam anyone whos dead or just one dead person  laura just one dead person that i cast it on  sam which body is fresher matthew  matt from what youre looking at theyre both about as fresh as the other  travis which ones got the better mouth  laura it doesnt have to be fresh it could be really old  matt they both have their jaws intact from what you can tell the female halfling you 
none	 cant make  out the features of the face because the hair is in the way and dangling the other ones is open  laura which one looks friendlier  matt they both look pretty dead  sam let me check for traps on the smaller one  matt make an investigation check  sam oh a lot 25  matt no traps nothing like that you do notice there are wounds across the body beyond the leg  missing there are a number of wounds you can make a medicine check to try and ascertain what they are  
none	 sam ten  matt okay they seem to be a combination of bite and claw marks not super deep slashing but  definitely a gash across the shoulder the neck there is one large puncture wound about that wide  thats right around where the sternum is but whatever punctured it one of the edges is torn  out like something hooked was placed in and then pulled through dragging the flesh with it  sam does her face look like  matt intact  sam yeah we dont know this person right  matt no you do not recognize 
none	 this person lifeless you do see some rough elements of  tattoos along the neck similar to the banded neck tattoos of members of the gentlemans crew that  you had seen before not as thick and dense but you can see that there is a pattern to the  acquisition of some of these tattoos for the ones who run the smuggling line youre starting to  ascertain and put that together but intact  sam would you like to talk to this one  laura i mean sure  sam well let me introduce you  laura okay 
none	  sam this is my friend jester  laura hi  sam jester this is a dead body  laura im nervous ive never done this before  taliesin this should be good  laura okay im going to hold my symbol of the traveler  marisha im going to keep a lookout while she does this  laura im going to be like okay im going to do this thing  sam just be confident  matt kiri pulls a blade and gets behind cali and is like like jester ive never done this before  laura kiri be 
none	 careful  matt like jester be careful  laura hey you dead person hey i would like if you would come to life again a little bit and tell  us some things that we want to know  tongue waggling  surprised yell  screaming  matt you watch as a tiny dagger goes into the tree next to it and kiris around calis going  travis easy kiri easy settle settle  matt cawing whimpering  mark yeah kiri settle  matt as the chest breathes in some of the air escapes some of the wounds and theres 
none	 bits of matter  mark retching  matt the head settles down and looks right  marisha yasha and her gag reflex  ashley oh no its happening again it feels like its coming up  matt febron leaps back hes like shit and backs up a little bit he looks really  uncomfortable with this whole thing you dont think he was prepared for any sort of deadraising  circumstance is this fucking necromancy  laura well kind of  matt he keeps backing away now the corpses face of this halfling woman turns towards you  inhaling  
none	 laura tongue waggling we have to ask it some questions  low monotone what did this to you  sam i dont think you have to talk like youre dead  laura really are you sure though have you ever talked to a dead person  sam ive never done it you know more about this than me  matt whispered voice swamp fishmen  from under the ground  laura beau are you writing this down  marisha swamp fishman from underground  mark that is incredibly specific and really useful  laughter  laura how many swamp fishmen

none	 many bleeds  mark if it bleeds we can kill them  marisha so when you cut it it bleeds got it  sam one more question  laura i get one more question what should i ask  matt kiri comes up and grabs the dagger wedges it out of the tree and turns to cali and goes  like cali if it bleeds we can kill it points it back to the corpse  laura dont kill it again okay kiri its okay we have another question  sam either where this happened or where they were hiding 
none	  taliesin where did it happen inside or where did they come from  travis underground  taliesin but did they come from the house or from outside the safe house or inside  mark could you word it in a way where you ask all of those in one question like did you come from  this this or this maybe and then well know where  sam or we could ask if theres a secret entrance to the safe house  taliesin what if there isnt  sam then weve wasted a question  taliesin thats fair  
none	 mark but we know theres not a secret entrance  travis did any of it precede the attack  laura or we could ask it what its childhood was like  sam that would be an interesting story im going to check behind us and see how far back fermaw  whats his name febron  matt febron  sam how far back has febron gone  matt hes 20 feet behind you hes keeping a little back from the whole undead thing  sam hey febron dont go too far theres a troll back there  matt at which

none	 legs while it has this bulbous swollen midsection  these thin froglike legs are giving these fairly decent leaps from section to section its other  arm grasping onto the trees as it runs you can see this is definitely its home terrain as these  magic missiles swarm out and slam into its body with each impact that green ichor sprays across  febron and it starts to burn into his skin hes screaming  travis xenomorph blood  laura oh no  travis is he unconscious is he done is that it  matt febron goes limp  
none	 cheering and groaning  matt i rolled 2d8 i rolled eight on each of them that was the reaction there  mark dexterity saving throw for the acid splash as well if you dont mind  matt correct thats a four  mark seven  matt seven points of acid got it as it slams it begins to burn the back of the skin you watch  a bit of steam rise off of its shoulder it definitely is wounding the creature this large  swollen troll is still making a break i need everyone to roll initiative now

none	 to do a full 60foot run  marisha i couldnt jump one more and try to get him a little  laura i dont think hes going down with it  matt at this point the fact that you guys are having a hard time hitting it and the rate that  its healing youre starting to think  marisha oh hes healing  matt yeah  travis dont you dare tell us what were starting to think  matt im just saying you can continue to pursue if you want to  marisha no  laura but wed be 
none	 idiots  mark but the implication is you really dont  sam we know where he lives  travis yeah thats right we know where his hovel is so lesson learned  laura oh theres a dead person im talking to  sam we have one more question  laura i turn around and run back to the dead person  travis beau is just you fucking  marisha yeah im doggypaddling through the air  sam will you let our friend down  mark oh yeah sorry ms beau  marisha i slow fall  travis still one more 
none	 question  liam matt were still in the middle of nowhere at this point or were  matt you guys are right at the edge of where these bodies have been propped up as a warning  which from what febron told you was placed up to prevent people from coming towards the safe house  liam we dont have our guide anymore ask this one which way to go  laura oh this isnt the safe house  sam this is the gate of the safe house  matt youre starting to get close to it as far as 
none	 you know  liam as far as we know  marisha if these are the warnings  sam specific directions  laura all right i guess thats what ill ask it then because thats all i can ask  matt as you approach the head is tracking you the whole time  laura sorry we got distracted there was a troll that came and stole our guide i think you might  have known him anyway which way is the actual safe house that were trying to get to  matt the head curves off to the right between the 
none	 tree that its stapled to and the other body  thats propped up 100 feet that way  laura oh shit we totally could have seen it  sam i can see it its right there  matt you dont see any safe house you dont see anything like that at that point the head sighs  continues back  laura well at least we know its 100 feet so we can search for it  taliesin are there actual knives stuck in  matt looks to be two shortswords have been jammed into it  taliesin shortswords or daggers 
none	  matt shortswords  laura do they have anything in their pockets  matt make an investigation check  taliesin yeah were looting these bodies right now thats nice  laura investigation you say 14  matt okay rummaging through the pockets and the various baubles you can find you find four pieces  of gold a handful of about 12 silver this is on the halfling a charm looks like its made from  a dried animal foot of some kind like a dog or a coyote  taliesin hiccups  matt imitates a hiccup  liam its cursed 
none	 hiccups  matt and a note thats keeping track of locations but its mostly soaked now and the ink  has all run and you make out bits of words here and there but it makes no sense to you  laura im taking it  sam give me the charm  laura are you going to check if its magic  sam yes  laura okay  sam i dont check if its magic  laura im going to use mending on the note oh wait it doesnt make the words come back  remember we already figured this

none	 trusted you motherfucker  liam i told you everything you have to die  matt utilizing detect magic you were saying  liam yeah  matt on  liam well its like blacklight so on everything on what they were looking at  matt nothing magical within what was found on the bodies no  liam is nott glowing in any kind of way that i am not used to  matt correct  travis how far does that extend  liam 30 feet i believe  travis it occurred to me from what your friend said that this location 
none	 might not be entirely  above ground any longer  laura mmhmm my dead friend yeah i think it might be hidden or something  travis yeah two hours past what was it noon  marisha two past noon  travis maybe it only becomes visible at a certain time  marisha four men required  liam you my good friend would you walk with me in the direction that the dead person said that  this entrance is in before my magic runs out  marisha why do you feel the need to call me a good friend  
dung	 liam youre right person that i work with would you walk over before my spell runs out so that i  can use it to help the group  marisha yeah  taliesin why dont we all head in that direction maybe in a large well knit group  travis since there are things thatll be snagging bitches when we get separated  mark is it dark or is it  matt no at this point its later afternoon maybe its like two or three oclock  marisha maybe like two past noon  matt maybe  liam caleb knows 
none	 exactly what time it is liam likes to burn his friends  sam caleb also likes to burn his friends  laura aw  taliesin singing one thing weve got it coming  matt you left early enough in the day where you arent threatened for dusk for another few hours  you guys continue on past the tree  liam towards the 100foot mark that the  sam should we scan for traps  laura probably  matt make an investigation check  mark calebs detect magic would probably pick up traces on my bracelet  matt thats true 
none	  liam so it glows  matt outside of the space around you or the trinkets found within the corpses nothing but  you do see the mild glow from the bracelet on calis arm  laura hey cali can i ask you a question  sam 19  mark sure jester  laura on check traps sorry  sam no go ahead  laura this bowl that were looking for  mark yep  laura you said it was used in rituals  mark i think it is yeah its more that i know that its part of a 
none	 set that i know this cult were  looking for and i want to stop them getting it  sam like a tea set  laura were you ever used in rituals with these bowls  mark kind of not ones involving this bowl but other rituals god this sounds really horrible to  say they werent nice people they kill people and i kind of helped them because i didnt know  any better you got to remember serissa the priestess who raised me she told me all this  stuff about the tyrant about the queen and i 
none	 thought that that was just what the world was  like you know i thought that that was good and she told me that these other people were bad and  thieves and that they were being killed for righteous purpose  laura who were the bad people  sam what queen  mark the scaled tyrant they call her the queen shes the queen of dragons five draconic heads  represent her and that kind of thing  sam so not a real queen  mark maybe shes a real queen i dont know i just always heard to 
none	 her referred to as the  queen  ashley she has five heads  mark thats what the stories say one for each color of dragon  liam would i know about this  matt make a religion check  laura oh i know about re no i dont know anything about religion  matt you can make a religion check if you want to try and recall information  liam 13  matt 13 youve heard of the scaled tyrant you dont know a whole lot of information but you  know through your research that one of the 
none	 entities that partook in elements of the calamity  liam obviously not part of the okayed deities of the empire  matt no not at all is definitely considered one of the betrayer gods in the calamity though very  selfish and is considered by many to be the patron whether it be the mother of or the  patron of chromatic dragons  mark serissa the priestess who found me she was nice to me but she would torture and kill people  in her name  laura what kind of people  mark merchants people who had things 
none	 the cult wanted and they wanted to take and they said it  was rightfully theirs but ive learned that its not anymore and yeah i helped them do that  thats why i want to stop these bowls i want to stop them doing this to other people  laura they are super evil bowls  mark i dont think so i think theyre like magically minor like a little bit magic but as  long as theyre not used by the wrong people they should be fine  ashley what do you plan to do with the bowl 
none	 once you get it  mark destroy it if i can take it and hide it somewhere that they cant find it they raised me  and i learned a lot and i know what theyre capable of and i feel responsible for the things i  helped them do so i feel like its my responsibility to stop them  ashley how was the bowl used in the ritual  mark its not one i was familiar with but i just know that its part of a set theres six of them  i think different things that they 
none	 all use  marisha are you trying to look for all six of them  mark if i can but theyre hard to find the cult works in shadows they keep themselves really  secretive i wasnt allowed outside of our temple where i was raised they gave me everything i  wanted but i wasnt allowed outside so i guess i can be a bit naive about a few things  laura i dont think being stuck inside makes you naive i mean i know some people that were stuck  inside that know lots of things  mark 
none	 really i hope that i can meet them i feel like i need to learn a lot more you know so many  people treat me i ask if i can trust them they say yes and then they trick me or they use me to  do bad things  laura thats not okay  mark i know right  liam shes talking about herself  travis cali do you plan to go back to port damali after this if youre successful  mark maybe yeah ill try and get away i guess ive got a friend there a 
none	 legionnaire he rescued  me hes a dwarf called grim im sure hed help me find a secure place for the artifact i dont  know yeah i guess ill try and find somewhere to hide them and keep on trying to stop these guys  travis absolutely well lets try our luck  liam it seems like a very large task for one person  matt at this point nott has completed quite a thorough sweep of the vicinity as you move  forward no traps you do notice as you head into this next open clearing theres thick 
none	 patches of  vines and roots that descend into a circular space that is awash with swamp water and general bog rot  that is floating over the surface like a moat has formed naturally around this giant banyan tree  about 30 or 40 feet across from side to side it is gargantuan the roots rise up and merge at  different places where the tree itself begins to expand about ten feet up before it reaches out and  curves and carves into the earth before disappearing beneath the water the still awful  swamp water that surrounds 
none	 it you also see across the front of its trunk in the vicinity at  least the bits where the sunlight comes through from the rather choked boughs above that are  shading the area quite heavily six more bodies tied to branches and roots with rope and vine  their bodies covered with similar wounds as the ones you inspected before some are slumped  against the base of the roots some are held up and vines wrapped around them and they are stapled  at an angle onto the sides of the tree theyre all currently placed as 
none	 a warning to either notify  or fend off anyone who would wander too close  laura i dont think the fish people like the safe house being here  marisha maybe they want the safe house for themselves  laura maybe this tree is sacred and it was being used as a safe house and thats not okay  travis certainly not welcome  taliesin would have been used as a safe house for awhile i imagine though  liam the tree is not giving off anything no  matt nope  laura cali can you make this water 
none	 around the tree go away  mark yeah actually i think i should be able to do something about that ill shape water and i  can push it around in a five foot cube so i can part it a little bit or i can turn it clear as well  matt you can part areas of it but its about 15 feet across as far as the width of it and it  changes in width depending on which place on the tree you head it is essentially a waistdeep  area of water so you could move 
none	 with it and  mark can i shallow it and disperse it so it still has water but it shrink it down five feet  so its not as deep to walk through  matt you can bring it to just past knee height within a very localized area to you  mark thats about the best i can do jester im sorry  laura oh no thats really impressive  sam i feel like caleb could have done it  laura caleb can you do that too  liam no i do not know how to do it  
none	 laura he cant do it nott  sam hes being modest he could do it  liam nott i have limitations i can do many things like you  sam bren  laura should we try to go towards the tree towards all the dead bodies  travis is the water around the tree in a circle like it pans out from around the side  matt kind of theres a big clearing around this tree its natural for the most part but it looks  like this area is centered around the tree  marisha do i see anything 
none	 like landmarks or anything out of place surrounding the tree  matt make a perception check  liam is the water up to our waist now  matt well no you havent submerged in the water yet but it looks about waist high as you lower  the water level  marisha its all right 14  matt you do glance up and see a band of teal fabric tied around one of the branches or the  edges of the roots at the top part about ten feet up that has been weathered and dirtied from just  being 
none	 there for a long time a lot of the color has faded but you just barely pick out its location  marisha its just one little ribbon  matt it looks like it might have been a bandana that was wrapped and tied around a root above  marisha im going to see if i can climb the tree and get to it  matt okay so you wade through the water  travis ill go with her just to accompany  taliesin nott do you want to walk on top of the water for a bit and keep an 
none	 eye for anything  underneath the surface  sam well what if something grabs me from under the surface  taliesin well what if something grabs you from the shore like a troll  travis or when if someone grabs you from the shore  sam all right ill walk around  mark is nott a nickname for bren  taliesin yes  mark that makes a lot more sense because you keep calling her nott and i just didnt get it  marisha sometimes we call her nott bren yeah  mark okay i mean sure  taliesin we 
tavern	 were drunk at the time it just sort of happened  liam shes as small as a tree knot you know so cute  mark oh well nott if im allowed to call you that  sam sure  mark i can make the water clear so that you can see if theres anything that could grab you  sam oh  marisha what was that thing you said about honesty earlier i cant remember  liam you dont know any of the fact that i almost killed you marisha ray  marisha im talking about before you almost killed 
none	 me when you had that great quote  about honesty earlier  matt beau make an athletics check to try and climb the tree  liam yeah what i was trying to do for us  travis easiest to remember  liam and laura yeah  mark my wisdom is eight so i cant pick up on any of this  matt athletics to climb the tree  laura huh damn  marisha eight  matt it takes a while to even get close but the general moisture in the air makes it slick and you  keep slipping down 
none	 the side  sam whats up there  marisha can i have fjord give me a boost  sam whats up there  matt you can try roll  travis theres a teal piece of fabric thats tied up on a branch  matt a tiny piece of teal fabric tied  sam how far up  matt eight to ten feet up  sam ill just reach it with my mage hand  matt popping noise do you untie it  sam yeah  matt okay you pull it and you bring it down its an old starched weathered 
none	 bandana  taliesin why dont you try pulling on the branch that it was tied to  sam all right  travis how deep is the water without the water being dispersed near the base of the tree  matt about three feet  taliesin the water is now crystal clear by the way  matt oh yeah so now the waters clear and you can see below theres thick sediment muck a few  bones of some wayward creature that long has been left to rot beneath the water but theres nothing  living in there aside from toads 
none	 tadpoles other small slithering natural creatures that call the swamp home  mark i will lower it now that ive seen its clear and ill say well im happy to step in  first you guys were kind enough to bring me im happy to step through and make sure its okay ill start  matt okay so you make your way through catching up to beau and fjord who are at the base of the  tree you get up to the base of the tree now the rest of you guys follow suit  laura yes  matt 
none	 you all cross past the water path youre now at the base of the tree you nott have the  strange teal faded scarf now in your grasp  sam its just a scarf  matt yeah  marisha nothing else has happened  sam you want me to pull on the branch  taliesin pull on the branch that it was tied to  ashley yeah maybe itll open something  sam ill pull on that branch  travis oh jeez  sam vigorously pull on it  liam maybe theres two branches  matt the gif machine  
none	 sam huh  matt the gif machine sam riegel  sam strained yelling  matt oh god the branch itself is pretty sturdy the portions of the tree here do not bend very  much and it doesnt seem to react the strength of the mage hand isnt very strong  laura are there any knots on the tree like underneath where the ribbon was  matt make an investigation check  taliesin what where did that even go  laura its right here  taliesin oh  laura 12  matt 12 yeah you glance around and as you 
none	 were placing your hands against part of it some of it  shifts it wobbles now getting a glance theres a piece of weathered driftwood or separate wood  that has been pressed up and tucked behind some of the roots to look like its part of the tree but  its a little bit of a different texture a different type of wood and as you press on it it  wiggles you shift it  taliesin traps  laura check for traps nott  sam all right  mark truly blessed with such wisdom  sam i will 
dung	 check for traps  matt make an investigation check  sam 16 16  matt 16 it does not appear to be trapped  laura im going to move it then  sam great  matt you wiggle it out pull it free and now you can see about a fourfoot carved hollow in the  tree that leads to a dark lightless interior  sam you did it  laura well you and beau and me did it  sam but you did it  laura aww  sam with my help  laura right  travis nicely done 
none	 whos first  marisha i almost died today motherfuckers i almost died  taliesin do you want to throw some light in here  sam that was calebs fault  marisha that was calebs fault exactly and i cant remember the thing he said about honesty and remembering  liam this is all meta conversation you guys have no idea that liam almost used the wrong spell  caleb was on point  mark i can go first and summon some light  laura you can do light  mark yeah  sam yeah caleb can do light too its 
none	 not the greatest  travis wait lets just hold on ill go in with darkvision without setting off any lights that  might herald them  laura what if theres traps on the inside though  travis then ill get hurt  mark matt ill cast light still behind these guys but it comes out of her draconic eye she  brushes her hair to the side and she has a yellow draconic eye on her left side  matt all right it glows like a torchlight in the vicinity  laura cali youre so cool  mark thanks jester 
none	 youre so cute i love it  laura thank you i love you  mark aww  matt as you step inside fjord you notice a fairly wellcleared interior that smells of marsh  water and lamp oil glancing about there are two hooks on the wall that have been jammed in that  carry the top part of some sort of oil lantern that has been shattered against the wall the  glass itself is broken the metal is bent and you now can see theres some soaked lamp oil that has  fallen from those impacts that has 
none	 hit the ground on the wall nearby and is offering that additional  smell to the room the floor is somewhat soggy with moss and bits of sand and gravel as well as  the occasional heavy root that breaks through the surface of that soft floor there are some pieces  of broken wood slats but besides that the chamber appears to be empty  travis i dont see anything inside here looks like there was a broken lamp so careful with fire  mark theres got to be more here right this cant be it  travis yeah 
none	 ill push in a little bit more  matt okay youre now stepping into the chamber the chambers about 30 feet wide its just round  travis looking up  matt you look up the ceilings about 12 feet tall and theres some hanging roots that are  dangling from the top it looks like its been carved away maybe  marisha does it feel like its bigger on the inside  matt no it matches the size its probably about two feet to three feet of thickness of the actual  tree trunk and the interiors hollow  travis 
none	 do i notice any furniture articles clothing  matt no make an investigation check if you want to  laura are there any trap doors on the floor  travis 17  matt okay a couple things though you dont have a sense of color are you the only one in the  chamber right now  travis i believe cali  ashley i was behind  taliesin yeah were in there as well  matt you went in there as well  mark yeah to give them light  matt right the rest of you guys step into the 
none	 chamber and the light comes in what you failed to  see because it was a change of color becomes immediately apparent there are scattered splashes  of blood across areas of the walls inside theyre dried but dried enough to the point where they  havent gone completely black and then disintegrated so this is relatively recent weeks  maybe as you guys are inspecting the space there are certain gashes against it looks like there  was definitely a fight and scuffle the soft ground here has signs of turbulent movement as  well as a number of 
none	 smeared grooves in the ground that snake and spiral about  liam are there any immediate threats in there fjord  travis not that i can see  matt fjord as youre glancing about answering this question you look down on the far north  corner of it and where some of the roots have gathered and come down theres one space where  you dont see the wall of the tree behind it as you move the root out of the way there is an  actual hole about two and a half feet wide that descends below the 
none	 tree  travis not any danger in the chamber but it looks like theres more to this room  mark does it look like they were dragging bodies down there the blood streaks and stuff  travis couldve been  mark do they lead there  marisha yeah do the tracks lead to the hole  matt there are some spatters of blood and there are some things that give the sign of being pulled  on as well as pieces and shards of wood including bits of porcelain some object that had shattered  and broken looks like whatever 
none	 may have been within this chamber at some point a lot of its  been brought down there  travis nott bren youre up  sam ive got to go down there  travis yep by yourself  laura thats where the fish people live are there fish scales on the ground  mark do you need light  matt make an investigation check  sam that would help  taliesin ill help with this one smelling the air for fishy oh doesnt matter anyway  laura 17  matt you do manage to pull through you do see a 
none	 small piece of thick scaled hide that was carved  off probably as part of a scuffle  laura fish skin  matt its pretty tough  laura its tough  matt its salty  laura its kind of salty  marisha tuna salmon  laura smells like fish  travis brackish flesh  laura im going to put it in my bag  travis gross  marisha before we go down or as these guys go down can i take a lap and look at the bodies on  the outside and see if i recognize any of them 
none	  matt recognize any of the bodies  marisha the six bodies  liam outside  matt okay glancing past and taking a look theres nobody that youve seen before that is  amongst this crew they all appear to be darkly dressed generally to keep out of sight you do  see two of the members there that have an accumulation of neck tattoos youve seen the ones  back in zadash that were almost full bands of designs these individuals have only sections of  it you start getting the idea that the more theyve worked with whatever 
none	 organization that  work this is the more completion theyve had of certain jobs depending on what the job is a  certain type of individual acquires tattoos as a sign of how long theyve been there and how  successful theyve been  marisha thats cool okay so they all seem like smugglers  matt at one point possibly  marisha can i do a quick round of their pockets  matt investigation check  marisha okay just real quick  matt with disadvantage because its quick  liam and puts light up in the tree out there with 
none	 her  matt whats that  liam im outside with her and im casting dancing lights into the trees so that she can see better  matt okay  marisha 13  matt 13 you manage to scrape away about 17 gold pieces and five silver pieces  marisha ill take that  matt before as you pull off of it you watch as the lower half of the body sloughs off the torso  and you back away  marisha sorry  matt the smell is awful as a lot of the interior gas of the bloated corpse escapes 
none	 into this  terrible sulfurous stench  sam gross  marisha oh god  liam please we have been around death plenty of times caleb throws up quietly into the water  taliesin do you go back and forth  travis well only one place to go and thats down  sam wait im just going to take a quick minute to stare into the eternal abyss of the dodecahedron  travis yeah sure  laura i just open up the bag so you can see it  sam oh my god what is in there  laura we dont 
none	 let cali see it sorry cali  matt okay you take a moment to focus and place your hand on this lightly thrumming device your  vision is pulled into this universal space of stars and gas and distant existences youve never  contemplated and there you see before you the pulsing light of possibility you reach out a hand  and grasp it and feel it enter your body and youve acquired your fragment of possibility  mark it doesnt take much to distract cali you just point over there and shes like  sam ill take a swig 
dung	 and go down the hole  matt the hole has chunks of rock and dirt as well as a very interwoven network of roots coming down  from the tree so its fairly easy to climb down there is a little bit of that damp water and  moisture that seeped into the chamber previously from just being near the swamp it wasnt a thick  layer of water maybe half an inch or so in the actual portions of the chamber and some of it is  now heading down as youre climbing down carefully through this hole you 
none	 can feel it  running down your back and its this cold swamp water i need you to make an athletics check as  you make your way down this chamber  sam not great just a check  matt yep just add your athletics  sam seven  matt seven okay you begin to grunts and you lose your grip and begin slide down like a slide  sam whispers yes screams  matt impact you get about maybe 15 or so feet before the back of the slide leaves you you have  darkvision so you see the 
none	 interior of some sort of chamber in the ground rocketing towards you  sam i will throw out a feather and cast feather fall  matt okay and you gingerly land on your feet no damage taken and no noise made either  sam breathing heavily  matt looking around you you see the inside of a natural rock chamber you can hear in the distance  a rummaging sound some shifting over from around the corner it seems like from where youre  landing the back is around you and then it curves to the left you see a 
none	 faint puddle before you  lose vision and beyond that you dont see anything but you hear shifting  sam coming towards me or just moving  matt just echoing around the side  sam cool  matt you hear a monster hissing  sam oh god  matt something clatter to the ground what are the rest of you guys doing  taliesin do we hear the slip and the whoosh  matt i dont think you heard anything no  laura we should send a message to nott and see what she sees  mark what bren  
none	 marisha nott bren yeah  liam yeah i can do that  mark bren are you down there hello  sam are you sending a message  liam yeah i am i have just joined the group how are you doing down there what do you see  sam i will reply to that message  liam with you and me it goes back and forth  sam theres a creature down here i dont want to make any noise if youre going to come down to  join me use a rope  liam all right we can do 
none	 that just stay put dont go rushing in without us  is it one or more than one  sam i dont know ill go rushing in and find out  liam thats the opposite of what i said  sam im going to gingerly creep around the corner  matt make a stealth check for me please  liam its hard to resist sneaking in  laura lets climb down  sam 15  matt you slowly make your way around the side this chamber appears to be kidney shaped it  curves around the bend and as you 
none	 make your way around the chamber at the outskirts of your  darkvision you begin to make out three shapes humanoid torsos with long fins that extend from  where the elbows are patchwork leather and bronze armor pieces as well as hints of shell jewelry  and bone you can see one face as you peek around the edge and you can see this large toothy  underbite with this square jaw where these four tendrils kind of dangle from the tip of its chin  a single fin curves over the top of its head no nose but 
none	 two gleaming eyes that refract what  little bit of light coming into the chamber from something out of the visual range is giving off a  faint glow the lower half of its body is a long fish tail it looks like that a nightmareish  merman would look like it sits there clutching some sort of long harpoonlike pike with a hook on  the end of it  sam are they waiting are they talking what are they doing  matt theyre talking amongst themselves and you hear some sort of tearing sound you peek around a 
none	  little further and you can see a creature has been dragged down here a familiar one a thick  leatheryscaled body of a crocodile of some kind not a large one but a regular sized crocodile has  been dragged down here and all three of them are in the process of feasting on its body theyre  tearing into its flesh and talking amongst themselves in a language you dont understand  around the base of them you see broken crates and a few odds and ends are  resting on the ground loosely discarded  sam any 
none	 other entrances or exits  matt from what you can see youre kind of peeking around the corner you cannot see the  opposite end of where this curvature is without possibly revealing yourself  liam it has been a while what would you like us to do  sam anywhere else to hide or something to hide behind  matt around that way not terribly there are a few outcropping walls and at this point i would  say i could probably give you a visual  liam already  travis i like what im hearing shark fins and 
none	 shit im a happy camper  sam while youre setting the stage ill message back up to them  marisha oh what is that what are they riding theyre riding like watery penises  matt nott youre right there curving around the side  sam did i come down right where i am  matt you landed right here and then made your way around this is where it drops you into the middle  of the chamber  sam got it ill radio back up to the top and say there are three mermen down here with  dangerous 
none	 weapons i am very outnumbered please come quickly you can reply to this message  liam yeah weve established that stay put dont move  sam ill cast mage hand and take a ball bearing across the way but not dropping it just holding  it in place just in case  matt okay so whos going down  liam i drop frumpkin down the shoot  sam oh jesus hes going to die  liam no hes not  laura thats not a long fall for a cat  travis were going to find out how far  marisha 
none	 not within like 50 feet  liam yes they can  matt yeah they can most of them make an acrobatics check for me  laura can we start tying a rope off upstairs and drop it down  matt sure  liam my acrobatics or the cats  matt the cats acrobatics  liam oh great hold on ive got that pulled up right here hold on  marisha are you going to land on your feet for the cat  liam 16  matt frumpkin lands  laura weve tied our ropes together and were going to go 
none	 down  matt okay  travis double knot  matt double knot all right  marisha i can go down first and make sure its secure on the other end  sam sailors knot  matt all right you make your way down the rope eventually you get to the bottom it does dangle  and the edge of the rope does basically end about a foot or two above where the ground is so  you just manage to catch the bottom so put how many ropes together two 50 feet ropes oh so no  its actually coiled 
none	 at the bottom total its about a 60foot way down you manage to make you  way down without an issue  marisha yeah i help anyone else down  matt okay so with the rope and everything aiding you down here its easy enough for you all  to make your way into this area  sam oh boy they have all of us all crammed up in this little space  laura what else are we going to do  taliesin im going to point out we cant retreat  laura why  matt kiris coming down with 
none	 you  sam no wait were not bringing kiri down are we are you guys bringing kiri down  liam i dont know  sam oh my god  laura we cant leave kiri up there who knows whats up there  matt are you guys having this conversation  taliesin no  laura we had it upstairs kiri  matt chirping  laura shushing sit in this corner  matt like cali i killed people  laura shushing no sit in the corner kiri right here  matt chirping  laura dont move unless something chases you  matt 
none	 like jester dont move unless something chases you  laura right  matt like jester right  ashley what if she dies  matt holds the dagger in front of her  taliesin shes upstairs  laura shes down here with us  ashley shes down here with us in the corner  laura right  matt yeah so kiri is going to go ahead and duck into this corner here  ashley shes better not die  liam oh wait kiri is down here with us in the corner  laura yeah  matt all right what are you 
none	 guys doing  laura lets kill the fish people  marisha okay were going to go were doing this  mark do you want me to start this explosively  laura yeah  marisha i mean  mark i mean im asking  travis it is kind of enclosed  liam well i think thats a great idea but we should also send bren with you and if you guys  could go simultaneous like maybe if bren hit one of them and then you follow right away  mark ooh it might manage the goods that bren told us 
none	 about that are around the corner like all  the crates and stuff i mean my bowls should be okay but are you here for something  liam sometimes im able to focus just shy of what im trying to target  mark oh its a pretty tight space around there im not sure i could try  marisha if your bowls are magical though they should survive right  mark yeah i know they should be fine but i mean for you guys what do you want  laura what if we all jump out at the same time 
none	 and scream and attack at the same time  travis i like that idea  marisha yeah lets ambush  laura like three two one  marisha quiet yell yeah  liam i still think that these two would be good to lead that charge  marisha give the explosive things  laura we shouldnt do explosive because  matt nott youre watching  sam uhoh somethings happening  matt you hear the splashing of water and out from the side another one emerges from this side pool  it speaking in aquan the other one speaking in aquan it 
none	 turns around and splashes back into  this little pool and vanishes below the surface  sam is there anyway to freeze the water or get rid of the water  marisha yeah dry up the water  liam are they still talking  matt briefly chatting but in the process of eating more than anything  mark i think i could freeze about fivefoot thats the amount i can do  sam theres a pool in the back there thats where they entered and exited from  matt its about ten square feet  mark i can freeze half 
none	 of it its oddly specific how much i can freeze  liam does anyone want to try to talk to these things or are we just cutting  mark they look like murderous fish men  travis were good to fuck them up i think  mark we could try  travis no i dont think thats a good idea  liam i like how that sounds like cali murderous fish men  mark murderous fish men  liam i love it  mark have any of you seen thor ragnarok  marisha yeah i was going to say you 
none	 sound like them i love it  travis i could blind them  sam dont you speak fish  travis what  sam youre half fish  mark youre half fish  travis im not half fish im halforc  sam he was born underwater  travis that is actually not true at all nott not at all  sam what is the other half  ashley youre halforc but whats the other half  travis halfhuman id assume  marisha and ashley you assume  liam were glossing over it but weve seen you vomit sea water twice  
none	 travis once  laura is this really the moment to talk about this  mark jesters really smart  ashley right nows the moment  travis right now  sam quick tell us your backstory  marisha you know how under pressure you can discover hidden talent maybe if you do this  youll be like oh i never knew this fishman side of me  matt everyone make a stealth check  laura oh jeez were losing our ambush yall  sam someone create a distraction well pop out and kill it  ashley i rolled a six

none	 aware that something is lurking in this area of it  sam it still doesnt see us right  liam for six seconds  matt no but its not an ambush round so top of the round is beau youre up  marisha can i hold my turn until fjord goes  matt you cant hold your turn you can hold an action  travis do what youre going to do  matt all the bad stealth checks were  liam big three  ashley big six  laura i got ten  matt ten right okay got it  
none	 ashley we die first  liam scheisse  marisha can i move into place and then hold my action until fjord goes  matt depending on what your action trigger is yeah  marisha i want to attack after he attacks after he casts a spell can i move in this corner  as far as i can  matt over here next to nott  marisha yeah im going to stealth yeah  matt yeah you can do that  marisha stealthing as fuck  matt okay and youre holding your action in case fjord attacks something  marisha 
none	 im going to hold my shurikens  matt okay so as youre pulling back with that fjord  travis im going to run around the corner give me that right over here yeah so i can see all  three of them at least  matt all right well youre going to be out in the open just so youre aware all right so you  move over here you can now see all three right there  travis sup fishfucks  laughter  matt yeah thats as far as you can move there they all turn growls you see 
none	 some of them  holding what looks to be these large harpoontrident things that are hooked on the end  and they have some sort of thick cabling of some kind attached to the end of it  travis arent yall pretty i look in the space in between them i see this ripple start to form  and i reach out with my hand and ill grasp at the space and tear a rip in reality and ill cast  hunger of hadar ripping this 20foot dome on the ground  matt 20foot radius where do you want to 
dung	 place it  travis ill put it right here so its actually no ill stick it right here yeah  because it halves it makes it difficult terrain so lets put it right there ish  matt you got it so you watch suddenly as the back end of that chamber well for those who can  see which caleb currently its mostly dark except for that faint faint glow around the  corner that you dont see the source theres no light in here that light goes out you are blind  at the moment because what little bit 
none	 of light there is has been consumed by this sphere of  darkness that fjord has summoned on the opposite side of the chamber you watch as reality tears  open in that space and you see these strange blackpurple otherworldly tentacles whip out from  the outside of it and you hear this horrible slithering sound within the center of that  chamber with this faint underlying of whispers and chanting  laura oh shit  matt does that do immediate damage or only on their turn  travis only if they start in it or if they end 
none	 their turn in it two different types of damage  matt cool all right so that ends your turn there molly youre up  marisha no its me i get to go first can i pop around the corner  matt let me see here real fast about the hunger of hadar spell  marisha i have my goggles on by the by  matt all right so you cannot see anything you have your goggles on  marisha but i still cant see  travis well actually it says the void is filled with a cacophony of soft whispers 
none	 no light  magical or otherwise can illuminate the area of the 20foot sphere  matt correct but you have darkvision  travis its just within the sphere theyre blind  matt correct so ill say you can see where they are but its a little obscured so  marisha okay im going to pop out can i pop out am i able to do that  matt you are well no im sorry you cannot move you did your move so you have to have an  action so you can only attack that one that you can see 
none	 there  marisha okay i will throw two  matt okay theyre at disadvantage because its beyond your 20foot initial range  marisha first one man ill take that 12 though for an 18 to hit  matt that does hit yeah  marisha and thats sorry seven damage on that one and then second one ooh those are double  fours which i dont believe hit  matt nope disappears into the darkness  marisha and then im going to take a ki point and cast i almost called it uncanny dodge  matt you had to do that 
none	 on your turn youve only got an action you were holding sorry  marisha okay  liam how highs the ceiling here  matt its about ten 11 feet its not very high  marisha i would have had to have said it earlier which i didnt know  matt all right that ends fjord and beaus turn molly  taliesin where am i lets see im over there im going to run as far as i can go towards fjord  and then im going to spend the rest of my action running across and get into that little 
none	 alcove  matt this one over here  taliesin no the other side of it im so sorry  laura no like behind that little  matt oh i see there we go  taliesin so positioning and ready for things to come  matt you still have a bonus if you want to  taliesin ive got nothing for my bonus  matt all right did you activate one of your scimitars  taliesin one is activated the other is not  matt got it cool that ends your turn it is now their turn so top of the 
none	 round theyre both in  the space so they take how much damage  travis they take 2d6  matt 2d6 cold damage  travis each of them do i roll that  matt you do so roll all at once  travis five four nine points of damage each cold impacts tentacle beating  matt laughs you hear this strange slamming and slithering sound and hissing noises on the inside  all righty so this ones going to go ahead and move just to the edge there  laura hes dead hes dead too late  liam thats how 
none	 it works  matt this guy gets to about there actually before he can move into the water right now  because they dont have a huge movement on land  travis and theyre in difficult terrain so its halved  matt exactly so those guys are clustered there that guy does manage to move  laura sweet then they end their turn  travis yeah you just send whatever youve got in the sphere trying to keep them in one spot  matt hes going to continue slithering the rest of the way counting  ill say it gets

none	 away its about to dive  back into the water and probably disappear into a subterranean tunnel thats filled  travis i stand up i get to my feet i touch the wound area and i fire it across the way  matt as you release your hand both bolts arc outward and slam into it from the back from the  front perspective it would look like guyver how he tears the chest and the beams come out but  instead its its internal organs being shoved out into the wall and theres two open holes  tombstonestyle before 
none	 it hits the water and slithers and sinks down into the small tunnel  liam twangy singing i got friends in eldritch places  laura wait did you say it fell into the hole  matt the impact hit it and began sucking  laura dont let it go into the hole  mark were out of initiative or are we  matt were out of initiative at this point  mark okay i run up and with the clawed hand she dives into try and grab this thing out of the pool  matt sure make a dexterity saving 
none	 throw to see if you can react quick enough  marisha can i assist for advantage  matt sure its less of a skill check its more of a reactionary thing so you wouldnt be able to  help with it  mark five  matt five okay youre trying to reach it but it sunk too low  marisha im going to take my staff and try the same thing  matt youre hitting stone and then nothing just water below  mark so when beaus doing that she turns around and snaps at beau rough voice get away

none	 about maybe 15 feet below the surface you  take a moment to dive under grab it and whether through a chain of hands or whatever because its  pretty heavy its a large body probably weighs close to 800 pounds so you guys have to all  together pull it up and it takes a few moments to do so but jesters pretty beefy  laura me and yasha basically got it out  matt between the two of you you eventually get it up back into the chamber  liam roughly a minute later i say so you 
none	 have been somewhat charmed by a circus carnie its  going to be okay  matt at which point the friends spell ends and you can feel an influence that was previously  there over your personality  liam you seemed a little angry he didnt mean anything by it  mark its fine its fine deep breath  liam just trying to keep everything copacetic and in order  mark i know thank you mr caleb thank you no its fine i do understand why its fine thank you  taliesin thought you needed a minute of clarity  
none	 mark its fine people normally react really worse when i go like that so its fine you guys  didnt beat me up you didnt try and kill me its great you guys are nice thank you  liam i mean you have a lot of scales on your face but look at this one look at this one look  at this one  taliesin this one less so  travis we can deal with tempers  liam that one as well  mark you all look fantastic shes so cute as well youre really lucky  laura and

none	 a bunch  of empty crates partially destroyed crates pushing aside the mostly torn apart corpse of this  crocodile and ignoring that you manage to find a number of gold and silver pieces that have been  scattered and lost and fallen into the sand digging through the natural gravel and sand floor  of this chamber you find that a lot of it has just been buried they werent interested in gold  pieces they werent interested in money a lot of that was left behind and scattered and has  been covered you take a moment to 
none	 pull through and you manage to acquire 185 gold 210 silver  pieces and 65 copper pieces  laura 210 silver you said  matt correct  liam distribute that equally however you would do that  laura okay well do some math  matt you find a bunch of jewelry necklaces and rings that are thrown about and lost  laura do you see any diamonds do you see 300 gold worth of diamonds  liam i put a bunch of jewelry into jesters hands  matt okay all the jewelry together would come to about just for purposes 
none	 of resale 250 gold worth  of jewelry there are no diamonds in there worth 300 gold sorry there are four sets of manacles  all manacles  marisha people are going to suspect things of us trading in manacles all the time these didnt work  taliesin the official currency of it nice manacles  matt the manacles are empty though they are bloody  laura you said four sets of manacles  matt yes four sets of bloody manacles  travis do they have any runeish markings on them or anything like that  matt no these do 
none	 not these are plain manacles  taliesin are they humanoid sized  matt roughly yeah there are a number of broken vials of some thick purple liquid but two of them  are not broken you rolled really high on your investigation so two vials of a thick purple  liquid roughly about that big its a thick oily substance  liam id like to take these for a moment or maybe ten moments  matt nott you see one thing helping caleb out and you pull it out it looks to be a wellcrafted  marble bowl of gold 
none	 inlay of a curious design the edges of the bowl shift into five multiple dragon  heads equally separated and in each dragon the eyes are tiny gemstones one sets rubies one  sets emeralds one sets sapphires one sets diamond  sam i will try to conceal this from cali  matt all righty make a sleight of hand check cali make a perception check  sam i will use my luck point  gasping  marisha you have luck oh it was the  sam 28  mark eight  laughter  travis we treat guests so well 
none	  mark thats what nott would do absolutely what nott would do  marisha youre so mean  mark shes just looking through the crates  matt looking through frantically you dont see anything there  mark im sure it was here  laura really people dont like it when you do these things sam  sam i just have to confer with caleb  marisha so cali i started a conversation earlier  mark hey ms beau  marisha which might be why you got so distracted you seem to have such an affinity for cute things  is 
none	 there a reason why you like cute things im not saying that not all of us like cute things we  all love cute things but you seem to really like cute things  mark i guess its just one of those things where and shes doing this as shes going  through the crates i was a kid and i used to ask for dolls and pets and stuff when i was growing up  and the cult used to give them to me serissa used to give them to me i dont know theres a lot of  
none	 bad stuff in the world and its nice to appreciate nice things sometimes i like having and finding  cute stuff do you not like that  marisha i just might appreciate some other things  mark your outfits cute though  marisha man thank you  mark thats all right youre welcome i was sure it was here i traced it i followed them i knew  that it was coming through this maybe i missed it maybe ive messed up  taliesin how deep is that pool  matt it gets about five or six feet deep  
none	 taliesin im going to search the bottom of it  matt make an investigation check with disadvantage  travis are there any weapons that the merrow dropped the hook or the spears or were they  tridents or anything  matt theres one of them that was a threepronged trident and two that were just long harpoons  theyre all hooked at the tips and they had this thick rope cable on the edge that they were using  to pull them back in  travis i pick up one of the tridents does it seem like an average  
none	 matt just a trident  liam i would propose i just rolled a 17 on perception to see if caleb noticed nott even do that  sam im going to come tell you anyways  liam well but you rolled a 28 so it would be super hard for anyone at the table to have seen it  matt yeah no one noticed nobody noticed  ashley im still keeping watch im watching the hole  laura i wanted to look in the pools too  taliesin can she give me advantage on that  matt sure usually you got 
none	 to tell me before you roll  taliesin i know we didnt want to interrupt the thing  matt thats fine  taliesin it doesnt matter anyway its eight  matt its brackish and thick and you dont find much of interest  taliesin check that other one too in a moment  matt you do find some bones  mark i can clear the water as well  matt looking through you find a number of discarded humanoid skeletons four of them to be  exact  taliesin the other one then  marisha maybe its in the next 
none	 room theres still another room  sam there is  laura they were coming from somewhere who knows there could be 20 of them on the other side of this  marisha its true could be a whole network of caverns  sam should we fill in the hole  taliesin i think were going to have to  marisha until we find  sam ooh we have thunder sticks  marisha we do have boom boom sticks  liam is this the end of our task here  matt fjord  laura were supposed to secure the safehouse  
none	 matt as theyre having this conversation you feel this strange crawling sensation in the back  of your head as youre looking past this pool down into the darkness below even though its clear  you can see the ripples and theres something gently tugging you in that direction and a  familiar voice creeps in sourceless within your brain that says learn  laura so anyway  sam we just killed fjords family  laura i feel like we should check and see if theres 20 of them on the other side of this thing  marisha or like 
none	 you said we just destroy the entrance to where they cant come through  taliesin dont we have a cat that can become a fish  marisha it takes time and equipment  travis plus some of us can swim we could pop down real quick and see whats down there  liam im taking those two purple vials and walking around the corner over this way to set  them down and start doing my thing and im going to start pulling out my book  sam i will join him  travis anyone else feel like going for 
none	 a swim  laura and taliesin yes  marisha i could probably join you for a swim  mark i need to check and make sure its not here and if there is a room back there i need to make  sure its not here  taliesin we dont know if theres going to be air on the other side of that though so we need  people that can  laura yeah one person that can breathe really well fjord you are familiar with the sea can  you hold your breath for a long time  travis 
none	 yeah pretty decent  laura all right how about you go  sam like forever  travis no  taliesin as long as you dont mind dying sure  sam do you have gills  ashley what if we tie a rope to you  travis sure we have an extra 50 feet we didnt really need the rest  laura should we take a short rest again oh its another hour  taliesin were going to do this  laura oh you can only do it once a day  matt what the  all short rest  matt 
none	 no short rest you can do as many times as you want yeah  mark its the long rest you can only do once every day  laura youre low on health still arent you  travis yeah but i mean were fine lets do it  marisha if you want to just swim and back youre going to swim and come back  travis yeah im going to go down and if i start running short on air ill come back up  taliesin well have a rope tied  laura im going to cast cure wounds on you 
none	 if were not going to take short rest if were not  going to take a short rest  travis no you dont need to do that theres no need jester well take a short rest afterwards  just a quick little recon  ashley here tie it around  travis i drop the rope and jump in  sam as theyre doing this im going to come up to caleb and tap him on the shoulder and say  caleb look what i found i think this is the bowl that cali was talking about  liam i instantly 
none	 cast identify it takes one minute on the two vials and the bowl  matt make a perception check  liam im over here  laura on the other side  matt you went all the way around the other side  mark i have a minus one its a 13 shes pretty oblivious  matt no theres no way  taliesin we are the worst people  mark as if i didnt know that coming in  liam we might be the third from the worst people  marisha as if i didnt know that coming here thats the 
none	 worst thing anyone has said about us  mark i know how the mighty nein works  matt the bowl is magical it is used as a communion device when granted with enough blood  and given the proper ritual its used to acquire auguries various bits of divination and  communication across the divine gate with whatever this scaled tyrant may be  liam but it needs a lot of blood  matt it needs enough to fill the bowl  laim i can tell from my identify spell that its purpose is to speak with this thing on 
none	 the other  side this deity  matt some sort of communion thats all you can make out from it  liam what about the vials  matt the vials are not magically enchanted  liam that sucks nothing to be told okay i dont want this  matt hold on identify should  sam you dont want the bowl  liam no  sam okay do you think its bad to give it to her  ashley im not there but  sam do you think its bad to give it to her  liam i dont know it 
none	 is not of any use to us i dont think  sam okay then lets give it to her  liam i stick it into my satchel for the time being  matt okay what are you guys doing youre underwater fjord youre swimming down going  through the darkness keeping your way there it goes under for about 30 feet 40 feet youre  pulling your way across the ceiling as it levels out curves a bit straightens lungs start to  hurt a little bit but youre still holding your breath okay pulling your way through this  
none	 darkness  laura this makes me feel so uncomfortable  taliesin im not okay with this  travis this is college all over again  matt you pull under and youre uncertain as to where itll end and that brief little peaking  fear in the back of your mind flashes and memories of being under the ocean of the  shipwreck of looking up and not knowing which direction was up that gives you this brief surge  of vertigo you stop for a second and a couple bubbles escape go ahead and make a constitution  saving throw 
dung	  travis 21  matt 21 you push through continue swim across swim learn you come up and all of a sudden  you can see now it begins to rise up once more and you begin to swim up pull across the front  and then suddenly your fingers break water but you do so carefully take a breath slowly as your  head emerges from the dark water in what is a large darkened chamber make a perception check  with disadvantage  travis six  matt you see where this 15 20foot pool that youve emerged from 
none	 opens up into this chamber  that is filled with low water and a number of divots and pools within the bars of land are  limited and thin you see from the peripheral of your vision before it ends at that point roughly  five or six more of these creatures you see a very faint glow in the distance a number of  objects that are piled and shoved into a central place you see elements old pieces of stone  structures that have fallen in this chamber inside here had a built or constructed purpose  long 
none	 ago and since has crumbled as the earth has shifted thats as much as you can make out  travis ill take a big breath blow it all the way out inhales deeply go back under push back  matt okay cool making your way through now you know the path is there the confidence because you  know there is air eventually helps you push through you make it halfway through  travis whats the depth like as im going through  matt its about 15 20 feet  travis so i can see the bottom  matt you 
none	 can see the bottom yeah  travis thats not so bad  matt you do manage to come out the other side emerge and take your breath now that youve been  through it once and managed to go through it a little more confidently you didnt have to worry  about holding your breath  laura oh my god are you okay  travis yeah theres another room theres five more of them if i remember  mark those things  travis yeah theres a whole other cavern theres ruins and objects and all sorts of stuff  were 
none	 not done with this by a damn sight  marisha our job was to secure the safehouse we can collapse this and say job done  travis there were so many things there were crates and objects  marisha that changes things  laura what if the safehouse is that other tunnel what if this whole thing is the safehouse  travis could be underneath it  liam what if its beyond even what fjord has just seen we do not know what we are talking about yet  travis we could guard this entrance and rest up for a 
none	 bit get ourselves together and carry  through its not that far i think everybody could make it i certainly could help somebody if  theyre not a very good swimmer but  marisha maybe run a line have the rope in case  liam you know we could rest up here on the back corner of this chamber i could cast my silver  thread across this pool here on the other side if anything comes through it wakes us up well be  ready we get ready for going further and  taliesin we could even cast the 
none	 thread and sleep upstairs  travis we could i know there are five but i think we use this funnel point as a fatal funnel  right we make them come through one at a time we send some bait bring them back through but only  when were ready what do you think  laura im okay with that  taliesin sure  travis cali  mark i want to help you guys i really do but if what im looking for is not here ive got to try  and find it ive got to stop these people 
none	 getting it the longer i spend here if its not here the  better chance they have of finding it and i cant let that happen  liam what if you spend one more night with us here  mark i really want to mr caleb like you all seem so nice and youre the first people i could  even say that ive made friends with but this is too important  laura i just cant believe we didnt find that bowl for you  mark maybe i messed up like i said im not very good in the 
none	 outside world and i thought that i  found it here but its fine  liam tell us again what do you need it for what are your intentions with it honestly look me in  the eye what do you mean to do with this thing when you find it  mark mr caleb i want to destroy it  liam how will you destroy it  mark to be honest with you i dont know i know ill find a way if i have to but i just the  biggest thing im afraid of is that the 
none	 cult and serissa theyll find somebody like me theyll  find somebody descended from an ancient dragon like i was then they can do this all again i got  away once i cant let that happen to someone else  liam yasha will you come here please  ashley yeah  liam i need your help mollymauk will you come here please  taliesin yeah sure  liam beauregard fjord will you come here please  marisha what  travis sure  liam i start to move away from cali  laura why dont you want me to come 
none	 here please  liam would you come back with me jester please  laura whatever  mark softly whats going on  liam once there is a defensive wall between me and cali i pull the bowl out of my bag  mark where did you find that  laura gasps caleb you found the bowl im so proud of you  liam no  matt jester voice im so proud of you  laura yeah kiris proud of you too  liam no kiri bren found the bowl cali i would like to help you but this thing is 
none	 powerful  mark yes  liam and i met you ten hours ago  mark mr caleb all i can tell you is that the whole reason i came here is to find that so let  me put it this way you care about these people you care about this group  liam yeah i do  mark then dont keep that thing the cult will find you i know more about them than you i can  hide i can stay away from them  liam well i have a wonderful compromise you know we can all camp 
none	 down here as i suggested  you included in the morning my good friend jester can get to the bottom of your intentions  for good for real  marisha calebs still holding the bowl  matt mmhmm  marisha can i snatch it out of his hand real quick  matt go ahead make a dexterity check opposed  marisha just a straight dex check  liam what do i do dex as well oh its gonna be so good  matt disadvantage for you because you werent expecting it  marisha its not great  liam thats a 
none	 two so i think this story is over aw the second one was an 18 aw three  marisha ten  matt the bowl leaves your hand now beaus holding it  marisha im playing a game of keepaway  travis are you natural beau or bigass beau  matt no its faded  marisha singsongy caleb  liam why would you not want to wait 12 hours to see if this womans intentions are true or not  laura what difference does it make  liam what difference does it make this bowl  laura you dont have it 
none	 in your hand anymore caleb  liam this bowl that i am talking about can be used to speak to one of the most evil entities in  the history of creation so i think it warrants another 12 hours of waiting to get to the bottom  of things  laura i dont think you should stop someone from talking to a god if they want to talk to a god  mark i dont want to talk to her i want to make that clear  ashley if you want to destroy it why dont we just destroy 
none	 it right here  taliesin i dont think it can be  mark i always thought youd need something more impressive to do that but if we can destroy it  here then so be it  liam i think it is going to be a little bit beyond your capabilities to destroy this bowl  yasha  ashley no i dont mean me  marisha caleb i respect you and all of your intentions but your caution does not get to  control other peoples destinies  liam that bowl is used for communicating with nervous laugh the mother 
none	 of dragons  mark are you going to rest now are we doing anything else are you resting now or do you wish  to take this time now  marisha you had no intentions of wanting this bowl or needing this bowl or caring about this  bowl until cali came around  liam beauregard you keep the bowl all night so that jester can use the spell she used in the past  for truth and then we ask cali and i would love to hear that calis intentions are true and good  if theyre not well 
none	 find out  laura i believe you cali i dont think i need to cast it on you  mark but you need to trust each other  taliesin actually heres an insane thing that occurred to me technically speaking charm person  lasts a really long time i cast friends  liam friends one minute  laura oh well i can cast charm person  mark you tried to cast something on your friend the guide right to make him tell the truth do  that on me i wont resist it i promise  taliesin thats fair im 
none	 into that  liam yeah okay i suggest you tell us the absolute truth of your intentions with this bowl  mark i dont want to resist it so i intend to either destroy it or find somewhere secure that  the cult of the caustic heart servants of the scaled tyrant cant find it because they knew my  power they knew that im descended from an ancient black dragon from far away if they find  another one like me they could do terrible things i promise you mr caleb i promise you  that all i want 
none	 is to right some of the wrongs that i once did as part of that group i helped  kill people i helped torture people ive got to make this right and thats the only way i can do  this i dont know much but i know that the only person that can take that thing and make sure its  not used for ill is me  taliesin mr caleb  sam snickers you have the helm  taliesin theres only so many burdens were expected to bear before were asking for failure  mark i dont want 
none	 you to have to bear this one  liam im glad for you to take it im a little surprised at the rest of you for me being  cautious but im glad for you to take it  mark thank you  taliesin oh no im with you  marisha i grab caleb drag him aside hand cali the bowl drag caleb over to a private corner and  i say look we all have our fucking trauma you understand that we all have our fucking garbage  and our dirt and our shit but you dont get to 
none	 use your skeletons in your closet your ptsd to  be shitty and control other people and what they want it does not make you the authority on whats  right and whats wrong just because you think that youre a shitty person guess what were all  fucking shitty people  laura not all of us are shitty  liam are we separate or are we not separate  matt shes not being subtle  marisha i get feeling like shitty people i dont speak for the rest of these guys but i get  feeling shitty but it 
none	 doesnt mean that you get to impress that on other people and make them feel  like shitheads just because you are  liam beauregard what if she had been lying to us  marisha then she fucking lied to us we take that and we learn that as a lesson for later on  mark ms beauregard if i can  marisha yes cali  mark i think out of everyone here from what ive seen mr caleb is the only one who really  understands how powerful this thing is even i didnt know as much i appreciate 
none	 everything that  youve just said and its the nicest thing that anyones ever done for me please dont blame him  he was doing the right thing  marisha im not blaming him its just that this isnt the first occurrence of something like this  with him either  mark i think hes trying to do the right thing  marisha i think he is too  mark okay  taliesin yelling you were right caleb youre just a shitty communicator  marisha its kind of what molly said  taliesin yelling yep  liam i told you 
town	 exactly what i wanted to do and why  marisha the road to hell is paved with good intentions  liam i dont know what youre talking about and i walk away from her without saying another word  marisha thats fair  mark im going to look at everybody i really wish i could help you with the rest of this but  ive got to get this thing away from you you know people will be after this as soon as i can  laura cali be careful theres trolls out there and gators  mark ill be 
none	 careful  travis cali im just curious you dont want to try and smash it on the ground real fast just for  shits and giggles  mark i can try  travis yeah i mean while were all here  taliesin ive never played with a magical item before  matt you throw it on the ground it rolls off untouched  mark ill try acid splash as well  matt all the acid runs off of it unscathed  travis yasha chuck that shit on the side of the wall will you  ashley wait is it magical 
none	  laura superduper  liam highly  ashley im going to try to take out my magicians judge sword because i can try to dispel magic  ill try to do it might not work  matt okay youre going to strike it as youre dispelling it is that what youre doing  ashley yeah  matt okay you hold your magicians judge up you lift it over your head and swing it down with all  your might go ahead and make the check for the dispel magic on the sword  ashley whats that  matt its under 
none	 the description of the sword on your app its a d20 plus not the attack roll  its under the ability  ashley cast as a 3rdlevel and the ability check bonus for the spell is plus three  matt yeah so roll and add three  ashley 13  matt 13 as you strike downward theres a brief moment where you see a flash of energy as if the  field is temporarily dissipating whatever magical connection this object holds in that brief  eversosubtle instance of time in which this marble bowl is left in a brief blip 
none	 in history it  is exposed to the elements the blade carves through and shatters the glow explosion for  that instance there is a brief burst of bright green blue red white black energy that  emanates and this low growling rumble and with that the bowl and whatever enchantment it held is gone  mark you did it  ashley sorry  mark no yasha you destroyed it thats exactly what i wanted to do i didnt think itd be possible  ashley i really didnt either i just  taliesin i owe you the biggest drink oh 
none	 my god  mark ms yasha though you need to be careful i mean that thing was connected to the scaled  tyrant and the cultists if they find out what youve done theyll come after you but i want you to  know ill do whatever i can to stop them  ashley well hey stutters i just i didnt think that was going to happen so fast to be  honest  mark i dont think any of us did  matt its interesting as it shattered and while youre having this conversation theres this  static electricity 
none	 around yasha occasionally as she brings her hand closer you watch as these  little bolts of energy are arcing through here as it slowly fades you can see theres a slight  faint glow of the symbol she holds at her belt that eventually goes mundane as well  mark can i rush over and hug yasha for what shes done i throw my arms around you draconic claw  piercing in a little bit  ashley i keep my arms down but i give her a pat  mark thank you so much you dont understand what this 
none	 means  ashley youre welcome im glad it was me and not you so you dont get in trouble or youre not  marked or anything  mark im sure that the scaled tyrant is looking for me in other ways but thank you you guys  ive never had people look after me and help me like this before you guys are probably the first  friends ive ever had where do you guys normally stay if i need to come and find you  travis were actually traveling all around i was going to ask where do you 
none	 go now since youve  achieved your objective  mark ill head back to port damali theres other artifacts i need to find and destroy but now i  know that they can be thats what im going to focus on  travis we might find our way down to the menagerie coast at some point and if we do well  give you a look  mark id really like that please  can i write to you if i leave letters can we be pen pals jester  laura oh my god i will send all the letters
