none	 made that  all yeah  sam what are you talking about  matt i have a problem well the problem is being a huge fan of the witcher series for a long time  but yeah thats our crazy halloweenness well kick back here in just a minute to start the game  and see what the wonders and dangers of whitestone bring to vox machina see you in just a second  laura were all going to die when were goofy looking  dramatic music  matt welcome back so to get you guys up to speed with 
none	 the current situation in our currently  nonair conditioned studio great day for this to coincide vox machina had an encounter with two  individuals known as the briarwoods lord and lady briarwood who currently control whitestone the  city that percival taliesins character once lived in his family once essentially ruled  before they were usurped and most of them murdered by the briarwoods so upon meeting them a  vengeance urge kicked up within percival the rest of the party following him to whitestone to  attempt to free the city from the clutches of the very seemingly 
tavern	 evil and in some cases undead  briarwoods as the lord briarwood appears to be vampiric in nature  after arriving they had some stealth missions they went around and discovered a fair warning on  the sun tree one of the central items of whitestone a relic of pelor from long ago that  the city was built around now dead and holding a series of bodies hung from it all dressed and  painted to look like the members of vox machina while they were there they managed to find and  hole up in an abandoned tavern 
none	 closing the windows off and after doing a little bit of  digging spoke to the head of the ladys chamber the temple to erathis to which percival and most  of the team seems to be interested in starting a rebellion in whitestone they planted the seed  there to return to germinate at some point and then began to follow a couple of individuals or  at least an individual that was partially responsible for the really honestly shitty social  atmosphere in whitestone following him back to a home it was discovered that sir kerrion one of 
none	  the individuals responsible for the death of percivals family was still part of the ruling  class here the party then snuck in through the bottom of the building stealthed into a full  surprise ambush upon him and his compatriots murdered most of them they took his toady  essentially vouk and instead of murdering him tore out his tongue and then burned the de rolo  family crest into his forehead  liam you say they not quite how i remember it  taliesin the way youre putting that is a lot worse than actually  matt 
tavern	 i know but its fun to push it that way  taliesin i feel this is a little onesided  matt but yeah with his tongue removed and the  symbol burned into his forehead he was thrown  out the window and the party then escaped into the night rain returning to their tavern and  that was where we left off so as you guys come in from the soakingwet rain that seemed to have  been now pouring continuously through the city of whitestone you come to the quiet of your tavern  the sun beginning to 
none	 find its way setting across the evening sky what would you like to do  liam im having a real hard time roleplaying right now  matt i dont know what you mean what are you doing vax come on  laura its actually really difficult to play a character when youre dressed as a different  character not going to lie  matt well were going to learn  laura were going to learn how to do it  marisha you wanna roleplay as the character youre dressed as yeah its hard  dont do that  travis i 
tavern	 dont know i feel as groggy as ever  matt i dont think scanlans going to have a problem tonight  sam nope this is how i imagine myself to be  liam i am not going to look at that table at all tonight all auditory for you three sorry  laura so we are wait i forget  matt you guys just now returned to the tavern  laura were in the tavern its nighttime now  matt its starting to push later into the evening now you guys have returned to the tavern  sam and as 
tavern	 we returned to the tavern did we see hustle and bustle of people rising up in  rebellion by any chance  matt not yet  marisha overnight rebellion  matt its been fairly fresh since you even started the word of it  travis we were very discreet and discreetly putting the dust of tracelessness on the ground  matt yes you were and youre finding your way through there doesnt appear to be anyone following  plus there was a large distraction with sir kerrions homestead being lit on fire the rain  taking care of most of 
none	 it but it drew people out of their homes to see this giant blazing symbol of  the de rolo family burning across the rooftop so a message was definitely left and probably  received by somebody and what are your plans  travis one down how many left how many are there left  marisha four four  taliesin four  travis there are five total whoa i did math  marisha there are six barrels one is empty  sam do you think the other two are the barrel names so two are sylas and delilah  taliesin 
none	 yes  sam and we know that one of the other two barrel names resides in that place that we found the  countess what was her name the doctor  taliesin doctor ripley  sam and whats the fourth name  taliesin professor anders  laura are we really going to talk about names right now and not about the giant creepy smoke  monster that came out of you percy  liam i think we need to find a place to lay low not here not where weve been somewhere else i  think we need to scope 
tavern	 out another place  laura i dont think its safe to leave tonight  sam i agree with vex that we cant leave tonight the streets are going to be crawling with guards  and people looking for us  marisha are we back in our hole where we were  matt youre back in the tavern where you guys were  laura it might be smart to be down in the cellar tonight not up  taliesin i agree  sam is there any sort of way you can close us in and make it look like its a 
none	 singlestory  dwelling  marisha yeah  liam yeah well go down to the tree and well make it look like no ones ever tunneled down  there before  marisha yeah i mean we can literally camp next to the roots of the tree if we want to i made it  look nice in there  laura okay  marisha i can clear out a bit more space  laura burt your mustache is falling off  sam it is  liam giggles you know the situation is very dire i dont know why im laughing its a 
tavern	  nervous habit im sorry  marisha speaking of nervous habits  sam one of us has a nervous habit of ejecting smoke from his rib cage  marisha i was also thinking about the weird cough that you have i dont think youre getting sick  whats going on oh and weve tunneled right were below the ground  matt you guys have made your way to the inn if you all wanted to go down and to the tree  marisha lets go down into the cellar im going to go ahead and throw up some walls  
none	 travis walls or the false ground  marisha i can do the false terrain  laura yeah do that  marisha ill do hallucinatory terrain and i will make it look like she said one story no cellar  matt okay  sam so the opening to the cellar will be just a dirt floor  marisha just wooden floor yeah  matt all right  marisha no ones here looks like it hasnt been touched  matt okay  taliesin those eyes make you look far more sarcastic than you normally do  matt do they  taliesin shouting 
none	 argh god  laughter  laura and he doesnt even smile at all  travis jeez youre the worst  liam so percival spill your guts what the fuck is going on  taliesin i dont entirely know where to begin  liam you didnt look surprised when that happened  marisha no in fact you pulled down your mask which you dont normally do in battles  taliesin it felt it didnt feel like a surprise i dont know it didnt feel good i was  hoping it would  laura you didnt seem to mind it as it 
none	 was happening  taliesin i think i wanted him to recognize me  marisha who  taliesin kerrion i dont know i was hoping it would feel better  marisha could you feel it happening while it was were you conscious do you remember what you did  liam what the fuck is it what is it percival what is it  taliesin a few years ago i had a dream i had a very intense dream and in this dream something  asked me if i wanted revenge if i wanted the means to have revenge and all i 
none	 would have to do  in return is offer up the souls of those i took  laura flatly oh thats all  sam wait what  taliesin it was a dream it was just a dream  sam and yet youve fashioned your entire lifes goal upon this dream  taliesin i woke up in the morning with an idea and i built that idea i thought it was prophetic  and lately ive been feeling a bit of strain and recalling it but it was just a dream  sam so the day after this dream was when 
none	 you first developed your pepperbox  taliesin its not the first time i felt inspired in my life i just it wasnt real  marisha and percy how long after the coup and after you lost your family was this dream  taliesin sighs maybe a year i was fuzzy at first i wasnt really me anymore i was a  fisherman for a while i didnt do anything this was something to do with myself this was  something to work towards  liam well were clearly not talking about a dream anymore we all saw it do you 
none	 have any  theories  taliesin i dont i dont know ive never thought about it it didnt matter  liam it matters now  taliesin i dont know what to do  laura who is the last bullet for  taliesin sighs  laura we dont want to lose you percy  taliesin when i started this i talked to a man at one point he was the captain of one of the  vessels i was on i told him what i intended to do and i showed him what i was building and he  said that 
none	 if i really wanted revenge if revenge was what i was after that there would be no  stopping it and there would be casualties along the way and i would have to give up things and i  would have to hurt people and that was the price so that last barrel is because its not just five  names i know im going to have to keep hurting people and that this thing existing is just going  to keep hurting people its the knowledge that it never ends its because i havent just killed  five people 
none	 ive killed a lot of people on my way here ive killed them with you and its to  remind me that this is what ive chosen  liam i dont understand weve killed with reason  taliesin and i have tried to and i certainly have reason for these five names they are not  good people these are not people who should be allowed to live  liam none of us debate that the briarwoods and their circle should be allowed to go on we all  understand what theyre capable of we all understand that they need 
none	 to be removed but what  we just saw goes beyond and youre telling us that this is going to continue after the  briarwoods and their like are gone what are we to look forward to percival where are we going  taliesin i was hoping that once id finished serving revenge that perhaps i could serve  repentance  marisha youre speaking of these as if theyre metaphysical beings youre serving revenge that  sounds very literal and from what ive seen isnt inaccurate  taliesin i no longer feel in control i no longer trust myself i 
none	 wouldnt expect you to trust me  liam stretching a little thin right now percy  taliesin but i trust you  sam can i just do a quick insight to see if hes being entirely honest  matt you may  sam well that didnt work much better 18  matt 18 go ahead and roll a dice percival  taliesin dice plus what  matt actually ill roll it for you whats your bonus  taliesin for which  matt for both persuasion and deception  taliesin persuasion and deception persuasion six deception two  matt okay he 
none	 seems very earnest very broken confused but driven and there isnt any part of  his voice that seems to conceal or attempt to hold back any information  travis are you afraid youre going to hurt us  taliesin no im afraid im going to disappoint you  marisha how would you disappoint us  taliesin i trust that you are all here in the service of justice and maybe friendship but im  not im here for revenge and as much as i would like to believe otherwise i know thats not true  and i think i 
none	 need people here who are not here for revenge i dont know how to stop this  marisha just because you started on this path for revenge doesnt mean you cant find other  motivations along the way do you believe youre not doing this with your friends or for your  friends not even a little bit its only a hundred percent revenge  taliesin no one does anything purely for one reason and i could justify it but id be lying  i want to hurt them i want them to know its me i want them to 
none	 feel remorse for what they have  done i want them to pay and if this thing is real if this is really what is happening now i  hope that wherever they go they suffer forever and beyond  travis i think that sounds fair  taliesin and im so grateful there is justice to be found in it but it is not justice that i am  motivated by and i couldnt pretend it would be i am so grateful there is justice in this but  even if there wasnt i would still be here  liam 
none	 i want to talk about a plan because our desires are in lockstep up to a point once we  have gotten rid of the last of them i want to know what happens then percival  taliesin ive never had to think of this before i think if we get out of this either im going to  need you to save me or finish me  laura no we wont do that  taliesin if it comes to it  laura damn it where is pike she would know about this  travis she would  marisha i 
none	 miss pike  taliesin well i do want to save this city  laura can we do any kind of religion check to see if we know anything about this kind of entity  matt yeah go ahead and make a religion check  travis three  matt suiting  marisha laughs suiting  laura 17  matt i mean there are all sorts of extraplanar entities throughout the realms that have their own  individual descriptions  marisha whenever he starts a description with i mean its not good  matt you dont have a whole lot of experience 
none	 outside of the realm of mortals youve had a few  interactions with things that skew beyond that realm while you get that hes saying it may just  be a dream you know that there are multitudes of creatures that thrive on these types of bargains  you do know that many of these bargains in the long run do not end up being wholly in the  persons favor who struck it  travis well look its going to help him on his quest get revenge and kill all the people that  killed his family right so 
dung	 can we do that and then if it gets out of control we bop him on  the head and take him to a temple  laura i think thats the best plan we have actually  travis i mean you were really awesome in that last fight  laura you did look pretty amazing im not going to lie  travis a little bit of pee came out it was that good  laura but i dont like how dark it went percy it went really dark  liam and heres the thing theres a thing there it is 
none	 right there heres the thing  taliesin oh god i hadnt even noticed so sorry  liam your chances of succeeding here alone are pretty fucking slim and if you want us  all to work with you you cant go from door to door bringing wrath and ruin the way you just  did or you wont have our assistance not all of us  sam now now vax what are you talking about we all knew what we were doing when we pay  attention to me im trying to be serious here dont you turn your eyes 
dung	 away from me look at me  when im talking to you we all knew what we were doing when we went into the house it was an  assassination mission i dont understand why everyones harping on how dark it got we knew  we were there to kill everyone in the whole place  liam this is a city oppressed these people did not invite it upon themselves  laura that guy deserved it but we did rip his tongue out which i think was a bit harsh  travis he said take his tongue  liam these 
none	 people dont want to exchange one warlord for another we need to maybe dial it back  a tick or two  sam no i disagree  travis i do too pedostache  sam we have to make a strong appearance this is shock and awe were not going to win over the  people by half measures and hey lets hold an election or something we have to kill everyone  in as dramatic a fashion as possible  laura this is beheading a pony all over again  liam you think were going to win them over by 
none	 showing them how disgusting we are  sam no how disgusting they are and how disgusting they die  liam no i mean the civilians here  laura were not going to kill civilians  liam of course but were trying to win them over and if were showing that were ripping out  their tongues and pulling their ears off and flaying their balls theyre going to be just as  scared of us as they are of the briarwoods  laura theyll probably be pretty happy that the people that have been hurting them are being  punished 
none	  marisha yes theyve been oppressed but weve also seen theres plenty of cases of people being  charmed by them we might have an army of people who will die for the briarwoods at any cost and  not even realizing theyre being charmed that way  sam i wouldnt mind a few people being scared of us too  taliesin i will say it did get out of hand and if i had known then what i know now i would hope  that you would restrain me in those moments where i seem to be going further 
dung	 than i should  laura done  travis are you saying for your final bullet you want us to stop you  laura no hes saying that if he goes dark if he goes against his person that we know  taliesin knock me out and take me to a temple  travis you dont want to scratch the name off the barrel  taliesin i didnt know it was going to disappear to be fair i thought that maybe i  could stop what was happening to me i panicked  marisha percy do you realize we tried to 
none	 talk to you for a good 15 minutes after all that last  night and you were unreachable do you remember that so us saying if you start getting out of  control and you think that were going to be able to be like yo percy calm it down a bit  laura were not going to do that were going to knock him the fuck out  taliesin yes  laura dont worry percy weve got you  sam i dont think i would knock him out  travis ill knock you out if you really want me 
none	 to  taliesin if i start to turn against you if you think for a moment that i am out of control  please please do what is necessary the moment that i turn on any of you the moment that i even  threaten any of you is a moment i am not in control no matter what is happening  travis yeah okay  laura i walk up and i kiss him on the cheek and i say dont you worry weve got you  taliesin especially with the cough thank you  laura i dont believe youre 
none	 really sick darling  sam vex ive heard a cough like that and its probably syphilis  laura lovely thank you scanlan  taliesin i barely sl i dont i  sam personal experience thats all im saying  travis shall we rest and then we go find another house  marisha well maybe we should now that we have the knockpercyoutincaseofemergency plan  should we have a revolution plan because we seem to be divided on that  taliesin theres still two more lords in the city and there is the castle they know were  here now  
none	 sam it might behoove us to spend a day or two finding another shelter and also seeing what our  actions have resulted in and seeing if we cant sway some opinion in our favor because were  strong but were also pretty weak these days and i wouldnt want to go against the big guns yet  until we have the people behind us or at least possibly turn one of those giants to our side or  something we need some help  laura we have a map of the city yes i think it best to stay 
none	 off the streets is it possible  keyleth to tunnel through the city underneath it  taliesin good idea  marisha i can actually yeah  sam cant really talk to people that way  laura no but they know were here its not safe we can come up in secret leave symbols to  rally the people and hide again  marisha you want to get a beat on the vibe of what people are saying out there  sam hey hep cat yes im wanting to get a beat on the vibe yes i think we need to 
none	 hear what  people are saying in the privacy of their homes maybe do some snooping  marisha well theres a few people in our party who are good at that  sam and we need to find another potential safehouse  marisha okay thats plan number one then i think its not a bad idea that we spread this de  rolo family crest around  taliesin have we been to the alcove yet  matt you went to the alcove no you have not been to the alcove  taliesin we havent been to the alcove or the 
none	 barracks yet the barracks are right against the  castle though  matt correct you went to the ladys chamber and you spoke briefly with keeper yennen  taliesin yeah with keeper yennen  travis yeah lets go to the barracks  matt and you went to beyond the horizon which was abandoned and partially collapsed  taliesin the barracks will be our last stop i believe just because its outside the city proper  and its up the hill we might be able to stay at the alcove which is a magic shop that used to be  in 
town	 town i know the proprietor or i did if hes still alive  travis yeah lets go there  marisha magic shop okay  taliesin it was a magic shop right  matt yeah its an arcane boutique yes  taliesin an arcane boutique  marisha are we tunneling there  laura are we going there now are we resting  sam we should rest  marisha its nighttime  matt right now i would say based on preparation the illusioncasting conversation  youre looking at about 900 930 in the evening  taliesin we could get an early start 
none	 once the light hits  sam if you fall asleep is that illusion going to vanish  marisha no i think hallucinatory terrain lasts for  laura can i sense anything near us can i sense vampires above us  matt so youre looking for undead  laura undead  matt okay you feel a surrounding presence scattered throughout the city some large some  small you can gather over a period of time of concentration you can feel the slow movement of  the zombie giants moving through the city the sentinels slowly tromping through and a number of 
none	  other undead entities there  laura does it feel like theres more in motion than there were before we set off the blaze  matt i would say yes there appears to be a little more haste and movement to what entities you  can and you cant pinpoint specifics but you do sense that there is a heightened state of  movement to what youve previously sensed  laura okay  liam yes ive a thought that at night obviously these streets are full of dead things tomorrow  the briarwoods and the people that work for them 
none	 are going to start pulling people out of their  houses and telling them to look for us or anyone whos not from this city so i dont think that  the beggar routine is going to work for much longer  laura thats why we stay under the city thats what i said  liam of course but if you want to talk to people i think we could probably get away with  poking about first thing in the morning and thats it  marisha okay  liam so we should probably get up early  laura all 
none	 right  sam and in addition to your excellent illusion spell  marisha which lasts for 24 hours  sam thats wonderful to hear is there any other means of protection we have i mean if they are  magic wielders they might be able to sense our presence or something is there any way to obscure  that i guess im asking this but im one of the only two magic wielders here so i should know the  answer  marisha i was going to say it would be probably a me and you thing in terms of 
none	 making us not as  noticeable seeming is probably going to be our closest thing i dont have anything  sam its just a visual though  laura nothing like a bubble of protection or anything  marisha ive got my antilife shell  laura but theyre undead lovely well first watch whos taking it  marisha we can all get a good nights sleep i think if i tunnel us in and weve got  hallucinatory terrain  laura i still think we should keep watch  travis percys got it yeah ill take second  taliesin all right 
none	  matt so youre all down at the bottom of the tunnel by the roots of the sun tree and you have  hallucinatory terrained the cellar  marisha yeah  laura i hate that hes asking for clarification  matt what  laura dont what me  matt whats the dc of your spell  marisha of hallucinatory terrain  matt of all your spellcasting whats the dc  marisha its 17 no 18 but i know they have to make an intelligence save to see through  hallucinatory terrain  matt correct if something were interested in doing 
none	 so  marisha exactly hypothetically  matt so whos taking first watch  travis percy  sam i will watch with him  marisha yeah percy cant watch alone  taliesin no thats fine  sam ill watch with him  liam i mean i raised my hand before but thats all right ill get some sleep  matt okay its tight quarters and you know other than either a magical light or torch someone  wants to put up there is no light source it is pitch black down here what are you guys using as  a light 
dung	 source or are you leaving it pitch dark  laura well you can light your little flaming warhammer  travis fine i take the flaming warhammer and i whisper the magic word bacon  and it turns on fire  laura im pretty sure he just said bagel  marisha bagel  matt all righty so you guys take first watch rest is till about 11pm or midnight or so you  guys finish whos taking second watch all right weve got grog and vax all right so you guys  liam while percival is sleeping i pull grog over 
none	 and we look at him for a while and i say where  do you think the smoke comes out of  travis oh thats a good question  liam do you think its the nostrils  travis no it looked like it was coming from the bottom up and theres only two holes down there  so its either  liam yeah thats right  travis either the dirt button  liam it could just be his pores youre right its probably  travis its probably the periscope youre right  matt as you guys are having this conversation 
dung	 the air down here its damp earth its chilled  in the night anyway but its a little warmer because youre under the ground and its absorbed  some of the heat of the day but it is getting noticeably colder  marisha its getting colder  matt yeah just as the evening progresses the temperature at night here  sam colder than it did last night because it also got pretty cold last night  matt comparable yeah theres a low mist begins to form within the tunnel from the temperature  liam i wake up my sister  
none	 laura what what do you want  liam theres fog or something whats going on  travis its just cold  laura can we see if its magic  matt make an insight check  liam do that thing again you can tell when stuffs around  laura oh good i rolled a one  travis can i do a nature check to show them its just fucking fog  matt yeah go ahead and roll  travis a 13  matt okay you step forward and take a good long look at the fog that is slowly beginning to 
none	 form  at the base of the tunnel you guys are in as you lean forward and take it in the fog begins to  form into a physical humanoid essence and reach out for you for the three that are conscious  roll initiative  sam oh god  laura shit its a teeny tiny tunnel  marisha its another damn ghost wraith thing ghosting in  matt all right  sam so what if the sun tree is like  laura the source of the bad  sam yeah  laura its possible it is  marisha thats 
none	 kind of funny  laughter  laura what if the briarwoods are right under the sun tree and were right above them  travis what if they didnt hang the bodies the tree just grabbed people  matt so grog back in the fog vex is waking up the back trinket asleep next to her percy  scanlan  taliesin actually can you move the wyrmwood box because all im  liam yes wyrmwood gaming check them out beautiful boxes  matt indeed all right this will go there for now  laura you look really good matt  matt 
none	 i cant move in this great all right so get some initiatives on this for grog  travis 17  matt 17 all righty okay laura  laura oh 22  matt 22 all right and  liam 18  matt 18 good to know  sam are we spooning  taliesin were sporking  sam oh we are  marisha you guys might be sporking  matt so vex grog then you rolled a what  liam 18  matt oh sorry vax vex you rolled a  laura 22  matt 22 right grog you were a  
none	 travis 17  matt 17 okay so grog this is technically a surprise round on you then well get back to you  guys on top of the initiative you can see now the mist has formed into a pale humanoid with two  more now that have rolled in these palelooking intensely feral human beings with elongated fangs  emerge from this mist and immediately lunge out towards you  laura are they vampires  marisha can they do that  laura they can theyre fucking vampires  sam no they can only become bats i read about this 
none	  liam sings lets do this  matt so first and foremost the one that lunges out at grog is going to shift to the side there  is going to make a claw attack against you that is a 20 to hit  travis that hits  matt that hits all right you take eight points of slashing damage or no you do not actually  instead it is going to attempt to grapple you not attempt it grapples you so it reaches out  and grasps on to some of the hide armor you have tied around your 
none	 shoulder pulls you in and is  going to attempt to sink its teeth into your actual body  laura dont forget that we all have our amazing metal around our neck that scanlan got us  matt thats true  laughter  liam youre so intimidating in that costume  matt good that is a 17 versus armor class  travis that misses  matt okay so it attempts to bite into you you move out of the way just in time and that little  bit of chain mail that practically useless piece of chainmail wrapped around your 
none	 giant thick neck  does manage to catch its fangs and deflect the attack initially  liam and laura hey  sam what that piece of metal thing hey i made that i call it a scanlan i call everything a  scanlan  matt this one is going to swoop in as you are now currently grappled by the other one its going to  attempt to grab you on the other side that is a 21 to hit so its going to grapple you and this  one is also going to now reach up with its claws 
none	 to pull down the chain mail grasps you there  since its a surprise round natural 20 all right so you take five points of piercing damage and  sam and youre a vampire  matt and 11 points of necrotic and your maximum hit points are reduced by 11  travis okay really  laura oh no we havent had another feast yet  sam oh and the feast is gone too isnt it  marisha yeah  matt so this third one over here is going to attempt to come after you vax closest to  it that 
none	 is a 24 to hit  liam well that hits but im going to use uncanny dodge  matt okay to reduce the damage  liam yeah by half  matt thats 2d4 slashing against you ten points of slashing damage  liam is the half  matt yes its going to try to claw you again thats a 12  liam nope  matt yeah so the first one slashes across the side of your shoulder but you manage to pull out  of the way just in time to lessen the impact this however sets you up for 
none	 the easily dodged  second blow you swoop out of the way just barely in time feeling the wind whoosh above your  head that ends their turn now were at the top of the initiative order surprise round this  would not have been enough noise to wake you guys yet so youre going to hold on until somebody can  get your attention top of the round will be vex  laura im going to say wake the fuck up and i am going to can i hide is that what i do as my  bonus  
dung	 matt you have nowhere to hide in this room unfortunately  laura even if its superduper dark  matt you get the idea that these creatures probably arent largely affected by the dark  laura that makes perfect sense im going to hunters mark the one that looks the strongest  matt okay the one thats most visible to you would probably be this one going after your brother  you mark that one  laura i am now going to attack him with my blazing bow  matt all righty go for it  laura all right natural 20 
none	  travis nice wyrmwood box  taliesin breaking in the new box  laura thats right  liam sings its my dice in a box  marisha and taliesin dice in a box yeah  laura i add all of my dice together and then i double it and then i add the modifier okay and  i hunters marked him yeah  matt yes you did  laura 31  matt 31 definitely hits  laura thats 31 damage  matt oh 31 damage laughs okay all righty  laura the second one was a three it was a 
dung	 14 to hit  matt no unfortunately it dodges out of the way its reflexes are very quick  liam be honest the karma will come back to you  matt right so as you pull back you release and with a flash of burning energy your arrow ignites  midtransit it blasts and bursts into the vampiric creature who hisses at you snarls through  the dark the second arrow however its completely ready for and actually manages to swipe it out of  the air with its clawed hand okay that ends your turn next up is vax 
none	  liam all right there is one vampire right in front of me right the one who hurt me  matt correct  liam but im looking past his head at the one next to grog the one thats got a blade down  there on the map no the other one yeah i think ive got a pretty good shot at him im going to  ignore the vampire in front of me and since grog is right up against that guy im going to sneak  attack him and go daggers flying oh no first im going to 
none	 go click with my heels and then im  going to daggers flying  marisha click click dagger dagger dagger  matt dagger dagger dagger what you got  liam its all right its a 19 the second is a 28 and the third is a 21  matt yep  liam all three hit  matt yeah the first one was  liam i dont remember  taliesin 18  matt 18 yeah they all hit not a problem  liam okay so the first one is the sneak attack and that one gets oh i should be using 
none	 the  wyrmwood box eight plus 12 15 18 25 25 for the first one and for the second dagger that  sinks into his head that is eight and for the third one that sinks into his fanged fucking face  that is nine  matt all righty cool so you click your boots of haste you feel the influx of adrenaline hit your  body the magical push you take the daggers and daggers flying the vampire in front of you tries  to swipe out of your hands but youre too fast youve already released all three 
none	 before he even  gets to your wrist and pull back grinning at it all three daggers dagger impacts repeatedly  hitting nearly the same point like an amazing throwing of darts just smack smack smack into  the center of the chest of the vampire across the way its distracted by grog it doesnt  see them coming until it is too late and it screeches out in pain screeching towards you  the eyes help on this huh a nice and sizable chunk of damage all righty that ends your turn  unless you want to try to 
none	 move  liam yeah actually im going to no nope im good  matt all right grog youre up  travis i would like to rage  laughter  matt please do  travis and i would like to take my firebrand warhammer and pound that shit to the left of me  twice in the head with my fiery hammer  matt all righty go for it  travis oh yeah that is a 15  matt 15 just barely hits  travis and thats a one  liam its so hard to roleplay tonight  travis its so 
none	 difficult  marisha im jimmy falloning so hard over here  matt yeah you are chuckles  travis 16  matt 16 on the first one all right that guy on the left the one that just got three daggers to  its chest as the dagger vanishes from its wound it looks over at you at your already big grin  midswing wham the warhammer blasts into its chest a burst of fire wreathing around its torso  for a second it gets pushed up against the wall this time you go to swing with all your might on 
none	  your second blow trying to smash it up against the earth that you guys have carved this tunnel  out of it ducks out of the way in splitsecond timing and your hammer gets wedged into the  side of the wall go ahead and make an athletics check  liam pull that shit out  travis shit nine  matt nine its pretty well wedged in there right now  liam next weapon  matt all right so now this ones going to shift over this way towards you percy  as youre on the ground prone still 
none	 just coming to consciousness he just snarls and lunges out  towards you this ones going to move here placing in that position this ones going to stay  there all right so the one rolling against you grog it still has you no the one that had you  grappled walked away towards percy the other ones going to attempt to grapple you  that was 18  travis misses  matt misses you slap aside with your hand as you still try to pull the warhammer out of the wall  and then it gets clotheslined by the 
none	 grip you have on it its going to try to strike you with its  claws for the second attack thats a ten yeah no  travis misses  matt you swish out of its way laughing in its face the one against you percy where youre on  the ground prone oh okay thatll be an 18  taliesin im an 18  matt it grabs you by the front of your shit and lifts you up with that hissing sound yeah  thatll be a 25 it pulls you in and sinks its fangs into the side of 
none	 your throat you can feel  yourself gasp out in pain as the cold sensation pulses through your body the actual lifes blood  being drained from you okay you take four points of piercing damage and you take eight points of  necrotic damage and your maximum hit points are reduced by eight  travis i forgot i have advantage on strength checks when im raging  matt roll again  travis a one  laura wow really  taliesin its as if the gods defy you  matt so youre now grappled and held there its pulling the 
none	 blood out of your throat youre  caught off guard and completely just confused frightened and in serious pain at this moment  all right and the one thats hunters marked thats against you its going to attempt to grab  you thats a 20  liam yeah that works  matt okay no damage its just going to grab you and it goes in to attempt to go through  your throat you being prepared for this having been subjected to this once before you bring a  dagger up towards its face and it just barely manages to 
none	 pull out of the way before you thrust  it up through the bottom of its neck you manage to deflect the attack all right the people who just  woke up roll initiative please  sam initiative  matt which for the record scanlan as a fan mentioned to me this last week your  jackofalltrades ability as a bard that gives you plus two to all things youre not proficient  in also adds to your initiative technically so you have a plus two to your initiative ive had  this brought up multiple times if its not 
none	 true  sam i know its been brought up to me i thought it was a hypothetical is it true  matt its been clarified by a couple of publications that have been sent to me when i  questioned it  liam what is the bonus for that hat  matt well consider that hat the plus two bonus  sam chuckles so i get a plus two i rolled a 20 initiative then  matt oh snap scanlan next to vax nice  marisha 12  matt 12 all right percy  taliesin 22  matt wow  
none	 taliesin i have really good initiative  matt all right so we are now at the top of the round this puts us to vex and percy going  simultaneously  taliesin ill go first im going to try and break grapple obviously since thats what i have  to do  laura can i aid him by shooting him at the same time as he is trying to break the grapple  matt you know what yes go ahead and roll your first attack  liam go for the ear its a one  travis you have the sage 
none	 still  taliesin its still at home  laura its been a lot of ones today man  marisha its only our first hour  matt yeah all right so unfortunately the first arrow there is too much movement to the bodies  it doesnt strike true so you do not have advantage on this check acrobatics or athletics  your choice  taliesin acrobatics  matt all righty  liam lets be clear that was the shitty plastic die not the wyrmwood box  taliesin 28  matt 28 you manage to break the grapple  taliesin so thats 
none	 my action but if i now spend an action surge i can get an action  matt you can yes  taliesin do i get three attacks with the sword i just picked up since im too close to use my gun  right now  matt technically yeah  taliesin im going to draw the rapier that i just picked and start stabbing at the terrible thing  all the while screaming screams  matt all right go for it  laughter  laura is your little butt flap down are you in the long johns  taliesin the 
none	 butt flap of my soul is down im welldressed at the moment  matt its a plusone rapier but your archery you took i think was your combat  taliesin yes so i get a negative two to attack  matt correct to what you normally get so you have a overall plus one  taliesin so i get a plus one to attack on top of my  matt no sorry minus one is the total from what you get for your pistols for your pepperbox  taliesin minus one not minus two got it  matt the magical 
none	 rapier offsets that a bit  taliesin thats 25  matt 25 hits  taliesin thats a one misses  matt go ahead and roll a third time  taliesin and thats a 14  matt okay so the first strike sinks true thats 1d8 plus whats your strength modifier well no  it would be dex  taliesin dex thank you so thats 1d8 plus dex  matt plus one damage on top of that because its a plusone weapon  taliesin thats a nine  matt nine damage all right so your first swing the speed of your 
none	 ability to break this grapple  and then immediately pull this weapon and jam it forward it pierces part of the body and pull out  the creature all of a sudden reaches over and grabs its side instinctually you go for two more  strikes however being the first time in a long time that youve ever held a rapier and still with  your other hand holding your throat in severe pain it flings forward twice the second  time the creature actually grabs it and pulls you in towards it  taliesin yells  marisha what  
none	 matt so yeah youre now considered regrappled  taliesin yells  matt so you can take another attack  laura ill do my second arrow and try to hit him again because i dont like that i missed  travis fucking hit him this time will you  laura i know right dont suck so hard me  liam come on dont do that again youre my sister  laura thats better that definitely hits it was an 18 plus  matt oh 18 plus stuff yeah go ahead and roll damage this is against the one thats on percy 
none	  still or the one thats against your brother  laura i said it was the one against percy even though the other one is hunters marked  taliesin dont sound so upset about it  laura well im just saying  matt too late  laura yes 16  matt 16 all right this arrow however does manage to sink into its side it protrudes about  four inches from its body its pretty deep into its torso breaking a couple of ribs but you see  the creature being the undead nature of its physicality its not looking 
none	 too great but its not at the end of  its rope right now all right that ends that scanlan youre up  sam okay so theres three of these things  matt there are three of them yes  sam okay im going to use my movement can i see them all  matt you can currently yes  sam ill use my movement because i just woke up to pee because i just woke up ive got to pee  travis do you have morning  sam its midnight wood  travis okay so its probably going to 
none	 go everywhere  liam youre acting like youre botoxed  sam i cant move my lips  matt so scanlan you use your movement to pee  sam while im peeing i whip out my wand of magic missiles and i point it and i use four of the  slots for it to shoot four times three is 12 missiles  matt can you do that  sam each slot is one magic missile spell which is three missiles  matt i dont know if you can use multiple slots on a turn can you  sam it says 
none	 so on the wand for one charge you cast the 1stlevel spell you can increase the  spell slot level for each additional charge you spend so im going to use four of them  travis like a battleship  marisha like a level4 magic missile  sam which is 4d4 plus four for each one that i hit  taliesin like a rhinestone cowboy  liam its the mustache  travis taliesin and marisha sing rhinestone cowboy  laura burt reynolds should play with us more often  travis he has the best old man laugh right now  
none	 sam this guy is the brains of the operation  liam let me break the fourth wall just for a second to say that this game is totally fucked  matt it creates an additional dart per spell level so its initially three and its three  levels higher it gets to six  sam oh so it doesnt increase it three darts per level its one so if i do a level four i get  two darts for each fucker  matt essentially yeah id be 6d4 plus six  sam 6d4 plus six okay so 2d4 plus 
none	 two for each guy ill do that  matt and they hit automatically there is no roll for it  sam great and it cant hit my friends or anything right i mean theyre magic missiles  matt no they unerringly hit theyre like homing arcane projectiles  sam do i have to roll this six times or just two  matt six times i know  sam so three plus two for the first guy  matt okay so five against him  sam ten for the second guy  matt all righty  sam and seven for the 
none	 third guy  matt all righty so as you get up  sam by the way im holding my dick with one hand and the wand with the other im dual wielding  marisha dual wielding are you proficient in that  matt i think scanlan is pretty proficient in this im just saying all right so  sam and theyre both spraying everywhere  matt happy halloween  travis are you writing your name with your left hand  matt okay so as you sign your signature on the ground you also burst forth with a series of  
none	 arcane bolts that streak across the room slamming into the sides of each of these vampires they all  look towards you as a reaction to the pain and their heads all turn curiously as to what they  see not what they were expecting  sam dont worry i wont wash my hands  laughter  matt all right thats your movement and your action i think thats your turn right  sam do i get a bonus  matt if you want to use one yeah  sam sure so ill inspire grog sings i need grog to

none	 at the fact that youve  currently been unable to really prove your might as a goliath in front of these individuals you  grin as you pull it back and wham slam it directly in the face of it it rears back  growls confused for a second you can see a crack in its jaw and blood beginning to trickle down  its jaw you pull back and slam it a second time this time with a resounding crack sound as part  of its jaw is dislodged and set to the side its tongue dangling out and 
dung	 dark black blood begins  to pour from the center of its mouth as it looks to you with absolute fear that was pretty rough  travis yeah  matt all righty you want to do anything with your movement  travis nope  matt all right  travis actually ill put my back against the wall  matt this one  travis yes to open it up in case somebody wants to take a shot at him  matt okay it will get an attack of opportunity on you are you cool with that  travis yes  matt

none	 trying to stop and slap the hands  away but youre too fast and the final hit you push it up and youre right in its face again  you can see its fangs still wet with the blood that it pulled from your throat and you grin at  it back as you withdraw the dagger with much force and anger  liam and the last thing i say is vampires aint shit  laughter  matt getting that on a jacket now vampires aint shit all right cool that ends your turn unless  you want to move 
none	 or do anything else  liam nah  matt all right now its their turn you notice by the way this round specifically as theyre  looking a little more wounded their flesh begins to slowly reform the wounds theyve taken begin  to seal up and the pouring of blood begins to slowly turn into a trickle  liam so what so does scanlans mustache  matt its true  sam i would smile right now if i could  laughter  taliesin i want to tickle you see what happens  matt all righty this ones going to

none	 19 hits  matt 19 hits no damage but now its grabbed you and shoved you up against the wall it takes one  hand and jams it up under your chin to push your head up and goes for your throat rolls a one as  it goes to bite your throat you pull pepperbox up and jam it into its mouth it choking it has to  pull back from the attack and you can see now this vampire saliva is all over the barrel of the  gun and it may have chipped a tooth all right 
none	 that finishes their turn keyleth youre up  marisha whoa  sam not a dream  marisha okay i thought it was for a second  liam real vampires  marisha okay whats the situation with the vampires thats all of them clustered there  matt theres two of them right there on percy they have him grabbed and shoved against the wall  theres one over here thats battling back and forth with vax  marisha vax where is percy  taliesin against the wall  marisha youre against the wall i get up can i reach around scanlan

none	 want to do  matt okay so you slide alongside scanlan  marisha and i yell to the party shield your eyes  sam i instinctively cover my penis  laughter  liam oh my goodness  sam its more important than my eyes  travis take my eyes not my penis  liam its the third one  matt yeah no you were technically in melee with this guy but there is no attack roll so you  dont have disadvantage which is good  marisha awesome  matt all right so  marisha i roll a bunch of 
none	 d6s  matt well yeah go ahead and do that each creature has to make a constitution saving throw  marisha how many d6s do i roll  matt its 6d8 radiant damage and they have disadvantage on the saving throw because they are  undead so the first one that is a 14 nope second one no third one no rolled a one all  right so all of them take full damage  marisha full damage okay so that is 15 19 not bad 21 plus 12 so thats 33 radiant damage and  they are blinded  
none	 sam what is that true  matt okay well chuckles  sam singing let the sun shine let the sunshine in  matt so both of these vampires currently have percy pinned up against the wall one of them is  trying to bite his throat and percys trying to keep it at bay with his weapons keyleth you step  forward  marisha where i can also not look at scanlans penis  matt right you feel the inspiration based on the presence of the sun tree and what previously  you were attempting to try and repair it 
none	 with using that you close your eyes and a burst of  sunlight energy cascades forth slamming into both the vampires and barely missing percy in the  process both of them look over out of the corner of their eye as they see the flash of light they  both scream out screeches as the blast shoots through both of them both of them immediately  turn to ash and are strewn against the far wall  travis whoa damn  sam that was so cool  marisha that was cool  sam zip  travis bonus action  
none	 marisha so there is one alive  matt there is one alive yes thats right next to you  marisha and hes on vax  matt currently yes  marisha okay i see that i turn and i see him and im gonna take a grasping vine and wrap around it and  yank him trying to beat him up against the wall on the other side  matt this side here  marisha yep  matt okay is it a bonus action for grasping vine  marisha yes it is  matt whats the roll for that im looking 
none	 for the roll for grasping vine real fast  marisha i conjure a vine i think it just happens  matt dexterity saving throw with the dc its 17  marisha nope 18  matt 18 no that gets it  matt damn all right so it pulls it impact sound into the wall over that way the vines now  currently wrapped around its torso it tries to pull itself free  laura we should probably use sunlight on them always because dont they turn into mist if we  dont kill them  marisha yeah i think so 
none	  matt all right that brings us to the top of the round vex and percy its your go  laura i dont know should we attack him or should we let  travis stake  laura oh yeah i bust out one of the wooden daggers i walk up and i try to stab it into his  heart in front of my brother  marisha nice wood dagger  matt all right go ahead and roll for a melee attack  laura okay i still get two attacks right  matt correct and youre using your dexterity as 
none	 the bonus simple weapon  which youre proficient with  laura 19  matt that is a 19 does hit yes  laura okay then what do i do  matt roll for second attack  laura probably no 14  matt 14 does not hit all right so go ahead and roll 1d4 add your dex modifier  laura nine  matt all right so you take the heavilysharpened wooden dagger essentially you jam it into its  chest it screeches out in pain the wooden stake itself partially destroyed in the process of  jamming it in to 
none	 do so much damage it reaches up grabs it and breaks it off and part of it still  in its chest goes growling hiss hisses at you angrily  laura wooden stakes dont work i back up a little bit  sam you got some damage in no yes  that stake was well done yeah  laughter  travis that was so csi miami man  liam your mustache is almost down to your chin for a goatee  sam soon it will be creeping across my face  matt all right that ends your turn  laura

none	 not entirely certain you know that sunlight is very damaging to it and from your  research you know that vampires of certain levels of power as opposed to dying turn into a mist  form and attempt to retreat  marisha they misted in  taliesin im going to hack at his neck with my sword a couple of times  marisha i wrote all that stuff down  taliesin 28  matt 28 hits  taliesin 22  matt hits  taliesin 22  matt all right all three hit  taliesin ten points 15 points  matt

town	 sam thenardier is our precious father  matt the four of you head off towards the alcove heading out into the day the cloud cover is  pretty thick there is just general moisture and mist to the air it probably could rain any  second you continue moving towards the northwestern side of the town you do notice in  comparison to previous days there is a little more energy to the streets people seem to be  moving back and forth with hustle and business you do also see as you head on your way out  there 
dung	 is still a slight bit of smoke slowly swimming up from the house in the distance and  what minor embers were not put out by the rainfall its just a little trace of smoke  taliesin was it the north the east or the west manor  matt that was the eastern  taliesin eastern manor  matt yeah that one is partially burned down so as you continue heading northwest you eventually  make your way to where you recall the alcove was now when you get there its a relatively  plainlooking building dark woods theres a 
none	 sign out front that says the alcove its old the  metal that holds the sign has rusted a bit the doors are open and as you push into the building  its largely empty and seemingly unkempt compared to the previous oddity shops youve been to many  books about enchantment look left out on one of the nearby tables partially read and abandoned as  if they were being flipped through and then as you look across the room behind the counter  theres a young girl in her late teens a blonde waif of a girl whos 
none	 currently thumbing through a  book and notices you guys enter oh hi can i help you  taliesin yes were looking to buy a few things and we were wondering actually i used to do  business with simon is simon around  matt simon was called away for a special project by the briarwoods about six months ago he told me  to look over the store while hes gone im sorry were mostly out of stock we dont have much here  at the moment  taliesin he was called away on a special project what sort

none	 in public  travis can somebody see if theres something watching  marisha yeah can i do a perception check around the room and see if theres any indications that  the briarwoods might have  travis monitoring  marisha yeah a bug like some sort of something where they might be monitoring this place  sam a small electronic device  marisha yes that kind of bug  matt make a perception check  marisha not bad 26  matt looking around the room there doesnt appear to be any specific devices installed whether  magical or otherwise that

town	 the last ones  sam the last ones  matt the uprising three years ago are you new to this fucking town  sam three years ago papa wouldnt let me out of the closet so i didnt hear much of what was  going on  matt okay first and foremost youve got to treat your boy better going to raise someone no  better than the motherfuckers running whitestone right now if you keep this up  liam retches  laura did you really puke or did you fake puke  sam im sorry about my papa hes 
town	 had such a hard time these last few years our crops are not  performing well and hes under a lot of pressure and i think mama doesnt love him anymore im  sorry we can go  matt i think you should but one thing if he ever does anything else to hurt you again you  come tell someone two if you hear anything else about this savior coming into town go ahead and  talk to trevor over there at the edge of the bar and you see over there theres the guy  whos behind the 
tavern	 bar with his book he doesnt even notice all this happening guy in his  midthirties glasses at the end of his nose his hairs slicked back and pulled into a taut  ponytail and hes sitting there reading and he says go ahead and tell trevor because the rest  of us would like to go out in a blaze of glory than live in this bullshit  sam what was your name sir  matt not important to much but you can call me patrick  sam thank you patrick i dont know if my papa has enough 
none	 money for these drinks  liam im going to insight check patrick  sam from the floor  matt hes listening in go for it  liam all right thats not that great thats a 17  matt he seems honest seems hes got not much to lose and his interest is piqued but hes not  wholly invested in this whole idea but its definitely caught his attention well lets get  him up stands up reaches over and grabs you by the arm lifts you up onto the stool on the side  of the table and says 
none	 up you pats you on the back you need to sober up drink the water you  got for your boy there and get your ass out of here  sam come on papa lets go i turn around and i take the rest of his drink  laughter  liam and as he pulls me away and i slovenly turn after him i turn back for a second and i  completely sober up pelor has returned  walked out  matt he gives you a keen glance and nods slowly as you walk away looks over at the 
none	 bartender for  a second and psst trevor and then you exit the building all right you guys all convene at  the ladys chamber the other day there were a few folks walking through the courtyard today  theres a group of about 25 people all different dress from what would be considered a whitestone  middle class the few there are to a number of other peasantry farmhands and other folk that  look destitute by nature of existence here all gathered in the amphitheater and what appears to  be a relatively hushed sermon or discussion currently 
none	 going on by keeper yennen  marisha lets not make ourselves known i want to see this i want to hear whats up  taliesin sit in the back  matt okay sit in the back he begins talking for a while about a long tangent speaking of this  land once cherished is a burning light and a beacon of good existence of kinship of honesty  and loyalty dragged down to the muck by the imposition of darkness the return of the evil  that once scourged this land now given new faces they push us down and 
none	 as hope crumbles the light  peeks through once again for whispers have come to my ears friends that this unrest now has a  name im sure youve seen it the fire atop that building this morning watched as one of your  oppressors was cut from his high throne one of his close advisors scarred tortured shown the  strength of this hidden ally of us the oppressed peoples of whitestone and he looks up over the  group a little bit and past the streets carefully i have come to believe that perhaps this is the  
none	 time for us to band together and show our support now the information is still vague but just keep  your eyes open be careful be quiet as things progress word will find you bows his head and  says a prayer that none of you speak celestial  taliesin i do  sam you do  taliesin i speak celestial  matt all righty the essence of the prayer is by the guidance of the lady may civilization  flourish and those that keep progression at bay be squashed beneath our feet at which point the  sermon breaks 
none	 and people begin to walk away and scatter  laura i want to watch people as they walk away and try to read their lips as theyre walking away  to see if everybody seems loyal to what he said or if anybody seems a little  matt everyone is silent everyone is quiet and everyone is looking warily and making their own  separate paced exits so as not to draw attention  laura can we try to memorize their faces of everybody that was here  matt okay you keep as best a mental image of everyone whos 
none	 passing by not too many notable  folk they look like especially where youre from the peasantry doesnt really interest you  visually but you do manage to gather details of certain scars here and there and people hair  color age stuff like that  travis did we recognize the guy that was talking  laura yeah that was keeper  matt keeper yennen  marisha yeah any familiar faces in the audience  matt actually scanlan you and keyleth both recognize some of the farmers you guys have all  gathered  sam oh we gathered again okay 
none	  matt you recognize two of the individuals at this were the farmers you initially saw on the  outskirts of whitestone when you did your little scouting mission earlier  sam oh nice when we flew in  matt yeah  sam okay  matt so from all the people youve encountered those are the only two that you specifically  recognize so far but it does appear to be made up of  marisha working hands farmers  matt yeah the foundation of this city that have been so long oppressed  travis i elbow percy and i 
none	 go do we talk to him  taliesin i think we do maybe he talks to us i try and catch his attention  matt okay you can see as he begins putting out some of the incense he looks over and sees ah  yes youve returned please follow me and he steps outside of the amphitheater and around the  back of it  taliesin we follow  matt okay around the back of the amphitheater you see there is constructed attached to the very  far end of this round halfdome a square brick building very simple 
none	 and as he ushers you all  inside its essentially a tea room theres a table theres a tea set up there there is a  small stove in the far end with a little fireburning stove and shelves and shelves and  shelves arranged with all different manner of small sculptures metalwork holy symbols of  erathis that have all been put on display each one has a name carved beneath it and you  recognize this percy this is the legacy of all the keepers of the ladys chamber over time their  symbols this is basically a 
town	 hall of previous keepers please sit have tea if you like if  youre so interested we have much to discuss so i am to believe that these allies you spoke of  previously were responsible for this dastardly attack on sir kerrion  taliesin that could be inferred  matt well i have spoken privately with a number of the remaining community leaders of our town  and they are unconvinced understand this isnt the first time an insurrection has been attempted  and much sorrow was endured after previous failures we keep hope best we can but without 
none	 a  solid plan we are sending the rest of our ablebodied into the abyss  taliesin what happened last time  matt well in a similar fashion we had a number of fedup individuals decide to finally raise some  sort of aggressive act against the castle and attempt to storm it by force we figured we had  the numbers there are many dangers in that castle that go beyond what we were prepared for as such  the few that survived well they met the fate most do at the sun tree these days so weve been 
none	  remiss to put ourselves in a similar position for many years now to make matters worse our  informant within the castle has gone silent these past few weeks we have no idea of the progression  of the briarwoods plot  marisha was your informant by chance named simon  matt no simon has been missing for some time actually  taliesin who was your informant  matt i dont know the name the information comes through actually he should be arriving  here in just a moment  taliesin what did they find underneath whitestone  matt 
none	 all that we know is theyve been rebuilding or repurposing something old and terrible beneath  the city ive only heard whispers of it referred to as the ziggurat  laura travis and marisha the ziggurat  matt now to go into the deep history of this city as you are outsiders legend speaks of a  seed that the sun tree was placed by pelor himself to seal a wound in the light whitestone  rose around it the fable has long been told but ever since those fiends took the city their  interest beneath the city has 
dung	 kept me thinking on this fable leaves me very unsettled and as the  sun tree slowly died so did our confidence further  at which point the door across the room opens creak and another enters the room a very  elderly man steps in his ragged robes draped on his very thin frail form  laura i wink at him  matt his weathered skin is dark and leathery hes nearly hairless on his head and has liver  spots all over his scalp one of his eyes is clouded over and white he shimmies in very  
none	 slowly i ask you strangers what makes you so sure you can change the tide of this battle  travis whispers drop seeming drop it  taliesin do i recognize this person  matt as old as he may be there is a subtle power and resonance and confidence to his voice theres  a force of personality and conviction that immediately leads you to believe that this man is  or once was a man of great power and respect  travis are there windows in the room  matt there are two windows they are currently shut with 
none	 curtains  travis you should show him  matt you percy recognize this man he was once the chancellor to your father and a  longrespected philosopher in whitestone known as archibald desnae  marisha archibald desnitt  matt desnae he was very wellrespected very stern and crotchety at times but very much aided  your family in holding the city together in times of strife  sam i pull out sir kerrions notebook and i hand it to them and i say this should be some proof  that we mean what we say  matt reaches out and 
none	 his long spindly fingers wrap around the tome pull it towards him so you  bring a trinket that is helpful but to kill one mortal man is no feat compared to the darkness  that lies in that castle you need more than that  taliesin i remove my hat  sam can i drop it on one of us or do i have to drop it on all of us  matt id say you can drop it on an individual if you prefer  sam all right i will drop percys seeming  matt okay theres a 
none	 slamming sound as the tome hes holding hits the floor  taliesin hello archie  matt percival sweet percival  taliesin not so sweet these days i did not think you would have lived  matt i thought you had perished in the subjugation percival you have no idea the joy  this brings to my heart and he reaches out and touches the edge of your face like hes still in  disbelief your hair it seems age has caught up to you as well  taliesin it was difficult leaving  matt you see a smile creep across 
none	 his very tense oldman face and he looks about the room with a  renewed energy that wasnt there before  taliesin my friends are strong  matt with you here percival weve two de rolos spearheading the rebellion we have the guiding  light the people need  taliesin who else survived  matt we must succeed percival if this fails there wont be anyone else left to rise up they  are nearing their goal according to your sister cassandra we havent much time  your sister lives percival  marisha oh shit  matt she survived the 
dung	 attack and was taken as the personal assistant and slave of the briarwoods  and used as an example a symbol of their dominance she has been feeding us information for  years whenever she could she was the helping guide the last two attempts weve made we have  not received a letter from her in weeks now but know you are not the only surviving member of your  family i will talk to your people i will talk to mine well have your militia guide us percival  fredrickstein von mussel klossowski de rolo iii guide us 
none	 vox machina  sam wait you know who we are how does he know  matt some of us have information all over these lands weve had a few friends come from emon over  the past couple years they met some dire ends dont think that we havent heard of your  exploits help us bring a dawn back to this land  taliesin i may have a plan how fares professor anders  matt professor anders has been lost to us since before the insurrection he is a man taken by what  promises the briarwoods have given 
town	 him what little he has shown his face in this town he is  not the man he once was or at least the man we thought he was was never  who he truly claimed to be  taliesin he lives in the house in the east house in the north  matt he lives in the castle with the briarwoods as well  taliesin lady ripley lives in one of those mansions  matt she did there have been reports in recent days that shes been quick to pack we know not  where she resides now  
none	 taliesin who lives in the third house  matt here and he takes a moment to think of which house youre referring to  taliesin we burned one of them  matt yes you did the house is kerrions house and then there are two other homesteads of the new  nobles one of which is currently held by the duke he says with disdain goran vedmeyer  marisha goran quagmire  laura and sam vedmeyer  matt vedmeyer he has supposedly been put in watch at the temple of pelor but hes left that  to ruin the other 
none	 home houses count tylieri a rather sadistic man who oversees the timber  production of whitestone  laura the what production  matt timber  sam is that the house that the countess was briefly residing in  matt briefly  sam count tygieri  matt tylieri  sam tylieri how are these men the duke and the count what do the people think of them  matt the briarwoods when they took whitestone did not take it alone they came to this land with  a small army of cutthroats mercenaries sellswords they brought over from whichever  forsaken 
none	 land they came from each one of those men that then proved to be of utmost use to them  in that rebellion they were given titles and nobility and homesteads they were given  responsibilities over the land the people beneath them i can only assume that was part of their  payment for their service  sam but theyre just thugs who were particularly successful  matt as far as i know yes  laura are they supernatural are they undead  matt not to my knowledge  travis if we were to continue working our way up 
none	 this totem pole which of the two is less  powerful  taliesin which of the two is reviled most  marisha yes what would start an uprising  matt count tylieri is known for being quite the sadistic individual beating torturing his  servants sometimes publicly to show his hand to those who would cross him he would definitely be  a message to send if there were one  taliesin i have a plan  sam ive got one too kill him  taliesin well thats part of the plan  matt i would warn the longer we 
none	 wait making these messages the stronger we build this part of  the city but also the more warning and preparation time we give to those in the castle  so the choice is yours  liam we act now  marisha act now  laura against the briarwoods  travis count tylieri  taliesin heres my plan  matt the name tylieri catches your ears memory if you recall your captive back at greyskull keep  was previously the owner of the driver of the briarwoods desmond the one that beat him  senseless until eventually lord briarwood saw 
town	 this and then took him as his own driver  sam im just a small boy but weve seen mists at night strange things that come out when the sun  goes down are those focused around a central area of town or are those everywhere  matt the mists are a means of intimidation its merely a magical precursor to the undead minions  of the briarwoods they slink through those mists use them as cover if you see it run  sam thank you  laura we heard about green fog here is that something  matt in 
none	 the castle yes there are vents in what was once the garden i know not the nature of  these vents or what is being utilized to produce this foul noxious odor but it has put a scent on  the city for many years  laura do we know what killed the tree  matt we know not  travis and in your time do you know anything about lady delilah what she is  matt the few times shes walked the city its been procession and power she seems to enjoy the  attention shes a vain one 
none	 that one  marisha whos this  laura and travis lady delilah  laura does she come out during the day  matt she hasnt in almost a year but she has before yes  she walks in the sun unlike her husband  sam unlike her husband  matt yes  laura i dont think shes a vampire  marisha she may not be a vampire  travis i think shes a bitch  taliesin what do you think of a distraction  laura what kind of distraction  taliesin what if there was a way to start a 
none	 ruckus at the vedmeyer estate start a fire  maybe start a ruckus of some kind  sam the vedmeyer estate  taliesin the third house  sam the dukes okay yes  taliesin theyre going to be waiting and expecting us so if they think were attacking one  of the houses and then instead we attack the other while everyones rushing to deal with what they  think is the next attack we attack the second home and then when they prepare for us to attack  the third home thats when we attack the castle  laura 
none	 i like it  sam all right  marisha wait you want to go bambambam  taliesin today its just one weve already dropped one  laura the next attack will be on the briarwoods  sam well hes saying create a distraction  liam we make a big stink in the house were not going into  marisha that im cool with percy how much do you want people to see the de rolo family crest  how much do you want people to know of your presence here do you want a big proclamation  because i might 
none	 have that  taliesin will it put my sister in danger  matt its hard to say  taliesin they dont know that i know shes alive perhaps keep her just to surprise me  sam that symbol is not the de rolo family seal is it its modified  taliesin its a part of it definitely i want them to know they need to know  matt its a tough decision the symbol does carry the weight of the people and does carry a  beacon of hope but it as you said may put your sister in danger 
none	 its hard to say the choice is  yours in how you wish to use it  taliesin yes  marisha yes because i learned a trick back in the day from my father and the air ashari people  we used to do it as kids for fun but it might be perfect in this circumstance  sam i did it a little in college its fun  marisha dualwielding i can skywrite for you  liam how do you mean  laura like a giant sparkler  liam like a what  marisha in the future they came

none	 temporarily  matt yeah controlling weather on that scope is a little beyond your grasp you can alter elements  of it and you could darken elements of the cloud to form a message or a symbol if you would like  but actually removing the clouds that would be  laura can you poke a hole in them  marisha temporarily yeah  travis well remember that lets go pick a fight with a house  taliesin from a distance we pick a fight with a house from a distance so we can get to the other  house 
none	 and pick a fight there  laura is there just one of us who can make a big stink in the decoy house  sam i can probably make a big stink  laura you could definitely make a big stink  liam but you can catch up through one of those little doorways  sam please its big for me  laura how about this i use one of my exploding arrows you gave me  sam oh those are so cool save those for a person  travis its a good ranged stink  sam ive got magic

town	 coming off the house  marisha yeah i think i could  matt with a crack of thunder rainfall begins to hit on the city  taliesin really  laura of course  marisha why is it raining again  laura because its this fucking town its fucked no offense it wont be fucked soon  sam your town sucks weatherwise  taliesin so the northern house or the western house  matt the northern house is the one that count tylieri currently resides in or no my apologies  the northern house is the one that duke goran vedmeyer 
none	 currently exists in  the other is count tylieri  taliesin so this is the mess and this is our actual  sam im the mess  taliesin youre the mess  sam all right so youll earphone me when youre in position lets go quickly  were burning daylight  taliesin so probably from about here  marisha im going with scanlan  laura no come with us keyleth  sam if ive said it once ive said it a hundred times i dont need help  marisha i wasnt trying to help you i was trying to write

dung	 back on  taliesin i have put my hat back on yes  matt okay yes because youre very much visibly percy  taliesin not anymore im not  matt all right so you groups divide scanlan heading towards the northeastern house the rest  of you heading towards the northwestern house eventually you get to the outskirts of both  abodes and you can see the dark clouds in the sky occasional claps of thunder and flashes of  light even though its midday its pretty dark right now the few folks that are out and about  have 
none	 their heads covered with hoods and theyre trying to stay under overhangs to stay nice and as  dry as they can you are all soaked to the bone at this point just pushing through your cough is  still setting in pretty heavily at this point too you guys make your way to the outskirts of  the home you scanlan skipping along the boy that you are with your one weird wandering eye  find your way to the other abode so whats the plan  sam how far is the gate from the front door  matt 
dung	 its about 25 30 feet and the house that youre looking at right now its very  wellcrafted looks like its made from a lot of the fine timber of whitestone the lighter woods  and dark woods contrast with each other stained to show the variation in the two its a very  beautiful home  sam okay any guards anything around  matt currently you can see there is one guard visible at the front thats all you can see at  the moment  sam and if i walk around back is there any guards around back 
dung	  matt there is a second guard around back that is just now stepping out of an outhouse that is  situated behind the building  taliesin that would excite you i dont know why  sam sure because they havent phoned me to tell me that were ready to go i will become a  dragonfly and buzz into the dwelling  matt okay  liam meanwhile the twins are looking at our home sizing it up  matt all right keeping a close eye through the dark rainy atmosphere you can see on both homes  the interiors 
none	 are slightly lit there appears to be individuals at home in both homes you just  cant see who it is necessarily there is light in the interior as you turn into a fly and make  your way this little boy just walks and zip go ahead and make a stealth check  sam ten  matt okay you turn into a fly and make your way through the bars and begin buzzing over the yard  with your onetwentieth of a hit point in fly form make your way any of the nearby windows all  seem to 
none	 be shut the front door is closed there might be a gap but the guard is standing in front  of the door  sam okay again they havent phoned me so ill perch on the handrail or door frame or something  just above him and wait  matt okay he takes notice of your buzzing as you go by and goes back to his watching the rest of  you guys  liam were sizing up the other home  laura yeah oh how about this maybe we can tell scanlan to set off the thingy ill come 
dung	 running  out as my old crazy lady saying screams the house is under attack toward the guards guarding  this house and then ill just stand there as they react  liam i like it could we look at this house first  laura i thought we did  taliesin i thought you went to shoot the arrows in the other house  marisha no thats what scanlan said  liam what do i see im looking all over this house  matt right this house is also wellbuilt sturdy mostly wood construction but its all  dark wood 
none	 it almost seems to disappear against the gray skies above it if youre looking from a  downward perspective its a very drearylooking home built to look pretty for someone who doesnt  like a lot of color its two stories there are a number of windows on both stories looks like  there is a small garden out front that has been longignored and died and dried up just browns  abysmallooking other than that theres not much else to say on the building  liam no guards nobody watching  matt not currently any guards outside of it 
none	 no  liam i want to go for a circle around  laura stealthy stealth i cast pass without a trace on him  matt laughs and you stay within 30 feet of him  laura huh  matt can you stay within 30 feet of him  laura i guess i stealth behind him  matt all right both of you guys roll stealth  laura oh no which one should i use  liam 28  laura add ten  liam good  laura 36  sam jeez  liam thats pretty good what did you add oh 
town	 because of pass without a trace oh 38  matt there you go 36 and 38 boom  sam youre both discovered and killed  matt laughs immediately just like that you push into one of the nearby alleyways curve  around the side and make your way to the back portion of this and the gate is buttressed up  against one of the surrounding buildings its a warehouse of some kind to the point where  theres a little bit of space you can get over but its about eight feet up and it is a spiky  
none	 top but looking over you do see there is one guard that is slowly patrolling around the  outside and you see through the nearby window what looks like two humanoids that just crossed  paths at the front of the window  liam two humanoids are in the house theres a guard between the home and the warehouse thing  you just described  matt correct basically you didnt see it from your perspective once you went around the  alleyway to the other side of it you do see there is one guard that is slowly patrolling the 
none	  outside  laura whispers i can perch and take him out with an arrow  liam you do your thing yeah yeah  laura do you want to sneakattack him that might be smarter  liam ill start you follow  laura got it  liam all right  laura should we let scanlan do his thing first and then we sneak attack him set it all in  motion  liam yes  taliesin all at the same time then on the count of three  marisha what are we doing wait what  sam what all i 
dung	 heard is on the count of three whats going on  liam scanlan whatever youre going to do i want you to get ready to do it  laura and then well count to three and well attack  sam shouldnt i do mine first  laura yeah you do tell us when  sam oh you want me to do mine first  travis whenever youre ready  sam how about wait 30 seconds and go  laura got it  sam all right i turn into a triceratops  laughter  liam a what  matt im going

none	 its just a fable but its fun to pretend to be one sure  sam three horns and big  matt yep and out of nowhere this tiny fly boosh into a triceratops boom lands crushing  the man beneath you hes going to attempt to oh rolled a 20 on his saving throw so hes only  going to take half damage go ahead and roll 3d6 crushing damage  sam d6 i dont even have a d6 laughs wow 17  matt 17 whoa okay he did not like that okay he is crushed and he is prone 
none	 beneath you right  now groans  sam and for my move i bash down the door  matt all right go ahead and roll an attack  sam d20 18  matt okay yeah go ahead and roll another 3d6  sam three six that wasnt anything nine  matt nine plus three 12 points of damage you turn around and with a loud cracking sound the  whole outside of the doorway and most of the outside of the room is thrashed and destroyed  wood chunks go flying everywhere with a large roar you see part of 
none	 the inside of the foyer  collapses from that side of the building you basically take out a whole support and start  thrashing around you hear voices begin yelling out from in the household and immediately  five guards start rushing in from different rooms towards you all right two of which are holding  already armed and ready crossbows well get to that in just a second  sam okay  matt you guys  liam im going to run up behind the one guard and beat him in the back of the head with the back of 
none	  my dagger  matt okay go ahead and roll an attack he does not see you this is considered a surprise  attack  liam this is a surprise attack oh thats good ooh thats not that good so thats 17  matt that hits  liam that hits all right and then the second attack whichll also have advantage is 23  matt 23 also hits yeah  liam okay so sneak attack yeah so here we go plus get them mutters 25 for the first attack  or no 25 for the first attack  matt sneak 
none	 attack  liam that was it  matt right its a surprise round dont you get double damage for being an assassin  liam yeah so 50 all i want to do is gunk him like i do  matt and thats all you needed he had 45 hit points whack with one hit to the back of his  head he crumples onto the ground smacking into the wet grass around this field  liam and i look over my sisters shoulder and say grog you want to play  come on you want to play  travis grog 
none	 always wants to play  liam go for the door  travis fuck it i rage  matt okay  laura were just going straight into the house  marisha what are we doing were watching all this happen were all like oh there goes grog  liam yeah because youve said nothing  matt you guys right now watch as now vax runs over and tells grog to run in and go after the  front door  liam well thats not what i said i said do you want to play  travis no i took off running

none	 an inch thick  pvc sheeting you can buy it at sign supply stores  liam snores  matt i know liam shut up they asked me so i cut those into sheets you heat them up with a  heatgun or really hot hairdryer and you can bend it so that was the shape for these i ordered  aluminum chainmail off ebay straight from india and cannibalized it to make the sheets of  chainmail that i then epoxied onto the plastic and this is a pleather that i stitched together  and then adhered across it to 
none	 make the trim and thats how i made the armor  zac would you be willing to come on mines n crafts and do a little more detailed showthrough  of it because its really cool and theres details you guys cant see everyone was like let  him show off his swords and im like theyre not real swords  matt nah you can pull them out  zac yeah you want to show them off  matt sure i cant really grab them from here  zac thats very ineffective for battle matt  matt i know
