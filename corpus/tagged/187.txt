none	 into it for  everybody that wants to be a voice actor here i thought id throw out the question how would you  guys normally prepare for a voice acting role  matt okay prepare for a voice acting role i would recommend reading the lines for the  audition  taliesin fuck  marisha that was going to be your  matt yeah sorry  brian do you charge for this great advice reading a script  matt we can work out classes brian no i mean and ive emphasized this at other panels before  voice acting 
none	 is 90 percent acting ten percent voice and so for preparation not just for the  industry in general but for any sort of character role that comes your way is prepare it like you  would any character you want to read the dialogue get a feel for the personality take  whatever information is given to you about that character and then extrapolate from that to help  flesh them out a lot of times you get hes 25 to 35 parents died in a fire uses a machine  gun  taliesin blood type b  every 
none	 now and then you get blood type im not kidding  marisha yeah or the guy youd like to have a beer with  matt yeah japans really into their blood types and americas really into their have a beer  with  marisha yeah guy youd like to have a beer with  matt at least my first thing would be to make sure that you take the time to try and create a  character that feels fleshed out to you and dont feel too beholden to what little information you  have there just find something that 
none	 you feel is honest in the performance  marisha i love that it feels like that youre calling the world series right now from  everyone  matt and the back row  marisha the reverberation yeah  taliesin is it hard to understand us or is it relatively okay good  marisha its just us i think were hearing it  taliesin yeah  brian its slapping back against the back wall  marisha welcome welcome welcome to wednesday wrestlemania is what it feels like  taliesin thats a different panel  brian thats after this  matt brian 
none	 how do you prepare for a voiceover role  brian well i prepare typically i stretch  laughter  brian i call steve blum and i say hey man before i audition for this part youre going to  get no im not a voice actor but i do hang out with a lot of them and i can tell you that they  do prepare a lot of stuff and the people on this stage i think taliesin jaffe should be playing  every villain in every video game  matt yes  brian and ive been saying that 
none	 for years and i will continue to say that until the video game  makers will listen to me  marisha its true though theres been a few times that me as a very supportive girlfriend  matts gotten sides in and ive been like aw babe just taliesin  brian just hand that over to taliesin  marisha hearing him read through the wall and im like its not good just give it to taliesin  matt yeah ive been requested to go and audition on roles and ive told them in the room i mean  thanks but 
none	 you should really get taliesin in for this  taliesin this is an industry where occasionally some of us go in to read for something and were  like are you having these five people in for this i know i just read for this but you should  really have these other five people read this because im sure what i did was great and all but  this is a patrick seitz role what are you doing come on lets not kid ourselves here  marisha my favorite is when i get a voice reference and its laura 
none	 bailey  laughter  marisha im not kidding this happens all the time and im like do you want me to text her  yo you free wednesday  taliesin before my voice just recently cracked a little bit so before that i used to  brian puberty  matt we were all waiting  taliesin its crazy second puberty i used to get paired up with liam and now thats stopped  happening which is really nice  marisha you always have people that are  taliesin yeah who youre right there with  marisha yeah me and courtenay 
none	 taylor every time  matt you mentioned hearing voice matches of laura bailey i remember when they did the live action  resident evil movie that had leon in it because apparently the actor that played him had a french  accent so they wanted someone to dub his lines and sound like leon so they sent out an audition  to try and match the sounds and the audio clip was me i was the reference and i didnt book it  im genuinely really curious to meet whoever it was that did a better me than me i 
none	 havent found  him yet but one day i hope that helped you learn some tips and tricks about voice over  taliesin the most random voice over  marisha yeah i mean the real tips that you can get are just buy voiceover voice actor by yuri  lowenthal and tara platt go to how to be a voice actorcom by dee bradley baker  brian find any panel that fred tatasciore is at this weekend  marisha yeah go talk to fred hes here theres so many resources out there that are written down  and probably way 
none	 more eloquent than what we could tell you right now  taliesin yeah yuris book is great very helpful  matt these title cards are more eloquent than any of us right now  taliesin voice good panel hard  matt flight long thank you  hannah yall are way too modest like jeez come on now off of that i know you guys know how hard  being in the industry is and not only being an actor but also being a voice actor on top of  that i was wondering if you guys could talk to us 
none	 a little bit more about what the hardest parts of  being in the industry are what struggles have you had  matt who wants to jump off on that one  taliesin oh wow  marisha i mean honestly being a voiceover actor is the easier parts of being in the industry  oncamera is scary  taliesin i used to describe it to my friends with real jobs as its trading the illusion of security  for the illusion of freedom  matt and marisha thats a really good way of putting it  taliesin you can either 
none	 have the illusion of a job thats not going anywhere thats going to be  there for the rest of your life or you can have the illusion that you can do anything you like  and leave your house and go on vacation any time you like because you dont have a boss and youre  your own boss and your office is just your house and your bedroom and theres no reason to ever  leave your bedroom because youve got work to do and sleep is really a bad use of your office  really and why 
none	 are you sleeping weekends are for people who have real jobs what are you  yeah  marisha oh god lets go to the bourgeois pig thisll fix everything  brian hey say the first part again for those of us who are going to put it in the yearbook what  was the first thing you said  taliesin the illusion of security versus the illusion of freedom yeah you trade the illusion  of security for the illusion of freedom  marisha what we tell everybody is when you go to interview for your job and you do 
none	 it once and  youre like whew awesome we do that every day every time you audition its basically the  equivalent of interviewing for your job and trying to convince people why you should be there the  reality is you shouldnt no one should be its a desert its theres a serious water shortage  you guys no one should be there  taliesin the phrase i hear in my head every time i walk out of a booth is well this is it  thats the last job youre ever going to book its been a great 
none	 run youve done very well but  its all over now  brian thats just sam telling you that after you leave the booth  taliesinits time to go back and work at the video store oh man  brian yeah well im a writer so im not subject to the persecutions of the voice actors  but i am  taliesin you get discount coffee at the bourgeois pig  brian i do get discount coffee there well im not allowed there anymore but some places i get a  discount  taliesin its nice that they can look 
none	 at you and theyre like oh writer okay yeah  brian yeah exactly theyre like thats a writers beard and then i take it off and  taliesin its not a beard for anybody who actually has to audition for anything  brian yeah or be anywhere no but the business is the same regardless of which genre youre in  if youre an actor if youre a writer if youre a producer whatever youre trying to youre  trying to tell a story and youre trying to make a point and youre trying to be relevant while at  
none	 the same time trying to be yourself and so youre in a place where theres thousands and millions of  people trying that at the same time youre hoping something cuts through critical role is an  incredible example of something that has no reason to cut through the way it did like really it  doesnt and we talk about that all the time but it has resonated with people in a way that i think  good art connects us to and makes us have an intimate connection with enough to where were  willing to some people 
none	 drove and flew a long way just to meet the three of you  marisha and you  brian its crazy  marisha dude people are cosplaying as brian wayne foster okay  brian there are cats now thats what im excited about  matt well it  marisha oh sorry i feel like every artist or every creative wakes up one morning and starts  having this existential crisis of oh my god everything that i do for a living is just made up  i just make up shit oh my god nothing is real what am i 
none	 doing why are people paying me for  shit this is all a bad idea  taliesin we all spent six months just saying what is happening  marisha what is happening this is weird why are people watching this  matt to work the entertainment industry and be a somewhat sane human being means youre a  professional harbinger of impostor syndrome it is a perpetual process and in a weird way its kind  of healthy  taliesin you have such a solid respect for i was directing erica lindbeck in some show ages  ago and we 
none	 had this really fascinating interesting professor of medieval language or  something he was in and he was like well youve worked hard to get where you are and  erica bless her was like no there are people who have worked way harder than me that have  nothing im just really lucky hes like dont sell yourself short shes no you dont  understand how this works theres a hundred people just as talented as me im just really  lucky  matt four of them are in the parking lot with knives right now  matt can 
none	 i ride home with you  taliesin you have a really healthy respect for luck in this industry  brian i tell people that i slept my way all the way to the bottom  taliesin what you mean is you napped all your way to the bottom lets make one thing clear  matt now on a legitimate point too it is a job especially for voiceover that is built on  perpetual rejection it is a career that you do the work before its decided whether or not youre  paid for it to play off what you 
none	 were saying before its working youre doing your two weeks  at your job and you have to reinterview every two weeks for your paycheck after doing the work and  so it has to be a passion you have to do it not to make an extravagant living because well all  profess thats not going to happen usually you might be able to get by if you work really hard  but each of us has spent countless years in squalor trying to make something like this happen  you have to be able to push through the 
none	 rejection do it for the art of it do it for the love of it  and maintain being a good person because voiceover more than any other form of  entertainment does not really allow for douchebags to persevere  taliesin no were a small community  marisha yeah we eat douchebags for breakfast  matt i would not quote that  taliesin its weird that they come in breakfast cereal form now actually  brian im going to sit with that one for a little bit  matt thats the yearbook quote from the panel to take home 
none	 with you guys  taliesin douchebags for breakfast  matt the answer to that question is we eat douchebags for breakfast  hannah okay that will be accepted its interesting you guys talk about how you got your  start and how difficult it is to break in and matt i know that you started in high school  correct  matt right the tail end of high school  hannah right so what was that like still trying to get a ged and working and figuring that out  what was that like  matt oh it sucked to 
none	 put it into context here i wasnt considering pursuing voiceover when i  was in high school i was just getting into theater heavily and i was enjoying the performing  aspect of it but i was going to go into animation i grew up watching and loving cartoons  and i wanted to be an illustrator an animator and right as i was getting to the end of my high  school years i realized i no scary i dont want to that was not something i was as passionate  about as i thought i was and that 
none	 also requires passion in the face of rejection i had an  opportunity through a strange connection to do background voices in one series when i say  background voices i dont mean you got to be a side character this was like guys head who  explodes number seven or guy whose car gets stolen and goes no that kind of thing  taliesin was that mag 8  matt that was the mag 8 that was for the fist of the north star animated series  taliesin groans oh my god  matt i got to be one 
none	 of those guys whose head exploded but it was just enough of a taste for me  to go oh okay this is a thing and maybe this connection will help me didnt at all but it  was enough of a taste to really let me start focusing on that a lot of my time after that was  just thinking well what can i do to maybe someday pursue this i began to continue doing  theater taking classes learning trying to just better myself and then it wasnt until eight  years later back in about 2008 
none	 or so that i finally quit my job and was like let me take  this full on and fail or succeed you know i prefer not to live with regret i think regrets a  terrible thing and id rather fail and know that i tried and move on to the next endeavor than  spend the rest of my life going what if  hannah that must have been so scary though  matt oh it was really scary  hannah yeah  matt i downsized my entire life i had to go down to this tiny studio 
none	 apartment and marisha saw it  when we first met i had a kitch  taliesin we still have friends who live in that apartment actually that apartment is still in  our friends family were like youll get out of here one day  matt the sisterhood of the travelling box thats what it has become  taliesin its a pretty depressing place  matt it was doing temp work and odd jobs off craigslist and whatever i could to try and pay  the bills working as a barista at a barnes  noble cafe for a long 
none	 time working in warehouses  stocking shelves whatever i could do to allow me the time to continue to pursue this it took a lot  of years of busting my ass and trying to make it happen and slowly getting traction but it wasnt  an easy climb  hannah i bet okay so for the rest of the panel lets hear it what was you guys moment  brian i was sending ashley a picture ashley asked for a picture i sent a picture  no the back of matts head looks beautiful  matt thank you i 
none	 think its great that i can distinctly sense the type of laughter that is  evoked by brian foster  laughter  matt just an observation anyway sorry continue with your question  hannah no thats fine miss marisha tell us how did you get your start what was your lucky  moment  marisha ooh oh no  taliesin maybe another story  marisha oh no this is a long story you guys i dunno are there any singular lucky breaks  matt for some people but not really for us i dont think  brian werent you the 
none	 cash me outside how bout dat girl  laughter  brian thats what i told them at the airport to try and get us upgraded to first class but they  googled her and they were like that aint her  marisha always bet on mercer always bet on him no i mean i feel like my career and my success  when you look back in that introspective timeline of your life and it was all these little nudges  and hints just pushing me into the same direction and these weird little trail of events  that happened 
none	 that lead me one thing to another i am obnoxiously tenacious like maybe to a damaging  degree sometimes  audience member goldfish  marisha goldfish is very indicative of that i hate hearing no for an answer shouldnt say that  out loud either thats probably damaging but yeah i turn into that toddler whos like four  years old thats like well why cant i do this why and its like well thats because if you  jump off a cliff youll die why well gravity and terminal vel why and i just  keep asking why until 
none	 something happens  matt or conversely you cant play this because youre a woman  marisha why  matt you cant do this job as good because youre a woman  marisha why  matt you just keep pushing until eventually they dont have an answer for it  marisha yeah break people down with their own defense  taliesin you always remind me of the jason c lee character from mallrats i feel like ive been in  so many rooms that started with just because a chick reads comic books you think she cant start  some shit 
none	 ill kick your ass whoa no run  marisha thats true there has been like one maybe two times that taliesin has been to me  leave marisha go out  matt before you stab someone yeah  taliesin yeah never because yeah its always the i dont want to go explain this to the cops  later  hannah no we want to hear that story whats that story  taliesin oh god  marisha that story theres too many stories but no i dont know theres been  brian keyleth isnt the only one whos been to jail 
none	  marisha a strong perseverance and hard headedness and honestly just constantly  pursuing what made me happy in what i knew i wanted to do that ended up putting me at a  crossroads of acting and nerddom and it was perfect  brian i will say passion though because marisha even if shes just asked to help  participate in something or help step in to assist with something tiny she treats it as if it was an  idea she came up with she treats it with that same amount of passion ill say thats why now 
none	  shes becoming more famous than all of us and shell forget us soon  taliesin well you yeah  brian me first yeah  taliesin youre the first to go  brian the new guy has got to go first  marisha thanks man  brian youre welcome ill invoice you later  marisha yeah best 50 bucks i ever spent  taliesin i can think of several examples that are probably not true on that some good stories  sorry i beg to differ  brian us jetlagged it turns out is awesome  taliesin i am so 
none	 amused  brian lets do this every day  matt this is before drinking guys  taliesin i didnt have a moment  matt you didnt have a chance to you were thrust into the industry as a child  taliesin i was born into this i worked as a child actor i was in the  union before i was one years old i had a sag card i was doing this solidly until the age of  approximately 13 working oncamera  brian you couldve been boss baby  taliesin i couldve been boss baby yeah never going 
none	 to happen even back then i was really  interested in japanese cartoons and japanese animations which hadnt really become a thing  yet but i was really into it i was excited by the notion that they were going to be dubbing them  into english and we were still figuring out how that worked and because i was in the industry and  working all the time i came at it in that direction of well how are we going to do this  what kind of acting are you going to use for this what kind of 
none	 actors are you going to get this is  interesting from having that perspective i managed to interest enough people who found that  amusing to start a career in that direction at that time i was going to stop doing oncamera work  because  brian baywatch  taliesin the baywatch story which is definitely a story  marisha and brian tell the story  taliesin ill tell the baywatch story okay  matt taliesin tell the baywatch story  taliesin im telling the baywatch story i was 13 years old i had the worst haircut on earth  
none	 because its the hair cut you have to if youre an actor you have to have actor hair  im not kidding you cant mess with your hair because you have a photo  and when they call you in you got to look like that photo and that photo has to have  just enough hair that if they want to do something to it they can but not so  little hair that youre stuck with the haircut you have you have to have the bowl haircut boyish  thing thats awful and you have to have it 
none	 all the time until they want to mess with it  marisha photos are expensive change your hair you have to take more pictures  taliesin that makes your agent angry  brian what do you think baywatch wanted to do with that 13 year old taliesins hair  taliesin i was irritated i had a headache and i had to go to an audition for baywatch for some kid  who was upset because his grandfather died the dialogue was so bad the dialogue was so bad the  13 year old boy was going you dont really expect 
none	 me to read this and take this seriously right  this is so stupid this is weird a little creepy and theres a whole shower thing that i dont  oh god this is i was laughing so much and giggling through this serious grandpas dead  scene that my dad trying to be encouraging in his way was like well if you cant take this  seriously maybe you shouldnt be doing it and i was like oh my god youre right i should not  be put in a room with 11 other kids whose lives depend on 
none	 this shit thats a terrible idea there  are people who want this so bad call my agent i quit im done im going to my room im done  brian im grounding myself  taliesin i was instantly like no more working out i was like i want to stop working out  being a 13 year old who works out is weird i want weird hair i want to have fun i found out that  voice acting means i dont have to work out and i can have weird hair and keep acting that was  literally 
none	 it it was like i can have all the fun i had before except i dont have to do any of the  hard shit that makes it sound so cheap though it wasnt that easy it wasnt that easy but  thats a big part of it surrounding yourself with creative people who are doing good work  does help  marisha and seriously oncamera shit is terrifying  taliesin yeah i still do it every now and then to remind myself that its terrifying  matt its like touching the burner of your stove oh yeah that hurts 
none	  brian yeah mom was right thats a nono  taliesin you came in while we had that we were just starting to form this great group of people  who were constantly we dont hang out and watch movies together we hang out and make youtube  videos the people in our group are always doing shit we dont hang out together were like  hey do you want to come over and help me produce this short film that im putting into  yeah sure you need actors you need a pa what do you need  brian 
none	 marisha were not vine stars thats not what he said  marisha no were web stars its different  matt no i reject this notion  taliesin those two words dont go together  marisha matt were twitch famous matt  matt fake sobbing  laughter  taliesin i just want to point out thats like the cruise ships of the internet right there  matt its just water why is it just water  taliesin because thats all youve earned  laughter  hannah all right lets bring you guys back lets make you inspired and happy again  
none	 matt if it gets bad just clap loudly towards us  cheering  matt you could also get one of those animal training click things  hannah like a shocker thing  matt taser works thats good little extreme but functional  hannah okay so to bring it back up again lets talk about what your inspirations are guys lets  talk about who keeps you going  hannah and audience aww  brian johnny walker  taliesin jim to his friends  brian yeah i was saying that for marisha  matt i mean as far as just personal 
none	 life and stuff friends family the family we have and the  family we choose that makes a really really big difference especially in our city  taliesin the family we have time for these days  marisha the family we make youtube videos with  matt yeah those are the biggest points of inspiration keeping us together and not going  crazy in this crazy world gets crazier every day as far as career stuff what other inspirations do  you guys pull from what other people or what other types of art do you draw from  taliesin 
dung	 i have other creative friends especially older friends that are the people i  would like to grow up to be which is a horrifying thing to say in your forties i said it its  weird its the people who are older than me that have found a place that appears to be comfortable  although im sure its not and then the friends of mine who are starting out who remind me that i  have to work hard because theyre going to devour me alive and take all my jobs bless them  marisha youre so insightful 
none	  taliesin eh its mostly jetlag  audience member papa savage  matt papa savage brian  brian oh man i think on the show one night i said surround yourself with people that want to  leave the world better than you found it ive known these guys for a long time taliesins the  only person i met after the home game started but i knew you guys back in the cut as ive gotten  older too im 34 im not old but as ive gotten older i find myself surrounding myself  with people that are 
none	 not just motivated but are passionate like i was saying earlier and people  that are helping each other la and new york and places that are creative theyre also very  competitive and even though a lot of these guys are in the same industry nobody really competes  we seem to celebrate successes and we mourn losses together and its a family that you choose that  really inspires me plus i like to read a lot  marisha thats a good point though its a competitive thats there but inspiring and  youre always rooting for the 
none	 home team  brian yeah its iron sharpening iron rather than walking all over each other or secretly  going stab that bitch in the back like you and laura do behind each others backs  marisha oh yeah totally well you know  brian its where i got that idea from  marisha when she dies i get the other half of my soul i dont know what you wanted me to say  brian who couldnt that be said about  matt for me storytelling is very important on a basic scale when you consider both the classic 
none	  tribal elders around the fire telling stories and myths to the young we as a people as a species  thrive on being inspired by stories from those that came before us and thats been as long as  weve had speech as each generation every epoch comes by that transitions into media that we have  nowadays storytelling is even more important because thats what inspires us to want to create  to make the world better to make ourselves better to see a character in a story or a tv  series or a video game that 
none	 we aspire to be more like and make adjustments in our life to try and  be more like that character to feel more fulfilled and ultimately a better person i found  a lot of that inspiration through and it sounds so hackneyed because of what were here for  partially dungeons  dragons and role playing games were such an inspiration to me because it  gave me a safe space to discover myself and a safe space to step into the shoes of people who  werent like me that i could create or come to understand 
none	 different experiences and perspectives  through our show what were seeing now is this resurgence of tabletop gaming its one of the few  forms of media that people can be inspired by and then turn around the next day and go create  themselves that to me is incredible i think its amazing if anything from what our game has  done or our stream show whatever you want to call it our game is seeing so many of you guys  go out there and create your own adventures and send us pictures of your game groups and 
none	 tell us  stories of the things that your parties have done what inspires me to do anything that i do is the  hope that whatever art i create inspires other people to create better art in the future  marisha word  brian it does matt  applause  hannah do you guys have any good book suggestions  matt house of leaves its a really good horror book you should read it if you like horror books  read it at night with the lights low trust me  brian oh book recommendations city of thieves by 
none	 david benioff hes the creator and writer of  the game of thrones tv show he also wrote a book called the 25th hour which is incredible and he  wrote a book called when the nines roll over okay im recommending all three of his books  anyway if you like game of thrones its nothing like it but youll like it city of thieves its  an incredible book the video game the last of us was neil tells me 95 percent inspired by that  book so its a really incredible book so thats my recommendation i 
none	 also wrote a book that ones  pretty cheap on amazon  marisha come on shameless plug you brought it up  matt whats it called  brian yeah im a published poet ive made tens of dollars as a poet  taliesin damn  marisha its pretty dope  brian my book is called blackened white brian w foster its on amazon its a collection of  essays short stories i have another one coming out next year because it will be ten years that  ive been in los angeles and its called poisoned chalices reflections on an 
none	 almost sober decade  in la  marisha next year is your ten years  marisha and brian next year is my ten years  brian should we all leave are you supposed to go  taliesin i believe you get a convertible and head to vegas  marisha yeah  brian with a suitcase full of drugs in the trunk  taliesin its a suitcase full of games  marisha i automatically get my jeep wrangler right that just comes with my ten years  brian plane shift to vegas  taliesin you can only drive it in sandals 
none	  marisha i automatically get a medical marijuana card just with your tenyear anniversary yeah  great  matt it comes with your car registration taliesin book recommendations  taliesin i just cleaned up my bookshelf so im rereading a bunch of nonfiction that nobody wants  to read but the last fiction book i reread terry southerns magic christian because i was using it  for something i was writing which i love madly so i really like weird 60s pop ive got a thing  for it its a great book  marisha i guess im going to 
dung	 go off the fiction ramp  taliesin please because mine are awful  marisha since we were talking about creativity and how to inspire that ive been reading through  creativity inc which is written by ed catmull who was one of the founders of pixar he talks  about harboring a creative environment and helping the creative flow in the workspace its  just really good for anyone its good  brian whats the takeaway from it so far  taliesin something other than babies and cars you give those pattonstyle speeches in the office  every now and 
none	 then where you just stand up and start theres a story in this book you got to  know we all just sit and listen for a minute  brian storytime everyone gets on bean bag chairs  marisha i think just allowing creativity to flow and not extinguishing anyones creative flame just  because you think that your job title allows that it could be a pa it could be a writer it could  be someone in sales or marketing and anyone can have a creative idea and i think we all have a  responsibility to listen 
town	 to those creative ideas  brian regardless of where they are in the chain  marisha regardless of where they are in the chain because anyone can have an amazing idea i  think a good leader will listen to all of those even if they decide to implement them or not  brian then why have you shot down all my ideas for other shows  marisha well your names brian foster i mean  brian i wanted to have the show where they chase wheels down the street where you chase wheels  down the street  marisha 
none	 yeah well stop pitching porn and then maybe well talk  brian its vr but its an experimental form of  marisha i know but well talk back to the drawing board  matt to be fair we are in the valley next question  brian please  hannah i actually did want to ask have you guys ever had a role offered to you that made you feel  very uncomfortable that you didnt want to do that you had to say no to  matt ever had a role that we felt uncomfortable and said no to  
none	 taliesin part of your job as an actor one of the first things they teach you if youre going to be  an actor is that your job is to be very uncomfortable thats something that doesnt get  said very often is theres nothing that will kill your career faster than being im not  comfortable playing that part and theyre like okay thank you i mean there are places and  there are things obviously but i spent a chunk of my childhood crying being molested for abc  afterschool specials  laughter  taliesin childs cry with 
none	 peter coyote which you can find on the abc afternoon  im not even kidding i think its probably findable on youtube and you can watch a whole  courtroom scene where im crying and bawling describing terrible things that a baseball coach  did and what youre not seeing is that every ten minutes they stop as that lawyer forgets his three  words of dialogue while i have been sobbing for 45 minutes fucker you just have to remember  objection im nine what is your damage  while theres the creepiest looking baseball coach whos just looking 
none	 at me  going im so sorry dude i dont even know like hes okay  matt taliesin youre my favorite person  taliesin i mean obviously there are things but part of your job is to be excited by the notion of  doing something thats going to make you vulnerable as long as its the right kind of  vulnerable  matt yeah as a performer as an actor if its a space that you want to explore because it is  outside of your comfort zone and you want to stretch those muscles yes i have had 
none	 radio spots  that i read for and then didnt realize that the ideologies or the political circumstances behind  those pieces i was very fervently against and then said im good and turned those down  there was one video game that i read for or i didnt read for i was about to read for i sent  the audition they didnt send the sides i was supposed to arrive and get the sides and it was  for a motion capture project the game ended up being cancelled thankfully but i show up to it  they 
none	 give me the sides for the character i had a little bit of character background i start  reading through the script and it was just extremely racist extremely offensive  brian yeah but i told you i was going to do revisions  laughter  taliesin i felt it coming too oh no its like the wave at the shamu tank and its no no no  why did i pick the first row  brian im sorry please forgive me  taliesin goddamn dude im so proud of you  matt i can see what you were going 
none	 for brian but i felt the methods of delivering those things were  a little too hamfisted and the point was lost so i decided to decline and not go through with  the audition  brian i get it i found a new gig anyway  taliesin i guess there are auditions that i just turned down because im like no i dont want to  if its not a story im really behind yeah that does happen  marisha yeah theres a difference between getting a script for the scientology center and  being like nah im good 
none	  taliesin i always read the scientology scripts  marisha versus an acting role  taliesin yeah thats true i got my dad on their mailing list when i was 16  brian thats messed up  taliesin i am such a jerk  brian unless he enjoyed it  taliesin no he did not he still doesnt youre never off  brian ive never lost a role to anyone but thats because ive never gotten offered one i  did lose one to elijah wood though nah i dont know what that means im just kidding i like  
tavern	 him im not saying fuck that guy i dont want that to get out there i think hes cool frodo  i mean hes known for more than just whatever i sound like dan harmon  taliesin youre starting to  brian im starting to turn into him  matt youre spending too much time with him  brian yeah im turning into a fat drunk old man all of a sudden  marisha your white older drunk male is rubbing off its showing  brian yeah i know thats what it says on my badge actually white older drunk 
none	 male thats  it right there on the badge  taliesin its my favorite character class  brian is that in the campaign guide matt  matt you find that on dms guild i think  marisha you get advantage on constitution checks  matt disadvantage on wisdom intelligence and charisma any roles that youve turned down  marisha what taliesin said next question  taliesin next question  hannah guys if youre okay with it were going to do one more question and then well open it up  for questions is that okay for everybody  brian as 
none	 long as we could be able to see the person that asks  taliesin to be fair you could have all left we cant even see you  hannah i will ask that you guys keep it appropriate please we are all adults i think  maybe possibly  marisha i thought she was talking to us a hundred percent i was like oh no  laughter  matt says a lot about us  brian by the end of the weekend she will be  matt at least were selfaware cant say that were not that all right whats 
none	 the final  question  hannah okay final question is is there any projects that you guys are working on or hope to  be working on that you could tell us a little bit about  marisha actually this one a few just came out that i can announce i am super overdramatic and  ridiculous and insane in the friday the 13th video game thats coming out you can kill me so many  ways so many ways to kill me i am aj in that game  taliesin awesome  brian when does it come out on 
none	 friday the  marisha intentional mumbling comes out on google it yeah  brian you think it came out today said a voice  audience member i saw that on one of the store pages online  marisha that actually might be true  matt came out on friday the 26th missed the ball with that one guys  marisha i did have people tweeting at me how theyre like ive saved marisha two times  already i gave her a security blanket and some hot chocolate like legit that was someones  tweet  brian youre like thanks someones 
none	 going to come along and murder me with an axe  matt i dont know why but when you said that i imagined a wonderful game where you dont play as  the people being killed in friday the 13th you play as the emts that come up after the scene and  comfort the survivor  marisha the true heroes  matt press square to slowly rub their back as you ask them whats wrong  brian oh my god i would play that game  marisha its got a dialogue tree  matt theres a dlc where you 
none	 can bring like a help dog to come over  marisha a canine unit  taliesin therapy dog downloadable content therapy dog yeah there we are  matt that is for free you can run with it  taliesin the big one for me after over a year of waiting injustice 2 finally came out i get to be  barry allen the flash oh my god so thats really cool  marisha you and liam as reverse flash in that scene that came out was like the best thing ever  taliesin one of the guys who was actually 
none	 working on the animatic when i was in there he was like  do you want to see he was delighted i was delighted everyone was delighted we were giggling  like 14 year giggling oh the windmill giggling  matt im not going to lie im deriving so much enjoyment from all of the posts in recent weeks  about everyone complaining deadshot is so overpowered in the game and im like laughter  learn to zone  brian oh dang  matt i cant say who im playing yet but i can say that im in the star 
none	 wars battlefront 2 im  really excited about that a fun character in that one lets see what else can i talk about ndas  is a problem we all have like four chips in the back of our brains from warner bros blizzard  they can press the button any time and were done its like a remote battle royale scenario its  pretty intense and if you dont know what battle royale is watch that movie its great the  original japanese one the perpetual joy that is fire emblem heroes which i still play way too  
none	 much  marisha youre all welcome for effie being a badass just putting that out there  matt shes one of the most dangerous arena characters with the proper inherent skills  taliesin deep voice i like that im getting to use the wolverine voice more and more its really nice  brian oh that is really nice  taliesin deep voice its got a lot of treble its good regular voice i dont know where im going with that  marisha brian youre doing so much cool shit and you cant say any  brian i cant say shit 
none	 i cant say i have this phone right here  taliesin you think that were teasing him but were not  brian i have this picture of my lawyer and i just know that if  marisha hes on facetime right now glaring at you  brian ill just say that after i lost my job at the two broke girls show doing security by the  way i can say this now the shows been cancelled neither of those girls were broke that was a lie  i have a new gig but i cant talk about it ill 
none	 just say im stoked and when it is announced  youll probably hear something about it  matt yeah its really cool  marisha whispering no audio  brian about the oh yeah i was a part of that so if you guys know logic the rapper hes one of  my best friends and my writing partner he just put out an album and i was a part of that process  a little bit and working on a lot of cool stuff with him and the next record already if you guys  want to check it out 
none	 its called everybody i had a shirt on earlier but i took a shower because  taliesin and the shirt melted off dissolvable shirt  brian everyone on the plane the plane was like the stand our journey here friends to see you was  long but were glad to be here  marisha thats what happens when you fly american  brian the plane was sticky the windows were sticky the floor was sticky it was like they had  just filmed neighbors 3 inside the cabin of the airplane  taliesin does it ever occur to you that 
none	 maybe its just that youre really sticky so everything  you touch is sticky im not saying it wasnt sticky it was a sticky airplane  brian you know how some people are born with naturally moist hands what if i just had sticky  like spiderman yeah but isnt there a guy who has furry stickyi dont know why they got to be  furry but sticky hands you all right  taliesin other than my dad i think youre pretty good on that  hannah do we want to open it up for questions now on that note 
none	 i do have notes guys before  we jump into it  matt before we jump into it she has notes  taliesin theres going to be a short quiz  hannah can i have everybody hold on one second one thing these guys are lovely but they cannot  stay for signings i encourage you to check your momocon app to see where theyre going to be next  follow them around like little birds  taliesin we have a few more signings  hannah also at the end please stay seated this is for your safety we want 
none	 to get people out in  an orderly fashion not like cavemen or women to not be sexist  taliesin caveperson  hannah so please stay seated  all cavepeople  matt highpitched its high noon normal voice sorry  taliesin id play that app  marisha chibioverwatch  taliesin chibioverwatch i would totally play chibioverwatch especially if i got loot boxes  for it  matt choverwatch  hannah thats all the notes that i have so lets do some questions  matt all right oh theres already  marisha can we bring house lights on a bit  
dung	 hannah so we can see our lovely people  matt banish these shadows from the land  taliesin right now i feel like were facing the grand inquisitors  audience member how to do this  matt no we are doomed to a thousand more years of darkness guys im sorry  marisha i guess we can go ahead and get started man in the dark whats your name  audience member im daniel  all hi daniel  matt hows the abyss  daniel its nice  matt there we go  cheering  audience member let there be 
none	 light  marisha i see your face now  daniel thank you my first livestream was the crucible fight with grog thats probably going to  be ingrained in my mind forever  matt good  daniel what are some of your most memorable moments from the show before the goldfish  taliesin doesnt remember much after  matt first off i was really scared about that fight because i was like oh great im going to  have a oneonone with two bruisers thats going to be great for people to watch and play because  its just two 
none	 people the rest of the partys like all right so i was really happy that  travis went with me on the narrative elements of that and we turned it into a fun dynamic  battle  taliesin that was the last time ryan made popcorn that was nice  marisha so awesome  taliesin it was really good popcorn  matt most memorable moments of the show you guys go first  taliesin god do i have to pick  marisha so many  brian hells  taliesin hell was great almost drowning underwater was great  marisha i 
none	 was going to say the kraken fight was intense  brian cows  taliesin i was sick for that marisha cows ill never forget cows  taliesin i watched cows  brian kevdak  matt im so sorry for any of you in the audience that has not watched the show and right now is  going what the hell are they talking about cows  brian im just going to keep yelling oneword random shitvorugal  marisha kicking kvarn in the face was pretty dope  taliesin finally firing that arrow into the orb was pretty great that was 
dung	 solid  matt from a dungeon masters standpoint i still thank you ten minute sign there was  something so weirdly frightening and satisfying and delightful spending so much time building up  emon and taldorei and then in one fell swoop just destroying the city oh man  taliesin like a kid with a cardboard box  matt i recommend it sometime  brian you recommend someone spending thousands of hours creating a world and building it up and  then destroying it  matt isnt that what simcity is  brian hell yeah  matt and isnt it 
none	 fun  brian hell yeah awesome  taliesin lock them in the pool  taliesin well try and be quick because theres a line  brian yeah go ahead whats your name  audience member hello im thomas  all hi thomas  thomas im a sound designer and composer for games so i understand the taxes and the sticky  airplanes and all that stuff my question for you guys is how do you deal with monotony when it  comes up in your professional life and  brian monogamy  audience member that too but monotony when things 
none	 just become really repetitive or routine  taliesin weirdly i got to say maybe this is a function of la i dont think ive had a  repetitive day in 35 years or so  matt you also live in a very unique plane of existence taliesin  brian yeah taliesin you sleep in a different coffin every night what are you talking about  taliesin theres a curse and theres some things i have to do  brian i know ive seen the clipboard  taliesin god  matt for me change of scenery self care is a very 
none	 important thing in any creative field because  it can be a very soulcrushing experience at times and the monotony in any job can become a  very difficult thing to maintain so you owe it to yourself when you feel that drudgery take over a  bit to walk away and force yourself to go to a space thats unfamiliar a space that is different  and forces you out of your comfort zone and you have to adjust partially because it shakes your  system a bit but you might end up discovering a location or people or 
none	 an environment that you  never thought youd enjoy before and it might unlock some interesting passions and reinvigorate  aspects of your life that you didnt consider until that moment its amazing what a change of  scenery can do even if its just taking a walk if you have writers block or something along those  lines just getting yourself out of that stagnant space that you found yourself in and run in a  different direction for a while  taliesin just to quickly add to that there is information in the ether that surrounds us  
none	 theres this notion that life is designed in its very dna to be toil and the notion of any kind of  delight or pleasure is a strange aberration from the toil that life is supposed to be i assure you  this is not true you are currently at a convention full of people enjoying themselves and  this is an important and necessary thing youre supposed to do every day in some way toil is  almost the weird one really know that youll do better work if youre happy and enjoying yourself  any way you can 
none	  brian yeah and i would say fresh eyes fresh ears if you write give it to somebody to read  that doesnt normally read the kind of stuff you write if you make music get fresh ears and fresh  eyes on whatever you create maybe somebody that wouldnt normally listen to it its good to get  an outside perspective on something i think that helps me creatively  taliesin sound design is nuts too  brian yeah sound especially  audience member we might be giving you guys a call at some point  matt all righty 
none	  brian as long as youre not with law enforcement youre more than welcome to  matt is it a subpoena  audience member yes  matt oh god i know who you are now thank you very much  audience member yeah of course  matt hey whats your name  audience member be pleased  marisha beep beep  matt bidet  audience member i was at the charlet chung panel and she touched on this bit where directors would  give really weird descriptions of the kind of sound they were trying to get whats one moment 
none	  that sticks out for you  matt of strange script directions and sound effects  audience member if you want to give an example  marisha one was with taliesin as the director  taliesin i do that a lot  marisha with me that i reference all the time that was akibas trip  taliesin which piece of direction  marisha it was i need you to attack like a cat person like a halfcat halfperson  taliesin sounds like me  marisha and i need you to be incensed that as youre attacking your clothes are being 
none	 ripped  off  taliesin that sounds like me matt because japan  marisha because japan and so i was like  taliesin did i say because japan  marisha i think because japan got dropped a few times  taliesin yeah if i recall that was definitely said several times during that game  marisha and it turned into a screeching cat noise i dont know it was weird  taliesin you did pretty good if i recall  marisha it was all right it was fine  taliesin that was a good one  marisha and brian it 
none	 was fine  matt a lot of scripts get weird interesting sound effect noises things i love are when the  scripts give you have especially if its in a long row you have the line of dialogue and next  to it you have the direction that the writer has for the certain feel of the line i love the ones  that are so why did you write that down where the line is thank you and the descriptor is  like thank you and youre like oh man thank you  brian whoever put that in there 
none	 sam always instagrams really funny ones because he does a  lot of voice directing and itll say person is on fire and it says person acting on fire  gotcha i think person on fire is enough why do they always add the thing you guys arent dumb i  think you guys could look at that and go oh they need a person on fire  marisha one of my favorite ones i think it was for the old star wars battlefront and it was this  line where youre yelling yelling yelling and then i got to 
none	 a certain point and it was like  just more yelling i remember taking a picture of that one this is my job right now more  yelling  taliesin well text each other if theyre really good  marisha yeah if theyre really good  matt if youre lucky enough ive been in a couple of shows where ive known the writers or  friends with the writers on it and so theyll leave things in the script for you every now and  then im so sorry for this like apologizing for certain lines of dialogue or theyll 
none	 write  lines in the scripts just to mess you up and then theyll be like all right no the real line is  actually down here  brian thats messed up  matt ive had a couple times where id get to a line and be like really  brian every word starts with p  matt yeah how do i then the directors in on it theyre like yeah if we can get a few takes  on that and im like okay all right sigh and then deliver this ridiculous line that makes  no sense in 
none	 context  brian i liked paula abduls first three albums but the last three felt  matt stuff like that and then like all right cool we got that on tape ill go ahead  and send that over to michelle now well get you the actual line  of dialogue im like angry noise you  brian thats messed up  matt thank you thats a good question we should go faster lets go faster must go faster  marisha hey oh hi hannah we have about two minutes left  audience member my question is for marisha and 
none	 taliesin what was the most defining moment in  your character for either keyleth or percy for a turning point what moment is the most important  to that character  matt lightning round  marisha i think about patrick rothfuss and talking her down out of a panic attack quite a  lot because the rest of vox machina was too distracted and too in the moment and he was an  outside force that was like yeah lets relate for a second lets go outside and relate  hey girl you want to go relate  audience member 
dung	 sure  matt and marisha go relate and chill  taliesin ripley and orthax in the dungeon was the moment where im like okay i finally figured him  out when he was finally having that what is happening to me what is my life hold on that  was his moment of actually getting some clarity  matt cool  all great question great costume  marisha clank clank clank  audience member true disadvantage on stealth rolls  marisha true disadvantage yep now you know why  audience member this is my friend lindsey its her first con 
none	 and shes going to ask the next  question  matt hi lindsey  lindsey obviously there are plenty of classes to be taking that are helpful for voice acting and  writing for you guys what has been the most beneficial class that youve taken  marisha improv  matt improv has been huge improv and cold reading  taliesin cold reading classes theres some classical theater i liked learning history of  theater it was very useful  marisha the hardest part is picking a few things and committing 100 percent in those cold reading  auditions and 
none	 even if it sucks at least the director knows you can commit  matt yeah make a choice and stick to it  marisha make a choice making a choice is massive and then the director will say new  choice and you go no im faye dunaway and then you go and then thats a new choice  matt brian and marisha always faye dunaway  marisha never go full faye dunaway  taliesin not even faye dunaway goes full faye dunaway  brian no she knows better  marisha but that tells them that youre malleable and can 
none	 be directed and can make a strong choice  even if it sucks  matt awesome thank you good question  brian if youre a writer just google david milch and watch any video where hes talking because  hes a genius thats not a joke  hannah guys im so sorry that was our last one  all gasps wait wait one last one  brian our panel tomorrow is going to be an hour qa so you can always ask questions tomorrow  audience member this is inspired by matt because earlier you mentioned marisha you mentioned she 
none	  was shut down because a woman cant do this or whatever this is probably a good general  persevering question im a woman about to go into a tech industry which is a maledominated field  marisha what do you do to pep talk yourself essentially during those times its probably  like i said a general thing  taliesin thats a good one marisha its very layered  audience member i know im sorry its a bad last question  marisha no its good  matt its a good question though  marisha great question first and foremost 
none	 i always try and speak to our boys our guys in the  audience and say you also have a responsibility here feminism is not a femaleexclusive problem  this is a team issue everyone has a responsibility here i do a lot of stuff super  subconsciously if i have a big meeting ill wear a buttondown shirt and slacks and boots what i  try and keep in the back of my mind is that im not the first and i wont be the last and there  are more allies than enemies find your allies they will 
none	 be your guiding force and your strength  behind you but to definitely persevere you got this girl you good  brian dont take no for an answer like she said  marisha dont take no for an answer  audience member love you guys marisha do not take no for an answer  matt thank you guys im so sorry for the people who we couldnt get to your questions we have  other panels this weekend so if you didnt get your question answered bring it to the next  panel well try and get to it then
