none	 weird timeslot for you we still play roleplaying games on monday nights they are just  minicampaigns instead of the epic long brainchild of matt mercers amazing imagination  instead we do little oneoffs like we just got done playing army of darkness which was then  created by chat it was coined the arbys of darkness because their last stand was in the  middle of an arbys restaurant which one of the characters managed and officially  marisha thats amazing  ivan it was pretty cool  taliesin what meat is this what meat is this  ivan 
none	 the deadites actually came out through the portal at the very end of it and they were all  the busboys and the ill swallow your soul ill swallow your soul  taliesin thats every arbys ive ever been to  phil really its the same thing  ivan and the next campaign that were going to be doing officiallyunofficially is going to be  pugmire which is a new game its basically 5th edition in a world of fantasy dogs its  a postapocalyptic future  marisha i was going to make a joke about that and then it 
none	 was the real thing so  ivan it exists its in the future in which all man has been wiped out and now dogs reign supreme  and they have formed a church called the church of man in which they have a code of laws the  first law being be a good dog the second law being fetch what has been left behind and the  third being i believe its bite only those who attack you so its great  ashly im imagining mad max with dogs in my mind now  ivan but its fantasy its 
none	 still fantasy  ivan so you could be like a pincer cleric or you could be a dachshund rogue or something like that  matt thats fantastic  ivan so 7001000pm usually on mondays come hang out  matt do it check it out guys its pretty fantastic so another cool thing about having  paizo the folks from pathfinder here is we have a bunch of giveaways to give out throughout the  evening to all you guys in chat  marisha like theres a bag of stuff i dont even know what it is its exciting  taliesin

none	 of tonights fun is at certain points during the  story if you roll really crappily on a roll or you want to get that extra action in youre doing  good and you want to get that extra attack or extra ability each of you have constructed and  have at your disposal a goblin song that is custom to your character you may choose to sing this  song out loud on the stream and doing so will gain use of that reroll or that extra action use it  sparingly its only once in a while possibly 
town	 a onceanight type circumstance but im exci  burps pardon im excited to hear all of your individual songs as we progress  marisha so excited it gave him indigestion  matt its how its the reaction i get nervous guys great so that being the case lets go  ahead and get this show on the road  marisha oh my god im so excited  ivan there we go goblin pants  marisha also im using liams dice box because hes not here and he cant stop it  laughter  ivan liam im touching your stuff im 
none	 touching your stuff  marisha im going to rub my butt on it  matt here in the sandpoint hinterlands nestled in the western side of the devils platter  mountain range there lies the birdcruncher tribe of rather rambunctious goblins known for their  deft trapping skills having earned their name and the majority of their food supply by snaring wild  birds and eating them raw you five have grown up together here among the caves and cliffs over the  past six years outliving many of your other brethren making you tough although most of you  
none	 were the runts discarded as weak and useless you were all taken in and raised within your cages  which is how most goblins are raised by the sagely guffeye  ivan guffeye  matt an ancient goblin oracle of nearly 30 years of age who enjoyed the idea of having her  own troop of personal guardians she shouts that she is touched by the sight of zogmugot lady  lastbreath and the goblin herogod of flotsam and scavenging though many of her visions have led to  grave misfortune and her favor within the tribe has waned but 
dung	 you guys believe her mostly  ivan zogmugot looks favorably upon our lovely guffeye  matt this cold overcast autumn morning rolls in and the five of you are returning from a morning  snare run when you hear the sound of crackling shouts from old guffeyes crag porch come come  the dream the sight come  and she darts back into her little cave hole  ivan guffeye has another dream you know what that means  phil someones going to lose a hand  marisha usually this means shes been drinking i just want to point that 
none	 out  ivan well lets go see what the old windbags up to because you know its going to involve us  probably dying  phil probably  marisha lets go  matt entering her home the familiar smell of pungent spices and rotting wood hits your nose  and this hoarder hole of a home is crammed to the brim with driftwood molded leather metal scraps  torn hides broken pottery all sorts of other beautiful pieces of junk  ivan its amazing  matt nostalgia comes over you as you glance at the empty iron cages you once 
none	 grew up in now  partially buried and filled with wet wool as you guys enter old guffeye steps onto a small box and  turns her snowblind eyes clouded and bulging above her toothy grin my runts the lady gifts  guffeye the wait is broken i have a vision once more a thing a great thing was shown to guffeye  in both these eyes a stone of crack and thoom a rock that barks like the storm this rock this  stone guffeye must have this guffeye must get you you must get this stone bring it 
none	 to me for  the ladys blessing  ashly guffeye if i give it to you first will you like me the best  matt i already like you the best  ashly yes  matt but i will like you twice best  ashly oh my god  ivan guffeye as your esteemed and most intellectual advisor i have to ask where did the  lady bestow this vision upon you that we may find the barking rock  matt well i awoke this morning envisioning just how much more i like piglet than the rest of you  
none	 ivan but i just got done scrubbing all of your sores last night  matt silence  ashly sorry guffeye  matt upon brewing my morning thatch tea the vision struck my face i dropped it it shattered  in a beautiful clattering of broken pottery and i saw before me a reminder that today is a special  day the sun the sun rise highest in the sky today is the day of the human festival in  sandpoint filthy stupid human festival the lady showed me a man a man in blue blue  everywhere in robes a 
none	 church man spits  spitting  matt his name was zaan hold on  all zaan  matt zaan zantos  all zantos  matt guffeye saw the people around the churchman at this festival the churchman has the storm  rock on him  ivan ooh storm rock  matt so go to this sandpoint go to this human festival find this blueskinned bluerobed  churchman and take the stone for guffeye yes  ashly that sounds pretty easy like nothing bad will happen  ivan easy exactly we got this  matt the lady also showed me other 
none	 goblins know  marisha what  matt stupid stupid seventooth tribe also wants stone going to city now  ivan why would the lady show them the blue stone  taliesin four tooth too many thats  ivan seven tooth too much two tooth is best tooth  marisha i agree i agree  ivan two tooth is best tooth  matt you go sneak in find churchman take storm rock before seventooth dumbdumbs bring  back to guffeye get blessing and good meal promise  phil oh well if theres food  taliesin and drink  marisha yeah only 
none	 with a good meal and a drink you got it  matt this i can provide  ashly and dessert  marisha yeah  matt piglet youre now second most favorite  ashly wailing no i didnt mean it i dont want dessert  phil greed diminishes you  ashly crying  matt bring me stone become first favorite  ashly okay okay  matt now go time is wasting  ivan singing blue stone blue stone we will get it all blue stone blue stone then well eat  them all stupid seventooth is going to burn and burn 
town	 and die burn them all burn burn burn and  burn and die yay  matt laughs as you guys exit the cavern you go to your various hideyholes gather all your  materials your weaponry whatever things you think you may require on this journey you know  that the direction is northwest past the ravenroost mountain pass towards this town of  sandpoint and that is where your path lies the clouds begin to gather overhead at this point in time  ivan ooh best weather for scavenging  phil nice and clammy  ivan they wont even 
none	 see us coming because were goblins  matt a gentle rain slowly begins to hit down from the sky above  ivan how long is it going to take for us to get to sandpoint  matt depends on whos the best leader to find their way there i guess  ivan grizznak is best leader  ashly i am best leader  ivan grizznak is smarter  phil which way do your feet point  marisha whoever said you were the smartest  ivan because i am the wizard and the wizard is always the smartest this is simple 
none	 goblin logic  marisha that is pretty good logic i agree with that  ashly but i have a big hammer  ivan but you are look  taliesin she does have a big hammer she has a very fair point  ivan guffeye already tells you that you are the most elite of guffeye so we dont want to soil  poor piglet into having you out at front best to let snizzler and grizznak lead the way  taliesin youre the most complete you heard him thats absolutely true  marisha i agree with that yeah you dont 
none	 want to tarnish your beautiful shining reputation  ashly youre right she would be so sad if i died  taliesin tarnish the tarnish the handle of the yeah its  ashly yeah thats true she wouldnt care if you guys died but if i died shed probably be sad  marisha exactly exactly  phil besides whoever is in front is most likely to be shot in the face with something  marisha right so naturally were better to lead am i right grizz  ivan yeah you got it snizzler grizznsnizz all the way  marisha grizznsnizz  
none	 ivan so im assuming im going to make some navigation  matt i would like for you to make a survival check as the leader of his group  ivan haha yes leader  marisha grizz or snizz  matt well whoever one is leading  marisha well hes leading  ivan im clearly the most intelligent goblin in this troupe  marisha oh boy youre so smart  ashly do i smell mutiny already  phil i think i smell lunch  ivan but i think i dont know if i want to burn my song already  marisha 
none	 look grizz look im really good at building things so naturally i know how to  survive better  ivan you did make the best leanto  marisha i did i did in the boy scouts  ivan we went to juvie together  marisha we did good times can i try  matt well well say you let laughs you let him lead for a while  marisha all right  matt as you start heading northwest as you begin to pass the south part of the ravenroost mountain  pass youre led into a relatively thick patch of 
none	 very very painful bramble thicket chunk  ivan underbrush is the best  ashly im beginning to regret rescinding my offer to be the leader  ivan everyone knows goblins know that the most painful path is usually the right path  matt and the most painful path does manage to deal two points of damage to all of you as across  your flesh being dragged through the bramble thicket  marsiha thats only your own selfloathing grizz jesus ow  ashly i could use a writing utensil  ivan oh that hurts  matt until eventually snizzler decides 
none	 to rise up in frustration and take over the leader position  marisha jeez all right come on let me see  ivan here take dick bone that is the leader staff  marisha all right thank you we got it from an old badger  matt go ahead and make your survival check  ivan i swear this is best  ashly oh no thats not a good reaction  matt so  marisha i rolled a natural one  taliesin and they were never seen or heard from again game over  matt well done  ivan were 
none	 running the best goblin scenario ever right now  marisha are they going to make it out of the brush  taliesin like brownies and willow man were done for  matt wading deeper and deeper into the bramble thicket now under the guidance of snizzler  marisha look its just about finding the flow  phil the flow is up my buttocks  matt you all take an additional one point of piercing damage as youre  scratching your way through  ivan it hurt guys guys i dont know but i think i have one more rash that 
none	 i didnt have  previously somewhere  marisha oh jeez theres poison oak everywhere  matt the rain intensifies starting to echo through the mountain ranges in the distance the  storm appears to be getting relatively stronger however during this travel the rain that is  washing down the side of the mountain does lead you to a position of the thicket that isnt quite  so heavy and eventually you guys make your way outside of the immediate  physical danger of the terrain  phil congratulations  taliesin theres got to be some cover around here  
dung	 marisha i think were further than we started  ivan see at least were not at the cave anymore  ashly piglet doesnt like lightning can we go somewhere where theres no lightning  marisha okay  ivan well are we close to a tree because trees are really good to have cover under lightning im told  ashly i wasnt sure whether or not you were the smartest but thats the best logic ive heard all day  marisha i agree i agree you kill it every time grizz  ivan thats why im the wizard singing thats why 
none	 they call me the greatest  marisha you always did read the most  phil you call you the greatest no one else calls you that  ivan well grizznak is the greatest  matt at which point a large bolt of lightning hits a tree maybe about 20 feet off from  you sending sparks flying the tree bursts into flames and tumbles onto the ground i need  marisha holy shit did you see that dude  ivan look look zarongel smiles upon us see hes lit our way  ashly you said that lightning didnt like trees 
none	  marisha that was rad bro oh yeah  ashly i dont know about these guys  ivan so with no cover and nothing around it i have a feeling maybe we should make a mad dash for  either caves or potentially sandpoint were not anywhere close to sandpoint  matt youve done a few loops in the area  ashly weve been looping  matt did anybody else want to try and lead this expedition  taliesin did you want to go which way no i know which way im going to go and im going to  
none	 walk in a direction follow me  matt all right mezek  marisha i love family outings  taliesin what am i rolling i just rolled what do i add to it  ivan survival  taliesin survival where is survival 19  matt all right  ashly finally  ivan dont screw this up  matt and with this mezek for as far as goblin franticness is concerned manages to medicate  himself with various alcohols to a state of concentration pushes forward deeper into the  forest against your better judgement but in doing so stays out from 
town	 the rainfall manages to  avoid a lot of the lightning storm which is now blowing over the southern portion of the mountain  range and leads you guys over the next couple hours through a bit of a muddy sloshy forest  terrain towards the outskirts of the actual town  ivan is it still night or is it still  matt oh no its about midday now its pushing youre pushing into like the early  afternoon at this point youve lost a few hours on your journey  taliesin there i only take about two hours of 
none	 responsibility today and im done its someone  elses problem now  phil i will lead now that i can see where im going  ivan hey lets do the circle thing again that was fun  marisha that was fun like a game  taliesin was that fun because ive experienced what i thought was fun before and it was nothing like that  phil most of my fun does not hurt quite so much  ivan as they say no pain no gain  phil i dont like the ones who say that  matt all right guys 
town	  ivan as they say no pain no shame  phil i think they just like to rhyme  matt following mezeks path you eventually make your way through the forest alongside the  southern side of the lost coast road coming upon the edge of the trees to the tyrandarock river  it surrounds the town of sandpoint itself and encompasses it its a port town thats set on the  ocean and this river surrounds the outskirts of it so you find the edge you hit the muddy banks  of this river and looking across you can 
none	 see now the actual city proper  phil browntooth is very into city planning so this is very interesting  laughter  ivan im into city burning thats my favorite  marisha especially if theyre human cities  phil yes  ivan burning burning so i think because my survival ability is so amazing id like to  propose that i try to fashion some sort of flotsam with zarongels guidance i would like to  try to take some flotsam and make some type of floatypushy thing that we might wade the wiver  wade the river  ashly 
none	 wade the wiver  ivan wade the wiver to get across to the city not even bothering to look for a bridge  matt sure  marisha you know we dont use no dirty humanmade contraptions  ashly wait wait wait why dont we just swim  marisha no no no look the snizz can do a lot of things the snizz does not swim not very  confident in my swimming abilities  phil im not sure the snizz can do a lot of things  thunder  ivan oh zarongel smiles on us again yay  matt as 
none	 you guys glance from the flash  ivan smite another tree zarongel sorry  matt its okay you see the bolt of lightning strike a distant watchtower on the far side of the  city that has a rod specifically to pull these types of things out of the way  ivan stupid idea  matt glancing over ill have you guys roll a perception check if you could everybody go ahead  and roll perception  ivan solid 17  ashly 17  phil ten  taliesin natural one  matt marisha  marisha ten  ivan 17  
none	 matt all right so we got two 17s here from you guys al right so as you guys are glancing about you  can see the city before you and it generally loses most interest to all of you especially mezek  who while your direction sense has been great today once you get to the actual location of your  intent youve lost all interest and youre playing in the mud the thick clay on the side of  the river smeared on your face  ivan i want to kick any sculptures that he makes out of mud 
none	  matt okay  phil make sure its mud  ivan whatcha going to do about it mezek whatcha going to do about it  taliesin wait til youre asleep  matt now youre not sure if it was mud because it spooked you a little so the two of you glance  over and you can see there are two bridges that lead to the city itself that go over but both of  them look extremely heavily guarded you have two passes of three sets of guards that walk back and  forth armed with crossbows you guys 
none	 do as the midday rain is still pouring down and its causing  the surface of the river to spatter you can see theres a little bit of what would have been a  morning marine fog thats been burning off since it went out there so its no longer really  at your disposal however you two do notice right across the river against the bank before it  rises up to the top of the city itself you see barely visible the outside of a metal grate some  sort of a subterranean sewer or tunnel system that 
none	 is sealed shut across the way its a good say  80 to 100 feet across that river right now and it does have quite the current to it probably  because the rains been pouring for most of the morning  ivan goblins plus sewers equals awesome  matt smart one here doing the math  ivan yes so we have to wade the river in order to get to the grate  matt what do you want to do to get there its up to you guys  ashly do we have to go to the grate  
none	 matt you dont have to  ashly i dont like lightning and i really want to use my hammer as a result those two things  are connected dont question  phil can you swim with your hammer  ashly i just want to smash the dudes guarding the bridge  phil are there guards on both bridges are there guards on both bridges  matt yes  ivan look i think just putting it out there that grate is really really good because theres  no people in there and humans are dumbdumbs  ashly are you not goblins 
none	 do you not like smashing humans skulls  ivan i like pewpewpew humans skulls i dont like to get in all up in the face thing piglet  ashly i think hes a coward  ivan how dare you call grizznak the great a coward and i want to i dont have magic mouth  i want to grease her i want to cover her in grease  phil who doesnt  taliesin this got weird quick all right  ashly do i roll to not get greased  phil we dive in the brambles and then begin to grease 
none	 each other  matt it has started the game has indeed started  ivan i will show you true power as grease spurts out from my hand  ashly i will roll against grease  matt yes for you i need you to make a reflex saving throw so go ahead and roll a d20 and add  your reflex  ashly 19 i will have you know plus my reflex  taliesin theres a little box right there  ashly oh five  matt you rolled a 19  ashly 19 plus five  phil yeah she rolled a 
none	 19  matt you go and raspberry noise begin to spew grease from the outside of your goblin staff  piglet however a little ball of anger and muscular rage instead darts out of the way  slamming into the side of the sandbank that you are currently playing in the mud and clay with  causing that to collapse partially onto you you are now partially buried under the clay and what  little bit of your head is pointing out is now being sprayed with grease  taliesin sputters coughs  ivan oh sorry that was meant for 
none	 piglet okay high five all is forgiven  phil i say we do the opposite of whatever he wants to do  ashly so were going to get the humans were going to smash em with hammers and other sharp  taliesin were supposed to be stealthy can we do it and be stealthy  ivan i think stealth is better  taliesin is there a way to smash humans with stealth  phil how many guards are there  matt looking theres about six to each bridge that you can see  ashly can i tell if its more 
town	 advantageous for any reason to go through the bridge  versus the sewer  ivan combat  matt its hard to say a town full of people make an intelligence check  go ahead and roll a d20  ashly this is not going to go well  ivan roll for comedy  ashly one  matt natural one what  ashly ten ten altogether  matt ten altogether okay so you know humans you know them pretty well and theyre tall but  theyre pretty weak theres a lot of them on these bridges thats a lot of really 
none	 really weak  things conversely in the sewer who knows whats in there theres filth theres scavenging  pieces and possibly dirty humans so its up to you do you want to go out in a delightful goblin  blaze of glory or do you want to go out in a delightfully messy goblin blaze of glory  ashly the disembodied voice makes a good point lets go in the sewer  laughter  phil right lets drown rather than be stabbed  marisha how are we going to cross  ivan drowning is the way zarongel would want us 
none	 to go out  phil i thought you were going to build us some flotsamfloatyflotsam  marisha im really nervous about water i like burning things  ashly i can carry you im strong  taliesin i want to look around and see if theres anything to add to this flotsam pile  matt sure make a survival check  ivan can snizzler and mezek help me to  marisha build a rough raft  ivan yeah to build a rough raft  taliesin seven  marisha i roll as well  ivan 17  marisha what am i adding 
none	 here dont i have  good stuff for tinkering  ivan do you want to tinker i think this is survival  marisha oh survival ten but he rolled pretty good  matt okay it takes you guys the better part of about 30 minutes or so as you find things in the  nearby edge of the woods you start pulling up the bits of clay and sand that you were buried under  as something caught your foot and it was a bit pointy but you found a chunk of driftwood that looks  to have made its 
none	 way there i would like you all to make a stealth check as you are now having to  dart in and out of the forest to find material  ashly 18 plus 14  phil three plus 20  matt plus 20 goblins oh my god  taliesin 36 damn  marisha 32  ivan 33  matt okay you guys deftly running back and forth along the bank of river grabbing  what you can out of the sand and the dirt apparently entirely unnoticed as there even is a  series of guards that come by four 
none	 of them that just walk on past one of them you swear stared into  the forest right at you and went  marisha be garden gnomes you guys garden gnomes  matt hey steven did you leave some gnomes out here stupid gnomes  and they keep on walking past  marisha haha garden gnome act gets em every time heh heh heh  matt wait i want some garden gnomes and he comes back in nah they look filthy all green  from the mold stupid garden gnomes and he keeps going  ivan hes the first one 
none	 thats going to get pewpewed  marisha i agree boomboom heh  ivan boomboom pewpew  taliesin two arms two legs one head well find him at the end  ivan ive got his face ive got his beady face  matt so youve crafted this raft its less of a raft and more of a pool noodle buoy thing  ivan yes yes lets all get on a pool noodle which is basically a giant branch  phil thats the first smart thing youve said all day  matt this is less like tom hanks in castaway more gollum 
none	 in the river you guys are having to  hold on and move across however as you push it into the water it is buoyant and it does seem to  carry you the current does tend to push it so you guys are going to have to guide it across the  current if i could have you all make a swim check  marisha oh im so bad at this im really not the best swimmer you guys  ashly 11  marisha oh boy this is so bad  matt five  phil 12  taliesin 21 
none	  marisha four i have a fear of swimming  phil sorry 17  matt 17 okay so you guys are pushing along the three of you are back to back feels like goblin  power getting in there  phil oh i swallowed a fish cough  taliesin share share  matt you glance over your shoulder and see the two of them going yelling  ivan and marisha yelling  marisha i hate water  phil our fearless leaders  ashly that feels perfectly appropriate  matt as part of the screaming echoes out you hear someone in 
none	 the distance go  dyou hear that  ashly shut up shut up  ivan screams quietly  marisha hyperventilates quietly  matt okay you guys stop moving and the current carries you and you slowly begin to rotate in the  water and youre being rained on in the face and you see a couple guards look as you drift under  the bridge on the far left side of where you entered and they look down and go man theyll  throw away anything these days perfectly good piece of wood as it drifts under the bridge you 
none	  guys have a moment to go ahead and try and push to shore go ahead and roll swim checks again  marisha im so afraid  ivan better  taliesin 16  ivan 20  marisha negative one  matt haha its okay  phil what are you made of lead  marisha i have a negative four swim i just want to point that out cries  matt so as youre pushing there youre making headway except for the fact that snizzler is  going like yelling and pushing your heads under trying to climb out of the 
none	 water  ivan stop it stop stop it  ashly i say we kill her we cut our losses what am i right  phil lets just knock her out well need someone to carry all of her stuff  ashly i can carry it im strong  matt as the splashing and chaos hits you guys impact noise hit the sandbank on the other side  of the river you have managed to cross it primarily  marisha snizzler vomits as soon as he hits land vomit noises  taliesin i want to go through the vomit to see

none	 sand  taliesin i have a jug  matt puts it in the jug closes it off  taliesin ill go through it later  ivan being a goblin is amazing  matt at which point you hear another voice say did you hear laughing im going to go check  and you hear a number of footsteps coming your way  ivan im going to cast ghost sound  matt okay  ivan to see if i can distract them away  matt what kind of sound are you producing  ivan im going to produce a righteous merrimentmaking 
tavern	 sound  matt on the direction of  ivan it sounds like drunken storytelling  matt okay so at this point you guys watch as grizznak spins around points his staff forward  and quite a ways away you hear this boisterous indistinct drunk storytelling start blasting  from the opposite side of the bridge up near the rocks that begin to meet the base of  the citys foundation the footsteps shift and you hear them going across the wood planks above you  on the bridge in the direction that he set now is your time to go 
none	 ahead and dart for the  grate on the outside of the sewer go ahead and roll stealth checks all you guys  ivan stealth checks  taliesin thats leaning  ashly 23  matt 23  phil 40  matt jesus you vanish from time and space  taliesin he folds to be onedimensional  matt you have a fifthdimensional goblin on your team now  taliesin 31  marisha 19  ivan 22  matt okay you guys darting through the rain using the edge of the rocky  phil what took you so long  matt you

none	 the hammer in one hand grabs the grate spins it in place  sending rust and metal sparks and throws it behind her sploosh  ashly and i go like this  phil again i would like to mention about the being quiet part  ivan i take a moment to absorb all of that amazing that happened right there  ashly youre welcome youre welcome  ivan yeah grizznak not being the strongest of the bunch is easily swayed by intense feats of  strength oh my  phil grizznak you look like you want to grease her again 
none	 in a whole new way  ivan wishes he had another grease spell prepared woo okay  matt at which point you hear the howl of distant wind and the droplets of condensation within the  depths of this sewage system beckoning to you as an entry portal to this city secretly privately  and hopefully to wherever this festival is happening where you can gather this storm rock  ivan smells just like home  phil yes moldy and clammy  ivan yay hey do you remember when we were in juvie and they threw us down in the 
none	 lock box  for like a month  marisha oh dude and we got so blazed  ivan we got so blazed  marisha that was so good man  ivan yeah this reminds me of that  marisha yeah yeah i agree  ashly i feel excluded  laughter  ashly remember when i ripped the grate off of the thing  phil oh those were the days  taliesin when did that happen i dont remember that  ivan i think were all going to want to sneak  phil lets go inside  ivan sneak around inside 
none	  taliesin i want to keep my eyes peeled for things that might be useful or that can contain alcohol  matt okay good to know you guys step your way inside the sewer the slick stone structure of it  has lots of residue buildup from various minerals that have come through as well as various degrees  of wastewater that have found their way to the river the smell is horrible for anyone but you  guys its a familiar scent as you make your way inside id say about 100 feet in as youre going  through 
dung	 the darkness here but you guys can see fine in the dark this is goblin speciality  ivan darkvision guys  phil i check to see if there are any insects that are tastylooking  matt go ahead and make a perception check  phil 21  matt all right glancing about you do see a cluster of some sort of an egg sac that is pushed  up into the corner along the curved rotation of this duct its roughly the size of a large melon and  it twitches  ivan i will burn it with flare  
none	 marisha yeah  ashly dont burn it were going to eat it  matt as youre looking up at it fwoosh it bursts into flames  ashly what the heck  phil who burns food  ivan roasted spiders are best spiders see you guys arent smart so you dont know that burning  spiders makes them that much tastier  ashly are there spiders left to eat  matt you go and glance and the slight tiny series of squeaks you hear as the hundreds of tiny spider  young have burned to their end there is a nice 
none	 waft of cooked scent that hits your nose and the  rumbling in your tummy takes over as you guys all leap in at once grabbing small chunks of what you can  marisha this is the best when its crispy on the outside but gooey on the inside  phil i wish there was tartar sauce  taliesin oh wait i open up the jar  horrified laughter  taliesin smear some on his spider chunk  phil close enough  ivan did you season our birds spider egglettes with vomit  ashly dont knock it this is the 
none	 good shit  ivan i burned it for you  taliesin i won it fair and square  ivan im going to cast arcane mark on the side of this wall and mark that we were here  particularly grizznak the greatest was here is what im going to mark but it really looks like a  giant butt with like a cloud  taliesin i was about to say can you read and write  phil no words  ivan no no words the symbol for grizznak the greatest is a goblin with two cheeky farts and a  
none	 cloud coming out of it  taliesin i was imagining a goblin dickbutt  laughter  ivan that is the mark of grizznak the great  phil a goblin dick looks like a human dick but with spurs  taliesin oh god oh thank you thank you  matt we learned a very valuable lesson this evening  ivan of goblin physiology  phil thats how you know its love  taliesin no  matt tumblr get on that  taliesin oh god too late moving on  phil i cant unsee it in my mind  taliesin you wont 
none	 have to youll go on the internet in about an hour and itll be there theres nothing  that can be done anymore  matt you did this phil you did this  taliesin were not kidding were not even kidding a little  ivan oh all right grizznak the great has left his arcane mark a goblin dickbutt  matt progressing forward for the next couple hundred feet into this slick sewer making your  way along embankments where bits of clutter broken sticks chunks of wayward stone and mortar  pieces that have washed down here have built 
none	 these small halfwalls of junk that have mucked up the side  marisha snizzler takes a firecracker that he has and secretly lights it and throws it behind him  real fast without telling anybody  matt okay you guys walk forward until explosion you all glance over your shoulder real fast  taliesin i attack  laughter  matt go ahead and roll an attack  taliesin thank you  ivan i attack the darkness  laughter  taliesin 14  matt 14 okay you turn around real fast as a piece of rock that is set loose from 
none	 this small  firecracker explosion whips through the air and you punch it with your fist  go ahead and roll damage  ivan i forgot hes a goblin monk he punches things  taliesin thats five  matt with that you turn this piece of mildewed slimy sewageencrusted stone to dust as it poof  in front of you holding your fist as it shakes there quivering your eyes open any buzz you may  have carried from your morning alcohol has waned for now and you are far more awake and conscious  with a mild headache  
none	 ivan guys were into this campaign and so far the only thing weve defeated is a rock this is  the best goblin campaign  laughter  matt the path does split here now and divides to the right and left  ashly can i roll perception  matt to see  ashly if theres anything different about them  matt sure go for it  ashly 17 plus four is 21  matt piglet youre the instinctual tracker most goblins hunt with traps you hunt with teeth  ashly nice  matt so you get down and sniffing begin 
none	 getting into the muck and pushing it aside less than a  visual perspective here you can smell that the bulk of the waste that comes through here comes  from the left path that probably means more waste means more people  ivan more waste more people  phil so we should go away from the people  ashly wait what are we doing  marisha yeah why are we here  ivan get the blue stone  ashly a rock the rock  taliesin the cracked man with the blue stone  ashly zachary thats the guy right 
none	  phil hes in blue hes got a rock  ivan i remember hes in a birch like a birch tree right birch  taliesin no a church tree  ivan a church tree thats right  marisha and we stay under trees when theres lightning thats what youre thinking of  ivan right thats right because zarongel likes to smite trees  phil do we go to the poop or away from the poop  all to the poop  ivan to the poop so we go down the left channel  matt all right so you guys laughs 
none	 you charge forward here  ashly wait just to clarify because i used my teeth does that mean i ate  poop to find the tunnel  phil well i hope you saved some for the rest of us  matt no you had to smear it on your teeth a little pushing forward you guys travel another  80 or so feet before you come onto a large series of waterfalls that run into a central open cesspool  area that is down below this path the actual path diverts and goes around this central tunnel before  it 
none	 continues in a singular direction as the water is pouring in  phil what do we see above  matt make a perception check  ivan can i look as well  phil 25  ivan 12  matt okay you look down into the cesspool and hock a loogie to see how far it goes down  splash noise  ivan 25 feet  taliesin those are not supposed to be solid  phil and deep too what no  matt you glance up and you can see there is some sort of a large heavy grating that most 
none	 of the  water is pouring down from youre not quite looks like a lot of the rainwater runoff from the  city itself however you do notice a glimmer from what little bit of light that is bouncing through  from the surface and your goblin eyes catch this little glimmer in the corner and you glance over  and instinctually run towards it you go ahead and take a look  phil its shiny  matt you find a hefty wellmade human shortsword  phil dibs  ivan so its a broadsword for you  phil are you 
none	 saying im small  ivan im saying were all small  phil oh right  matt what did you roll what was the total on your perception check again  phil 25  matt 25 you take this and the blade is  perfectly clean this place is filthy this blade  is perfectly clean and as you glance over underneath the waterfall you see another glimmer  phil ooh i run and go over there i carry the sword with me i dont trust these two  taliesin i see that he is im approaching cautiously  ashly i 
none	 want to push everyone else away and get there first  phil hey wait you cant even see it can you  matt both of you guys make initiative checks right now  ashly 11  phil four  taliesin wait you got plus six  phil ten  ashly oh wait 15  matt so as you see this and you glance over out of the corner of your eye you see piglet her  eyes go wide and both of you have that immediate knowledge of me first you both dart off around  two different sides of 
none	 this cistern and starting to get there however piglet you get there first  and immediately leap towards this shiny and the shiny is bigger than you expected  ivan can i cast mage hand to see if i can snatch it from all three of them or  away from the two of them  matt is it a fivepound maximum  ivan five pounds yeah  matt you go ahead and cast mage hand towards that shiny and pull and grunts its a little heavier  than you can pull you get there and you grab on to 
none	 it what you notice as you get there is a set  a full set of a breastplate armor human size giant breastplate with some shoulder pauldrons and  a human ribcage on the inside of this breastplate  ashly ooh ribcage  matt you smell it marrow hasnt been tapped yet  ashly can i eat it  matt you can  ashly i eat it  phil barbeque  ashly can i wear the armor is it too big for me  matt its pretty big yeah you could sleep in it  phil rent it out  
none	 matt so you grab the ribcage break off a couple ribs start gnawing on them sucking the marrow  out you do notice getting there and inspecting the ribcage is white it is clean as well you can  see upon close look as she is gnawing not even paying attention you see these little teeth marks  on it like rats have come through here and there overall the bone is perfectly clean the armor  itself is spotless looks like its been perfectly polished  ashly this marrows real good you guys are missing out  marisha pass 
none	 me a rib  phil is there any of the armor that any of us can fit  matt you could try and pull scrap from it if you wanted to try and scavenge pieces of the metal  taliesin if we pulled the two shoulder pieces off could we maybe tie them together and wear  them like an eat at joes sign  matt could certainly try that if you want to yes  taliesin im going to give it a roll  matt okay i will say for this you know what go ahead and make a 
none	 survival check  on this to try and  taliesin thats funny no im down 12  matt 12 you manage to grunt for a minute with some help from a couple other of the goblins pull  one of the pauldrons off you take it and  phil dont choke yourself  matt based on your combat aesthetic its not going to be much of a help to you  ivan this is i never thought i would hear a goblin character say this but i can spellcraft to  check to see if its magical at all  
none	 matt sure the armor  ivan the armor  matt yeah go for it  ivan i almost want to kick it into the cistern to get it dirty im sorry i dont know why i  rolled because im doing spellcraft yes thats right 19  matt the armor itself does not appear to have a magical essence to it in fact a close look  its pretty close to the design of armor the guards were wearing on the actual bridge itself  its just completely polished down here in the middle of a dank sewer  ashly 
none	 does the armor help any of the rest of us the goblincrafted  taliesin im going to throw it at piglet just throw it at you  matt its delightful decoration  ashly oh ho ho ho ho  ivan are you woody woodpecker now i think something killed  phil i think something is down here cleaning weve got to get out of here  before it comes back  ivan i dont want whatever cleaned this armor to clean off grizznak the greats fine robes  phil itll take the farts right out of you  ivan is 
none	 there any way to climb up to the grate  matt its about 40 feet up from you guys the path continues across the cistern  deeper into the city  marisha we didnt think about having to crawl back out  matt beyond the cistern the tunnel continues after it converges  phil just keep going  matt whos leading this expedition now  phil i think im more qualified to lead but i dont like to be in front  ashly i have the prettiest hat  phil piglet i nominate you  ashly hooray  matt piglet 
none	 go ahead and roll perception  ashly singing i forget where my perception is every time there it is 19  matt 19 okay all righty so as you go as you put your new shiny hat on and begin stepping  forward across where the paths converge you big knees forward stomping steps and you put  your head forward and stop as theres a distortion in the air before you and you breathe out huh  and it wobbling noise quivers  ivan step aside step aside grizznak the great is here  phil great lets get ready 
none	 to be hit by lightning  ivan well it looks like something wobbly so its probably magic  matt you make a perception check  ivan im going to percept the shit out of this  marisha probably magic  ivan probably magic 14  matt 14 you pull her aside theres nothing visible in the air before you youre wondering  why she stopped and as you step forward you hit something at which point you guys watch as you  suddenly notice there is a large cubelike creature made of some quivering gelatinous  material as grizznak is 
none	 slowly being pulled into it  ivan no  matt everyone roll initiative  ivan guys guys guys  taliesin thats how we do it you did very well in that add your initiative  marisha oh you found a waterbed aw how cool man  oh gelatinous cube  ivan can i get my hands together at all or are my hands  matt you can certainly try here well see how this works out for you all right so initiative  rolls here oh man all right all right so initiative orders we have 20 to 15  
none	 taliesin 21  phil 25  marisha 15  ashly im 19  ivan 12  matt whatd you get  marisha 15  ivan grizznak is the best  matt grizznak what did you roll  ivan 12  taliesin thats how long thats how long it took are you happy now are you happy  ashly laughs oh oh no im worried for dickbutt  marisha see if you will it it will happen  matt it will happen every time  marisha havent you heard of the story of the little boy with the magical paintbrush  
none	 matt all right so as you watch grizznak sucked into this giant creature you see it  shifting and squelching sounds top of the round is browntooth browntooth what do you want to do  on your turn  phil suppose i have to attack it  ivan pull me out pull me out  phil can i attack him or can i kill it all right i hit it with my cleaver  matt all right go ahead and roll for attack  phil 16 do i add anything  taliesin yeah 16 plus  phil yes 16 plus 
none	 ten  matt that hits go ahead and roll damage  so you move up there you can move five feet and do your second attack if you  want to youre close enough that you can attack with both  phil oh great two  taliesin plus one  phil plus one three and do i do another one  taliesin no and then you have to do it for the other hand which is different so you have to  roll again to hit for the second one  matt so whats the damage on the first one 
none	  phil three  matt three damage all right  taliesin and then thats plus  phil five plus plus eight 13  matt 13 does hit it has a very low armor class because it is a giant cube  so go ahead and roll damage  phil four  matt nice all right so as you rush forward taking your fivefoot step and attack with your  first goblin cleaver you slice through part of its form then slice through with your second one  as you cut each time you can see it leaves a giant opening 
none	 and you cut a wedge out that  slurping noise slops onto the ground and turns into a slowly liquefying piece of water the section that  you cut out begins to slowly reform but however it does lose the mass that you cut of it so it  appears to be having some sort of impact that finishes your turn browntooth mezek youre up  taliesin all right im going to  matt however actually real fast cause this is part of the fun of it nope actually youre  good youre up mezek sorry keeping track of the 
dung	 rules for the creature i havent used  gelatinous cube in so long  ivan i was waiting to hear and grizznak you were eaten  laughter  matt technically you were  taliesin im going to take a deep breath screams  ashly here he goes again  taliesin and hit it with a stunning fist  matt okay go ahead and roll for the attack  marisha he named it himself  phil and your eyes are lovely  taliesin one of thems mine 16  matt 16 hits go ahead and roll damage for the fist

none	  taliesin im going to take a step back and pull out my quarterstaff now that ive had my turn  matt okay so you step back it does get an attack of opportunity as you move back its giant  pseudopod shoots out towards you  ivan it wants to stunning fist you  matt thats a 12 whats your armor class  taliesin touch ac or armor class  matt no this is a general one  taliesin 18  matt 18 yeah as it whoosh out towards you you duck low with your quick goblin reflexes  
none	 awesome that ends your turn piglet what do you want to do  ashly i want to rage  matt okay  laughter  matt you go into a full goblin piglet rage grabbing your oversized goblin skullbreaker  hammer go ahead and roll your attack  ivan ive always wanted to hear a goblin say that  ashly oh okay so it was 20 plus seven  matt 20 plus seven that hits go ahead and roll damage  ashly wheres a d10 am i crazy  taliesin do you need a d10 here  matt also grizznak i 
none	 need you to roll a constitution save sorry a constitution base  saving throw fortitude save  ashly so this is a d10 plus four oh thats a pretty one eight plus four times three is that  what that is or  matt well no it should say your second attack down is during raging  ashly oh im sorry okay oh okay so its eight plus six then  matt all right there you go 14 points of damage as your hammer comes down wham hitting it  stopping an inch from the edge of grizznaks face as 
none	 he turns and watches from inside the whole  thing shakes from the impact  ashly do i also get to bite because im raging  matt you do  phil ew lucky you  ivan i have so many feelings right now some of them are wobbling  ashly 19  matt 19 that hits again go ahead and roll for your bite damage as you go in and bite a chunk  out of this giant gelatinous mass like its dessert  ashly d3  matt yeah so roll a d6 and divide by two  ashly okay 
none	 boop so its a three  taliesin that would be two  matt yeah so that would be two two plus  ashly plus three  matt two plus three so you do five points of damage giant goblin maw bites into the side once  again near grizznaks face  phil shes raging she doesnt know where she is  matt as you pull a bit away immediately as you pull back the rage is in you you dont really  notice the fact that your mouth has gone tingling and youve lost all sensation in your mouth  
none	 ashly oh no  marisha hey piglet hows the jello monster  ashly delicious  matt as you blah drools out as she talks her lips are numb its like blah blah blah  laughter  matt it dribbles down the front of her body yeah your tongue and mouth arent moving like  they should youre a goblin that got out of the dentist right now because you took a bite out of it  marisha the novocaine cube  ashly novocaine cube thats awesome  matt grizznak did you roll your fortitude save  ivan my fortitude save 
none	 no i havent oh god fortitude save 11  matt 11 okay  ivan question mark  matt okay you are currently paralyzed for eight rounds  marisha and ashly what  matt being engulfed by this entity its actually caused all of your muscles to lock up and you  feel that same tingling sensation as you glance over and all the little hairs that might be  protruding on your body dissolve and part of your skin begins to peel away  ivan i still have the last look that i had which is this stupid face of 
none	 awe and wonder of piglet  raging and thats all thats on my face right now as im paralyzed inside of the cube  matt all right so finishing piglets turn that comes to you snizzler what are you going to do  marisha does he have any limbs or anything that are sticking out still that are accessible  matt no no he is fully engulfed by the entity right now  ashly oh shit  marisha where am i on the map  matt you are right there by the way this is the opening this drops down 
none	 about 20 feet and the  water is pouring into that right behind you so be careful where youre stepping  marisha oh thats good to know okay snizzler runs up takes out a pipe bomb clicking noise  can i shove the pipe bomb in the jello  matt you can if you want to  marisha is it going to start sucking me in when i do that  taliesin shushes go with it go with it  matt you want to go with it so you take a step forward you  marisha i want to find 
none	 the hole piglet made and aim for that  matt okay so youre going to step into there  marisha and grunts explosive bomb  matt so you watch as this haphazard piece of metal shrapnel thats been matted together with  pig feces and twine goes sticking noise and is now right in front of you as you see a little fuse  going sizzling  ivan i cant scream because im paralyzed but inside im screaming im screaming very loudly  marisha and i look at grizz and i go  matt are you going to stay right 
none	 there  marisha and i take a few steps back not into the hole  matt so it would probably be one two three well put you there as you do that and pull back  another giant pseudopod goes whoosh out towards you and slams into the stone next to you but you  go huh thats the least of your worries right now  marisha hang on one second man  matt as you pull back theres an explosion sound as it bursts inside the cube so i want you to go  ahead and roll for an 
none	 attack on this just for the purposes of this  marisha sorry grizz 18  matt 18 so yeah this is a direct hit on the creature so go ahead and do your firebomb damage  to the cube  ivan oh how much damage is it  marisha aw it went into my soy sauce but im going to take it because it was a six  laughter  marisha ten plus three plus another d4  phil thats what you call  phil and taliesin a salt with a deadly weapon  marisha so 15 points of damage 
none	  matt 15 points of fire damage as it bursts on the inside you are paralyzed cannot make a reflex  saving throw you take six points of fire damage from being in the blast radius of this thing  marisha i was going to say i do want to do an explosive bomb so direct hits catch fire dealing  an additional 1d6 fire damage every round  matt oh good to know so the actual cube is also on fire due to the blast radius because of the  size of your explosion too because it is the 
none	 tenfoot i need both of you guys to roll reflex  saving throws if you could  ashly i think its a 20  matt yep d20 and add your reflex save  ashly 17  phil 16  matt 16 its half damage right for that so both of you take three points of fire damage as  the blast radius of this sends chunks of this creature sticking to the ceiling and slopping down  phil i have evasion  matt you take none because youre a rogue  ivan have i at least been blown out of 
none	 the cube or am i still inside of the cube  matt youre like partially out of it right now with the blast radius but  ivan so slightly exposed  matt youre slightly exposed its partially exposed and as youre there going muffled  screaming it sucking noise muffled screaming closing around you slowly all right that  finishes your turn now it is your turn you take two points of acid damage as it begins to slowly  digest you from the inside  ivan so guys i will probably not last another couple of rounds just to 
none	 be clear so  taliesin working on it  ivan the skin is starting but beyond just the burning oh god the burning there is you can  see as most of grizznaks robes have been dissolved into nothingness and part of his goblin  face is starting to peel off revealing my immensely beautiful crooked teeth so yeah  taliesin if my parents taught me anything its that a burning sensation is nothing to worry  about youre good youre good  matt all right so as you two are there right in front of it the thing begins 
none	 reforming the front  of it which is currently blown open from the bomb that snizzler left in there it begins to shift  and slither towards both of you guys and intending to engulf you as well i need you both to go ahead  and make reflex saving throws  marisha oh man  ashly no i got seven do i get to know what the result would be before i use my song  ivan you just get to reroll  matt you dont know what the result is but do you want to use your song

none	 like i can die what  what are you going to do  ashly i decide no im going to live forever and ill sing my song  matt all right go for it whats your song  ashly okay im going to try a thing i dont know if its going to work  matt all right  ashly im going to try to sing my song to the tune of kiss from a rose because thats my goto  taliesin youre my favorite oh god  ashly lets see sings piglet twitchy scratch the rash until she sees

none	 goblin song maybe  missed a few vowels because of the blahlah but the rest of your body begins to tingle and you  begin to fight against it and your body wont move  marisha no  matt your bodys paralyzed for six rounds  phil only six  matt jammed up against however it does take another d6 points of fire damage from your bomb so  go ahead and roll that if you could  marisha four  matt four points of fire damage all righty all right that brings us back to the top browntooth  
none	 youre up you dodge to the side you see it engulf  phil is it moving away from me  matt it is it moved this way and you sidestep and its moving parallel to you  phil okay i would like to get behind it and shoot my crossbow  matt okay so you move  phil because ive decided i dont want any more handtohand combat seems like a bad idea  matt a pseudopod swings out towards you but you it misses you entirely as you dart backward with  your crossbow loaded you take aim and 
none	 go ahead and fire  phil this one right fuck seven plus nine 16  matt youve heard the term couldnt hit the broad side of a barn thankfully this creature  is the size of a barn you manage to sink the bolt into it go ahead and roll damage you feel a  slight bit of pain at your back as a bolt nips you in the butt but you cant do anything about it  because youre paralyzed five points of damage all right you guys can see the creatures shaking  and shimmering as its moving

none	 person that once wore it bits of them are  floating inside as it begins to collapse on itself like an order of cold flan and as it  liquefies part of it pouring into the cistern the two of their bodies are starting to be pulled  into the cistern with its form unable to keep shape  ashly help help help  taliesin i run in and grab them  marisha yeah i help as well oh grizz  matt okay you guys grab them pull them out onto the side the last bit of the flaming corpse 
none	 of  this cube sloshes into the cistern you wait about another minute or so before you both get your  bodies back  marisha i take a little goo out of his ear and i ah yeah its got a little kick there yeah  youre right  ivan i take my nose and go and i watch as goo goes wet noise out of my ears  ashly is this what being greased feels like because i dont like it  taliesin its not easy  ashly phil and taliesin being greased  matt so as youre resting 
none	 up from this do you guys need to do anything to heal up a bit  ivan if we had things in which to heal up with but as of course  marisha do we get any healing surges or anything like that  matt no this is pathfinder girl  ivan this is not like fourth edition i dont think we have anything because i certainly didnt  take it and we have no real  taliesin i have the healing skill can we try and use the healing skill to reset things  matt sure ill let you 
none	 do that being the monk that you are  phil when they say it couldnt hurt im not sure theyre right  taliesin 20  matt 20 and with that with the various burn wounds on your body from the acid thats burned  away and parts of the actual burn damage youve taken from the explosion mezek rushes in and like  the roughest masseuse youve ever seen  ivan its like the best shiatsu massage ive ever gotten  taliesin let go let go youre holding a lot of tension  ivan ugh thats good that one right 
none	 there that knot especially  phil dont forget to breathe  matt id say for that go ahead and heal four points due to the rhythmic massage of mezeks  rough and tumble goblin hands  ivan i would like to point out that you just healed me through a goblin shiatsu massage  that was amazing  matt yes yep that happened  taliesin with vomitbased massage oil its organic  ashly only the finest for you  ivan i step up and i crack my back a little bit and okay were good to go lets do this 
none	  taliesin do any of my flasks or jugs have any liquor in them  matt no however make a perception check  ashly i also have a jug i dont know whats in it  taliesin 20  matt 20 you have a jug its mainly sloshing water and grime your usual what you like to sip  on the way of your journey whatever you find along the way you guys are into this whole  scavenging thing as youre thinking about this ah you didnt bring any alcohol  you smell alcohol  taliesin sniffs happy juice 
none	 happy juice  matt all of a sudden you guys watch as mezek darts down the path  ivan follow him he found booze which means when theres booze theres stuff and a happy mezek  marisha yeah i like that  matt as you dart ahead you come to the edge and you can see there the path continues for another  200 feet before it dips off but you dont know quite where but the scent is strong here and you  look over and you can see the wall to your immediate right actually has a fissure 
dung	 in it a  part of it has cracked or a part of it has semieroded away and you can see the very distant  dark glimmer of something beyond it  taliesin i stick my hand in and go for it  matt go ahead and make a strength check  taliesin thats not funny eight  matt eight you go and grab the stone you lift your whole goblin body up on it and start pulling you  guys catch up and see mezek fighting with this wall and making no headway whatsoever  taliesin piglet piglet  
none	 ashly okay let me smash this with the hammer  ivan i was going to say im going to grab mezeks waist and help him pull so that were just  two goblins pulling on it now  matt laughs okay so you guys are just like doublepulling on it you make a strength check  as well go ahead and roll an attack against the wall  marisha is mezek getting in a fight with a wall again  ivan he does this just humor him  phil he usually loses  ashly 17 is this plus strength  
none	 taliesin plus strength modifier  matt well go ahead and roll damage because you hit the wall outside of a critical fail  youre fine  ashly so should i do my normal  matt yes a normal d10 plus youre not raging so that would be a plus four  ashly five  matt five points of damage as you guys are pulling the hammer comes down as piglet smashes  into the side of this wall the stones crumble inward and you both go flung forward into the darkness  tumbling over each other before you both impact 
tavern	 noise against the wall slowly slide down as you  look around youre inside this darkened chamber glancing around you first off you immediately  notice that there is a heavy smell of alcohol in this room  ivan were in one of those humans call them a tavern or one  marisha this is one of those cellar cellar  ivan its yeah its where they do their fighting at its basically where humans go to  beat up each other its a goblin pit  taliesin sounds like heaven  ivan its amazing  ashly ive heard they 
none	 also pick up chicks whatever that means  taliesin baby chickens  ashly loudly there are chickens here its like a hooer house right  phil do they eat owls too chickens and owls im getting hungry  taliesin baby owls  matt which as you guys are getting hungry you look around this chamber youre in you see a sack  of moldy grains small containers of salts and spices dried meats that are put on racks against the wall  casks and bottles of wine and ale all throughout this  taliesin done ale done going for the 
none	 ale  ivan we forgot about our mission for as long as it takes for us to eat everything in this cellar  matt you guys go nuts devouring everything grabbing at meat filling your bellies youd  be welcome to fill your jugs with alcohol  taliesin im filling my flask and my waterskin  matt do you clear out your jug first or are you just going to add to it  taliesin no im just going to add it  matt all right cool  ivan does this help me at all with my current hit point 
none	 situation  marisha eat up maybe  matt for the circumstances here you heal one hit point from the food  taliesin we all heal one  ivan but yeah i will eat it all if anything it will allow me to feel better  matt i will say if you want to go ahead and tear into that moldy grain that might heal you a  little more but it looks like your stomach might have a rough time with it  do you want to go for it  taliesin maybe you have to have a chat with 
none	 a spirit animal  ivan im a god damn goblin  taliesin nothing bad happens when you eat moldy grain  matt you get on top of that moldy grain you tear into it you destroy it  ivan im going to at one point im going to take one of the pots and im going to scoop it and im  going to pour it over my head because i know that moldy grain has healing properties and as i put  it into my mouth im going to rub it all over my burning sores  phil i 
none	 call you grizznak the glutinous  laughter  taliesin im imagining orson welles at the end of apocalypse now right now with the towel  ivan also arcane mark on the cellar wall goblin dickbutt grizznak the great has been here  matt as you go ahead and focus over on the wall you hear this rumbling in your stomach go ahead  and roll a fortitude saving throw  ivan yeah im really good at fortitude saves why cant i do will saves ever fortitude  saves shit  phil cackles literally  ivan eight  matt well the 
none	 good news is you heal three additional hit points as your goblin metabolism  takes in the horrible moldy grain the downside is you then vomit up all the moldy grain and you  lose the hit points  ashly im going to get rid of the wine and put that all in my jug  matt okay  ivan i feel great until i vomit it back up again  ashly i had all the wine in my jug and i got rid of it and filled it with vomit  phil id like to secretly pocket some of 
none	 the dried meats to take with me  matt secretly so nobody else sees it or  phil no they dont see it  matt make a sleightofhand check  taliesin i like a man with secrets oh my  ashly he just shoved an entire cow down his pants  phil 32  taliesin he rolled a tell him what you rolled  phil i rolled a natural 20 with a plus 12 sleightofhand  matt laughs as everyone else is marveling themselves at this display of goblin gluttony you  step backwards and somehow in the process of 
none	 giving your fellow goblins a little bit of a head  nod you have managed to fill all of your pouches and pockets with every single piece of meat on  that wall it goes from full to empty in a second and no ones the wiser you got like saddle bags  filled with food right now and no one seems to have noticed  ivan browntooth youre looking very fit  phil well i work out  marisha youre very curvy  ivan so curvy  marisha and youve got a little junk in the trunk looks good 
none	  phil yeah yknow comes from my mothers side  marisha ah sure yeah your mom man  matt as you guys are finishing this mountain of goblin gluttony were going to go ahead and take  a quick break here well be back here in a few minutes  marisha dont let me forget i want to try and find some wine bottles for molotov cocktails  dont let me forget  matt all right well be right back  break  matt welcome back so weve had a little break here were coming back into the chaos here 
town	 so  this goblin band having taken root in this storage basement beneath this human barn the  center of the town of sandpoint youve  marisha oh wait i want to make sure i find some wine bottles maybe i can make some molotov  cocktails real quick maybe  matt okay you gather a couple of bottles of wine you not really being able to read the  labels gather what seems to be alcoholic and functional  marisha looks expensive  taliesin looks like molotov  marisha yeah  matt all right while this is happening does 
none	 anyone want to do anything else here  ivan i want to roll in the discarded grain that i then threw up to give me temporary hit points and  i want to roll in it  matt okay you roll around in it and you feel like itll give you sufficient protection against  a light wind  marisha like a dog rolling in his vomit  ivan yes exactly thats exactly how its going down  matt you can hear the footsteps and what sounds like voices from upstairs there is a ladder in  the far edge 
tavern	 of this room that leads up to a trap door and when the trap door is closed you can  hear what sounds like the occasional chuckle voices that are muffled through the wood it  appears that there is an actual tavern above you on street level that has a handful of patrons in it  ivan so do we escape through the tavern or do we go back into the caves and see if we can get under  the godly poopoo place  ashly can i roll a perception to see if theres any other way out 
tavern	 apart from the place with all  the humans and the place we just came from  matt sure  ashly thats not great its a ten  matt ten i mean theres the path you can keep going or theres the tavern  ashly oh right we can keep going  ivan we can keep going to find the birch tree  phil church  ivan which is where the church right the birch  matt which as a note you guys currently have no idea where in this city you are youre just in  the sewers  
none	 ivan this is fine this is part of the plan dont even worry about it or we could just run  out into the streets goblins  phil that sounds decidedly unstealthy i say we keep going down until we find poop that seems like  its from a blue man  marisha i like that yeah for the blue poop  ivan browntooth lets go find the blue poop  marisha lets find the blue poop onward  ivan so were going to crawl back out through the hole that we made  marisha maybe theres more cellars like 
none	 this too  matt okay  phil more food  matt you guys climb outside of the section of the broken wall and continue down the path  ivan as we leave i would like to leave a parting flare into the cellar because burning  matt chuckles okay  ivan because burning as i leave im like on my way out  matt okay you see the flare begin to slowly cause an ember to burn at the edge of a burlap  sack of some spices in the corner  marisha good one  ivan yeah woo  
none	 matt all right you guys continue to walk down this pathway in the sewage system for about  another 100 or so 150 feet it slowly pinches into about a fivefootwide tunnel you guys can  stand shouldertoshoulder two at a time at your goblin size to get across and the little bit of  water that is coming through here from the rain runoff from some of the upper grate areas that are  pouring in it seems to be running to the edge and you stumble a ways ahead before you find out  that there that dropoff 
none	 that you noticed you come up to it and it is indeed a dropoff you  glance down and the walkway youre at ends abruptly around a large cylindrical cisterntype  chamber probably a good 80 feet across and about 80 feet down further than your vision can really  see you dont see a bottom of it you see water falling  ivan what does the loogie tell me  matt you spit out the loogie make a perception check  ivan loogie perception check  marisha were all rolling terrible tonight  matt you get so caught up 
none	 with the flow of the loogie that you keep leaning forward further and  further trying to figure it out as your heels lift up  ivan woo  matt you guys watch as grizznak suddenly tips forward and goes over the edge  ashly well hes dead  ivan is anyone going to catch me because im going to sing my song  ashly i can try to catch you what would that be or would it be acrobatics  matt this would be a straight up i would say dexterity go ahead and roll a dexterity check on 
none	  this one to see if you can be fast enough to grab  taliesin ill join her in it  marisha ill join well make goblin  phil this is the last time i save your ass  ashly seven  marisha goblin chain were going to goblin chain this everyone loop together  phil 21  taliesin 13  matt oh youre not helping youre watching  marisha no im goblin chaining this with them straight dexterity 20 total  matt 20 okay piglet reaches forward and goes over too  ashly oh god my hubris  matt 
none	 as they both begin to tumble over the edge you grab and you both slip forward the three of  you manage to grab the back of piglet and pull her up and slowly you guys get back up into the  tunnel no no no piglet managed to grab the very back of grizznak and pull him back up  marisha damn guys were badasses just like we practiced good work  matt grizznak youre really frustrated because you swear you were this close to seeing when that  thing would drop before you got pulled up  ivan 
none	 guys whats the big deal i was almost there i almost saw it oh hi  phil no more saving you  ashly i have an alternate plan what if i throw one of you across to the other side  phil hmm i have another alternate alternate plan i look to see if there is any way to climb up  matt okay make a perception check  phil math is killing me 24  matt you glance upon the sides of the stonework on the inside of this giant cylindrical cistern  that leads up to the where 
none	 all the waters pouring in from glancing about there are very very  sparsely set stones that are slightly more protruding than the rest you gather they could be  leapt from stone to stone if one is so interested in being a good climber so there is a way yeah  ashly goblin toss that other thing that sounds way boring goblin toss boring  taliesin i volunteer as tribute  ashly yeah you want me to toss you  taliesin i tie the rope to my waist and i tie the rope to her  phil all the 
none	 way across  ashly all the way across  taliesin i have 50 feet of rope  matt mezek ties the rope around who gets the other end of the rope  taliesin give it to piglet  matt okay piglet you have one side of the rope now  ashly im going to start swinging him around  matt okay because there isnt a lot of roll a strength check  taliesin i approve of this plan on every level  ashly 12  matt 12 so you swing him around once before you realize that because youre up 
none	 against a wall  theres not a whole lot of space and impact into the stonework you take one point of bludgeoning  damage hitting the side as he slips down and then is now dangling and you can pull him back up  taliesin all right toss  matt theres a big gap in mezeks grin as a tooth is now missing from that  ashly it looks good it suits you  taliesin it was hurting already  phil more space to eat  taliesin yeah strawholder all right  ashly all right well thats all my plans 
none	  phil youre not going to throw him across  ashly oh wait i could toss him across is there something on the other side did i make that up  is there more path  matt looking across the way you can see there is another opening 80 feet across  ashly shall i try to toss him  taliesin well i only have 50 feet of rope that would have gone poorly  matt you can try  ashly do you still volunteer as tribute  marisha i volunteer  ashly you volunteer  marisha i think i 
none	 have a plan it only works for me though but fuck you guys  ashly all right im going to toss you  marisha wait first i take out a bottle and i drink it and i shrink i take my reduce person vial  matt extract okay what is normalsized snizzler shrinks down to about half the size now voice is  higher appearance is ridiculous you guys now all cant help but chuckle at this  marisha okay are you ready to throw me lets try this  ashly youre so dumb  marisha what are you guys 
none	 laughing at what dont garble  ashly youre small youre comparatively smaller to us now  ivan i take her little tiny arms and i start making her dance like a little doll  marisha stop it  ivan my names snizzler snizzler snizzler snizzler i like to fly i like to fly  marisha mom mom  matt snizzler you immediately regret this decision  ashly all right now im going to toss you okay  ivan im going to just for shits and giggles im going to also cast breeze  ashly and marisha 20  matt a 
none	 natural 20  ashly 23 all together  taliesin its the golden snitch man dont fuck with the golden snitch  matt so you take this tiny goblin lick your grimy finger feel the wind point sir ruth style  and shotput snizzler arcs forward much farther than you expected overward you see in the  distance rope not attached by the way  marisha you guys its beautiful from up here  matt over it comes up and you can see you may or may not be close enough to the ledge oh god  its right there before 
none	 you go ahead and make an acrobatics check in the middle of the air to try  and maneuver yourself in the air to catch  marisha hang on wait she rolled the golden snitch let me roll my golden not not  taliesin i was about to say that golden snitch never rolls well though  marisha it never rolls well wait this is just a dexterity  ivan acrobatics  marisha 12  matt 12  ashly oh no wait is it song time is it song time  ivan song time sing your song  marisha what 
none	 am i falling now  matt its up to you if you want to let it go you can sing your song and go for a reroll  marisha i guess its song time as im still soaring in my tiny voice i say sing snizzler  zazzlers sizzler zaz eyebrows this goblin once had my bombs go boom they never miss hi  homeland security because now im on the watchlist  taliesin its funny because its true  marisha yes yes it is  matt go ahead and reroll that acrobatics check  phil dont use that die 
none	  marisha ill use this one  ivan got to get better got to get  ashly did it get worse what is with the rerolling  marisha ten  matt so piglet you had this this isnt your fault stupid bomb goblin cant catch a ledge but  you like you cross your arms and look around just so everyone else understands that it wasnt you  ivan good try piglet  matt splashing into the water below  marisha i hate water  phil she really does  ashly hey he didnt die  matt i do need 
none	 you to make a swim check  marisha im fucking terrible at swimming oh god okay well i rolled a 14 and i have a minus four  to my swim so ten  matt so youre treading water and slowly making your way across this giant cistern about 20 feet  below where they are you get halfway across splashing you guys see snizzler trying to make  her way over to where you guys are  ivan laughing theres water down there  marisha seriously you guys  matt roll another swim check to try and make it 
none	 the other half of the way  ivan come on snizzler  marisha oh thats better 13  matt 13 you make your way up to the edge like grunting you guys can look down now and you can  just barely see outside of your darkvision here you see snizzler approach and is now treading  water at the bottom of the cistern below you  ashly well lower the ropes snizz  marisha come on can i see if i can find purchase on a little rock off to the side i can hold onto  matt yeah 
none	 you go over and reach over and you grab a rock and pull onto it and pull your weight  up and your fingers slip off of it there is a slick liquid from general grime  ivan grab the rope  marisha come on come on  taliesin i drop the rope  matt okay the rope thumps into the water next to you you grab onto it and the rest of you guys  slowly pull snizzler back up onto the entranceway  ivan my turn my turn i want to be thrown next my turn  taliesin 
none	 im going to look at the ceiling i want to see if there is anywhere we can attach the rope  to the ceiling to make a swing  matt currently it is a dome a smooth stone dome that then has three openings where the rainwater  is pouring into currently and filling the bottom of the cistern  ashly so the only way up is basically those little stones that we can see  ivan the only other thing i can think of taking my snizzler hat off for a sec er my grizznak  is i could 
none	 potentially mage hand up the rope but i dont think i can tie it i can just move it up  phil you know what no ill climb up and tie the rope and everyone else can climb  ivan well catch you if you fall  phil right thatll happen i climb up to the grate with the rope  matt okay go ahead and roll a climb check  phil 12 plus climb 18  matt 18 as you pull yourself up grunting and it is a slight curvature so youre like hanging  and holding onto it 
none	 but in true goblin tom cruise fashion keeping a stern expression on your face  phil well you know tom cruise is a goblin thats why hes so small  matt makes sense hopping on the sofa  phil goblin noise im in love im in love im in love  matt as you pull yourself up tiny goblin feet dangling below keeping your focus browntooth  you bring your way across the ceiling carrying that rope in your grin you get up to the edge of  where the waters currently pouring into the cistern and its moving past 
none	 i need you to roll  another climb check to try and keep holding  phil nine  matt nine your fingers are starting to slip youre starting to slip  ivan can i cast open on the grate and see if itll maybe lift him up with it open  matt yeah you know what for a  ivan do you want me to grab it  matt yeah lets see if we can whats the spell this is open  ivan open  ashly id just like to take this moment to say that browntooth is clearly the 
none	 coolest goblin of  all the goblins  laughter  ashly he transcends space and time and climbed a slippery wall with a rope in his mouth  phil almost climbed  marisha the rest of us are total degenerates  ashly im just throwing people like  matt yeah theres no resistance to it as youre slipping slipping all of a sudden the grate that  contains the water opens and actually slams into your side but you manage to catch onto it it  knocks the wind out of you but you manage to hold on the edge 
dung	 you catch your breath and you realize  this is first off holding your weight and second theres a number of cross iron bars that  are all welded together that would be a good place probably to tie the rope off  phil i think i will tie the rope to the things that would make a good place to tie the rope  ivan youre welcome  phil yeah right i saved your life you saved mine twice  ivan well you know what now weve got one left  phil one left  ivan which means i 
none	 owe you a bird sings birdy bird bird bird bird bird for you bird for me  two birds for you and one bird for me smash it twist it turn it in a stew stick it in your face  and you love and i love you  marisha i love that song  phil hes got many songs  taliesin very impressive  matt as you finish tying the rope helping each person up each of you manage to climb having it  tossed back it takes you a while to get going but you do manage to 
none	  phil weve now been on this quest for five days  taliesin in my head its all henson puppets and its adorable its like fraggle rock im there  cheering  ashly the other goblin crew has already made it theyve got the stone theyre back thats whats  already happened in my head ill be disappointed if thats not what happens  matt in climbing up the side of the grate however going on the other side you are now  fighting against the torrent of water so i need each of you to make a climb check 
none	  marisha oh were all doing this  taliesin yeah yeah  matt you dont have to you can stay back in the sewers  phil wait for the fire to come  ashly 14  marisha oh my god  phil 16  taliesin nine  marisha three  matt laughing what do you have grizznak  ivan two  matt two okay so  phil who do we have to save now  matt well say for the sake of brevity here an additional hour or so is spent perpetually  retrieving your allies who keep getting all 
none	 the way up and then splash right into the water but  you have to admire the tenacity  taliesin i drink everything in my flask at this point  matt okay so you get your ki point going  taliesin ive got to keep drinking  matt eventually you guys make your way up past the flowing of water which has slowed now and  thats probably how youre able to do it  taliesin someone upstairs finally jiggled the toilet  matt yeah you make your way up into an upper sewage system and you guys crawl through 
none	 what is  a much smaller series of pipes to the point where you as goblins still have to crawl to make your  way through the sludge is thicker here and what little bit of rain is pouring through you manage  to keep between your arms and legs eventually you find your way into the bottom of some sort of a  chamber that is filled with apparently human waste  taliesin yes  ashly the blue poop has to be here  marisha i take the poop and i start making a ball out of it and 
none	 i light it to see how flammable it is  matt okay  ivan this is totally logical  phil if it were church people they drink a lot so it should light up  matt like the finest of candles it does catch fire and begins to burn slowly its not dry  enough to catch were having this conversation  taliesin no im really excited that this is a thing thats happening right now  matt it would need to be suitably dried out to work as proper fuel but  marisha definitely lots of alcohol lots of 
none	 drugs yeah i start packaging up some of the poop  matt all right  phil i look for any sort of egress  matt make a perception check  ivan same  ashly why not ill do it too  ivan 16  phil eight  ashly 18  matt all right while youre collecting your filthy prize both piglet and grizznek you guys  look up and notice that there is a wooden or stone ceiling but a singular opening above you like a  circular hole  ivan first i would like to listen to see if 
none	 theres any stinky stupid humans upstairs  matt make a perception check  ivan singing stinky stupid humans eight  phil i love that game stinky stupid humans  ivan theyre so dumb stinky stupid humans but theyre fun to kill  matt you listen and you hear the muffled noises of conversation as well it sounds like there are  a few different voices though theyre behind a couple of walls from where you are  ivan so theyre not straight above us  matt no  ivan im going to cast open again on that opening  matt 
none	 okay you cast open the opening is open  laughter  matt so the spell is a success  ivan yes i will climb up through the poop chute  matt as you pull yourself up out of it in a wonderful medieval version of the ghoulies vhs  cover you pull yourself out from  taliesin wow we went back  matt oh man i couldnt go near toilets for years because of that movie cover at the vhs store  ivan i stick my head up and i look through the toilet seat and then i go blows 
tavern	 nose and knock a  huge chunk of poop out of my nostril  matt there you go glancing ahead your open spell missed but did hit the front of the  outhouse which has currently swung open in the midday facing the window leading into the tavern  that you guys nearly entered beforehand  ivan oh close  matt closes shut however it does appear to be nestled in an alleyway on the outside of it its  a very thin opening you didnt see any people actually in the alley you saw the outside of a  
town	 window and a street thoroughfare  ivan mmm  phil where are we  ivan were outside now we seem to be in what the humans use to get rid of all their precious waste  taliesin were inside an outhouse  phil that sounds sort of oxymoronic  ivan were in one of those redundant human cubes in which humans go to poop inside of instead of  doing it where they sleep which is way more practical  ashly wait guys those church things isnt there like a symbol that people use like a circle  or like 
town	  ivan well i say we get browntooth up here and he can go scout it out right browntooth  phil if it keeps you from blowing things up and you setting anything on fire right i climb up  and go out the outhouse to stealthily move into the street  matt all righty so as you  ivan wait wait wait im also going to cast penumbra on him  matt okay  ivan so penumbra it basically puts a permanent shadow on him  phil oh i thought it gave me a number from before  laughs 
tavern	  matt go ahead and roll a stealth check if you could  ivan makes it so that even light spells make him still look like hes covered in shadow  phil 32  matt all right as you stumble into the shady alley looking about you glance over the side of  the window real fast into the tavern and you do see there are probably a dozen patrons in there  some drinks being served a guard at the door on the inside however looking to your left there  the alleyway spills out into a main street 
town	 thoroughfare and you can see people walking by  families with children theres a general air of jovial energy to it and some people are wearing  flower crowns on their heads you can see carts being put along the street seems like the  festival you were told of this terrible human festival seems to be in full swing go ahead and  make a survival check  phil 16  matt you come out to the edge of the alleyway glance about first thing you notice is the sun in  the sky you were like eh its 
town	 probably middayish no its pushing toward sunset now  you probably have another hour of sunlight so you dont know how much longer this festivals  going to be going you spent quite a while getting here and wandering the sewers  ivan as per typical goblin fashion  matt indeed however you notice that everyone is walking a certain direction and one there are a  number of carts that are going by there are currently unmanned closed carts that would be  used to sell fruit and fish this being a port town fish is a big export 
town	 here and the alleyways  that you came out of there is a second alleyway that offshoots from where the outhouse is that  goes between the buildings off the main thoroughfare this is what youre able to gauge in  your time out here  phil i go back and tell them what ive seen so everybodys going that way  ivan we should probably go  all that way  ivan that way  ashly that way  marisha maybe if we get on each others shoulders with a coat well look like peoples  ashly i want 
tavern	 do a perception roll for a big coat 14  matt you glance over the window and look inside one of the bar patrons sitting by the bar is  this rotundlooking gentleman in his late 40s balding hair a double chin leaned forward on the  bar looking like hes ready to pass out from the amount of alcohol hes been drinking he is in the  inside of the tavern he has a very long coat that drapes past the bar  ashly we got to do it theres no alternative  phil there is an alternative theres 
none	 the little alleyway  ashly no alternative this is what were doing how many patrons are there do i get to know from  my perception check  matt glancing in there you see probably ten patrons altogether  marisha i look around do i see anything that looks like a childrens clothing store maybe two  of us can be a child and three of us can be an adult  ivan if each one of us is a leg and were three goblins tall thats six feet  marisha okay yeah no youre right grizz  phil look
