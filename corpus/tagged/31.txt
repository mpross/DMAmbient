none	 also kymal or westruun one of the two  marisha do we not know anybody at fort daxio  matt no one that you know of fort daxio  laura is allura still here is allura still around  matt allura is still around  laura allura do you know anyone in fort daxio  matt unfortunately the one member i know is the warmaster mikael daxio the father of riskel but  as far as i know he is currently sealed off in syngorn with the rest of the army  laura right shit  marisha okay hang on 
none	 wait is fort daxio near syngorn  laura no the army remember part of the army got sent to syngorn and then syngorn bamfed  away  matt yeah three of the regiments in fort daxio were sent to syngorn with the supposed dragon  incursion in the stormcrest mountains most of them went with syngorn when it got pulled back to  the feywild and one regiment still remains at fort daxio fort daxio is north of emon  marisha are there any guards from emon here because the guards were also the guards from emon  went to 
none	 syngorn so maybe someone in one of the guards knows one of the guards in fort daxio  laura this is a lot of work  marisha yeah is there an easier way to go about this  matt you could ask around  marisha i am going to go and see if i can find one of the whitestone guards  matt make an investigation check  marisha oh i am not good at these i think that its a 12 let me double check my investigation  i dont do this a whole lot yeah 12  matt 
none	 okay you spend the next 30 minutes asking around for various guards and the few that you do  know that are from emon are like i dont really know anyone from daxio its very regimented i  wasnt interested in the military i wanted to more sit around the city and get paid to wear armor  marisha so theyre more militant or like the army  matt it is where the military is yeah  marisha you dont have any army friends are there any army friends here  matt i think there are a few here that 
none	 at least might know that but i am not one of them sorry  marisha where where point me  matt shouting i dont know that way  marisha shouting all right i go that way  matt keyleth spends the better part of the next hour or so without luck unable to really find  anyone to match the description from before  marisha guys this sucks we dont know anyone in daxio  laura should we just fucking go there  liam this is like when youre on a level in a video game and you run around 
none	 and around and  around you cant find that thing that triggers to the next section of the video game  sam wait gilmore knows everybody he must know someone in daxio  laura i dont know if he knows army people  liam well he knows a lot of people  marisha all right if gilmore doesnt know anybody then we are going to the nearest  location and then were hoofing it  laura yeah  sam kraghammer is nearish  marisha all right lets go talk to gilmore  laura thats true  matt okay as the 
none	 rest of your council has essentially scattered throughout whitestone castle  since your meeting gilmore is easy to find beginning to make his way out of the castle down  towards his homestead and prepare what he has for the coming struggle so as you intercept him  walking down the outside he says oh hi im sorry what did you need  sam do you know anyone in fort daxio please say yes  matt chuckles sighs you know i believe i have had a couple of people come through my  establishment  travis is that what they 
none	 call it come through my establishment  taliesin yes that is exactly what they call it when you have an establishment  matt that is actually exactly what they call it grog  marisha i mean we dont necessarily need to know anybody if you happen to know a very fast way to  get to daxio  matt i mean there are magics that can get a person there quickly but  laura are there trees are there lots of trees its grassland  liam shaun could you send one of us there is that possible by any chance 
none	  matt let me think  laura one why one  liam because if one of us goes with the gatestone keyleth can jump over she can see  trees there she can tree her way back here i mean i dont know im spitballing  laura it seems like a really long process  liam yeah all right wheres your great idea  laura well one of us goes there finds a tree and then bamfs back and keyleth brings us all over  sam no keyleth can scry on you once youre there and see the tree  
none	 laura fabulous send one of us over there  marisha yeah yeah  matt he says well i cant but allura might be able to help with that ask her  marisha all right back to allura  sam sings yakety sax  liam chickens with our heads cut off eh  travis in and out of the doors  taliesin like a monty python animation back and forth  marisha trip three times  matt exactly apparently gilmore doesnt seem to have access to the type of translocation magic  youre asking about  marisha all right  matt 
none	 you eventually find your way to allura in whitestone castle who is currently having a  conversation with cassandra she turns back to you and as you ask the same question she  responds with a i actually do have prepared i can bring up to eight other individuals with me  laura oh how perfect  travis wait wait one somebody else do this  laura were good  ashley i think were okay its just right  marisha are you fine doing that  matt yes i can only go there so we have to have some way 
none	 of returning which i believe you  can handle that all right  marisha i can get us back yeah  matt all right then whenever you are ready i suppose  laura great  liam nows as good a time as any yeah  matt all right gather round she puts her arms out and gestures for you to reach in like a hand circle  ashley come on grog  sam are we taking kima  laura kima can we take kima  sam do we want to take kima  matt of course i have to go 
none	 get her  liam one too many though isnt it  laura no this is perfect  liam i swore she said eight or eight along with her  matt eight along with me  travis were just reconning  laura yeah its fine lets just go  liam you know we always take her and leave you why dont we flip that  matt just dont tell her she gets a bit testy when shes not included all right very well  she takes your hands some of you close your eyes some of you dont that familiar rush 
none	 of warmth  underneath your stomach begins fill  travis fart noise  matt your chest cavity laughs grog poots out the side and it distracts you momentarily  before you watch the ground beneath you this line of blue arcane energy begins to link each one of  your feet together in a circle as it does these starlike extensions begin to appear out in the  center and as soon as they all meet into one crystalline structure there is a flash of light  your vision goes white and as it slowly adjusts to the daylight this 
none	 light breeze soothing you  you look around and see yourselves now standing in the othendin pass which is this large rocky  ravine that rides up on each side of you to these tall cliff side edges of the very very southwest  side of the cliffkeep mountains this is far north of emon while you see the ground itself is very  cracked land you can see dry and long dead bushes you can see bits and pieces of dead trees  that have for a long time been petrified broken over or been left without much of 
none	 an actual  fertile ground to exist in you glance off to the eastern side of your direction and you can see a  very large cluster of reddishbrown trees a forest there that has long died or at least  is definitely in the fall season type of color change but the vegetation around here is very  sparse very scrub and in some cases very dry and dead you do see to the immediate northwest of  your current location clinging to the side of the mountain cliff what you assume is fort daxio a  massive stronghold 
none	 built of gray and brown stone an outer wall perimeter that completely surrounds  it buttressed against each side of the cliff and within you can see a multitiered fortress  structure within built specifically for defending against any sort of army siege or incursion  laura wow that is way bigger than i expected it to be  taliesin thats what im talking about  travis can i check the skies anything flying around  matt make a perception check  travis hey this will go well three  matt you begin to look up and you see a 
none	 small bird and its really small and itss really  cute and your eyes watch it and you watch it fling off that way  travis gasp pike  ashley oh lookit  travis what  ashley its a little  travis its tiny right  ashley its so cute  travis yeah he chirps i bet  ashley its a little thorbilly  laughter  travis can you make thorbilly land on your finger like a disney princess  ashley can i this is so dumb yeah im going to try  sam and taliesin animal handling check  
none	 matt i was going to say make an animal handling check  laura wow have we ever rolled this  sam one we have done one  taliesin we have done one  sam one i dont remember why or who did it  laura oh my god youve got really good animal handling  ashley well all right  travis and you rolled a dick  laura is it a dick  ashley it s a four okay nine  marisha thats kind of a dick  matt you make three clunks clomping plate armor pike steps before the 
none	 bird  no audio  matt into the sky  ashley it was a baby thorbilly theyre a little more shy  travis yeah no yeah he was very scared  laughter  travis its all right next time  laura does it look like anybodys in the fort looking down at us are we far enough away  matt make a perception check youre a few hundred yards away  laura fucking shit balls 16  matt 16 okay best you can tell you do see some shapes along the top of the outer battlements the  wall that 
town	 surrounds the structure however from this distance youre not sure if they have seen  you yet  laura all right  liam best you can tell its shitballs  laura its shitballs up there just lots of shit  marisha whats a shitball  sam hey if we walk up to the fort whats our cover story  taliesin no cover story we tell them who we are and what were doing here  sam were dragon fighters bringing the fight to their town  laura were not bringing the fight here  sam we are looking to fight 
town	 here  laura oh shit we are thats the plan thats my plan  liam its not a town its  taliesin its a fort  sam well whatever it is i dont think we should tell them that were dragon fighters bringing  the fight to their fort  marisha well actually thats a good point whose fort is this  laura daxios whos in syngorn no it is  matt well that is the warmaster who has been assigned by emon this is technically where the  majority of the military of emon is stationed  marisha so 
none	 this is emons military not syngorns  matt yeah this is emons military  laura and we have got allura with us shes on the council  taliesin and they are at war as well  ashley this is already going well  liam were protecting the world  laura super good  marisha well yeah if this is for emon then its for emon  taliesin this is specifically where you want things to attack as opposed to towns  laura but they might be skittish so we should probably have a little protection as we go up there 
none	  marisha do we have any idea on who were talking to  laura dudes i think their commanding officers are in syngorn for the most part  travis do we need a white flag as we approach  laura sure  liam do you want to hold up pike as we walk closer  ashley i can whip my hair  all singing i whip my hair back and forth i whip my hair back and forth  matt yeah its 5thlevel you can do that  laughter  matt as you guys begin to approach the outside of 
none	 fort daxio you can see a number of the figures on  the wall beginning to move faster and gathering at edges you can see one of a few defensive ballistae  being locked in allura begins stepping into the front and she puts her hand out and says dont  worry let me do the talking for this  sam ooh okay  matt as you guys begin to approach the gate you hear a small horn give off this arrival  notification this pathetic horn noise but deeper and much cooler sounding than that  laughter  liam 
none	 air horn  ashley air horn  travis come on man  matt and sam air horn  matt because i am not a war horn  marisha i imagine a kid with a kazoo  laughter  all kazoo  taliesin deep and cool horn  travis of all the sounds you could make  matt fort daxio is very sparsely run right now  sam all their horns were broken in the war  matt they left the regiment behind with a small conch shell that is partially broken  taliesin piggys got the conch  laura and 
none	 ashley pathetic horn noise  liam did we just find your achilles heel  marisha horn noises  liam man of a thousand voices animals creatures cant do horns  taliesin and no horns  matt deep and cool horn sound  cheering  matt there you go to make you happy  liam i dont do horns they sicken me  matt thats more hit points on thordak just keep a tally all right as you approach and begin to  gather and allura steps forward she takes a few more steps and then stops puts her other hand 
none	 up  to give you a signal to hold back she speaks out across the expanse arcanist allura vysoren  member of the taldorei council here with allies to speak with who resides within will you allow  us passage theres a pause you hear the sound of the ballista crank being loosened and  then you see the two front gates slightly open she puts her hands down very well walk with me  laura they didnt even check us out just letting us in be on your guard theyre too trusting  sam okay  matt as you 
none	 guys approach the gates and begin to walk through you can see there is about 15 guards  stationed above the top that all have cocked crossbows that are trained on you guys  laura never mind  matt not directly ready to fire but cautiously watching you as you progress allura leads  through leading you guys into the main entryway and as you walk into this front area the  pseudocourtyard or central area between the wall and the stronghold itself the same cracked  exterior but you can see there is a trebuchet over there there are 
none	 countersiege weaponry some  of it unused for a while and probably in need of some level of repair you do see a number of other  armored individuals and the armor you see on the military stationed here is much more than the  armors of emon or any of the local guard that you are used to these are very heavy regimented  plate tower shields you can see spears that are very nasty looking and very strong in  construction a lot of these almost resemble a lot of the dwarven make you saw in kraghammer before 
none	  so whether this is an alliance through kraghammer and emon that came to this or the design was  borrowed to some extent a lot of the armor is more square and bulky than the more refined armor  you have seen in more southern areas of the taldorei continent immediately as you step in  while the guards still have their weapons trained on you on the other side of the wall you see ten  individuals approaching armored you can see these individuals their shields are large heavy  tower shields with a goldish circular symbol on 
dung	 the front that has an inlay thats almost like a  polished mirror like a big old oval mirror as part of the center shield itself as these armored  individuals approach one of them in the center has her helm off and seems to be leading this  push to greet you at that front you see a woman very stern look dark skinned very short ebony hair  and a very tough dour expression on her face as she quickly brushes up towards the front and as  she steps forward she slams her shield into the ground 
none	 and gives a nod as the rest of the  soldiers stop she bows her head and goes allura we finally have answer from the council  its been silence for weeks allura bows her head and says well general let me introduce  you to our allies here these are vox machina they are friends they are and the general  breaks once more into the conversation and says thats fine so you are here with your allies  any word from mikael any word from the rest of the regiments  laura theyre in syngorn  matt still 
none	 in syngorn  laura as far as we know  matt all right well sighs you see the tension thats been building in her since she  approached you guys begins to slowly fade with this sense of digesting the difficulty of the  situation theres an awkward pause and allura says can we speak in less she looks up at the  rest of the battlements less armed circles if you dont mind the general looks up and nods  very well my apologies i am general elle gorgofon  laura elle gorgofon  matt elle gorgofon i am 
none	 the commander of the aegis regiment and i welcome you for the time  being to fort daxio follow me she turns on her heel and begins to march at a very brisk pace back  towards the stronghold itself the other soldiers turning around as well allura gives you all a  head nudge to follow suit  sam okay yeah lets go this is going great we havent even done anything wrong yet  taliesin give us time  matt as youre walking around keyleth vex and vax looking over the number of soldiers that are  here 
none	 you have roughly 20 or so you see on the top of the wall maybe 25 to 30 that occasionally are  stepping around the base of it or the interior of this main courtyard for the entirety of the army  of emon the regiment thats here doesnt seem to be very busy or very well  marisha stocked  matt staffed there arent a lot of people here this regiment is not extremely large it looks  like this may be the defensive regiment that was left behind to guard the fort when other  regiments are sent 
none	 out on whatever duties  marisha you said we saw 40  laura 50 people  matt 40 to 50 soldiers on the outskirts of the stronghold you dont know how many are inside  necessarily  travis its like the alamo  matt its fairly lightly guarded right now  travis which ended well  taliesin it depends on who you ask really  matt as you guys enter the stronghold its beautiful in its construction it also looks like  its been in some level of disrepair its definitely built for function the furniture and  decor on 
none	 the interior is very simple very pragmatic it is made for function more than  presentation youre led through two small hallways to the right to one central chamber where  there are a series of benches and chairs whatever has been assembled to the area and pulled to the  center area it would be considered a conversation room or war room in some circumstances but its  very haphazardly thrown together you also do notice that there are a couple of rooms that have  a foul stench and as you glance off to the left into the 
dung	 inside you can see there are piles of  folded dark material  laura toilet paper  laughter  matt its your favored terrain but you guys are led into this main chamber  sam do we just pass by those things  matt as you begin to walk by you glance over and see it as you go  laura can we see what it is it looks like dark folded material  matt if you want to stop and look behind you can have a closer look its a hidetype material it  looks folded and then as 
none	 you walk in you can see its actually a series of piled corpses of some  sort of leathery creature or creatures that have been pushed into an area there  taliesin im going to take this moment to change out my attunement for my gloves from my sword im  going to put my gloves on and unattune to my sword  matt okay  laura general how many soldiers does this fort support  matt as she enters the chamber ahead of you and turns around and sits in her chair her shield set  to the side 
none	 we currently now as the aegis regiment have a grand total of 225 soldiers  sam pretty good  laura and how many can be here  matt as far as all the regiments  laura yeah  matt were looking at between how many survive or return from syngorn close to 2000  laura quietly all right  sam so you have 225 here currently  matt we do  sam and how is morale everyone have enough supplies and ready to defend the fort if needed  matt to be perfectly honest and the door closes behind you 
none	 as two of the guards step in  front and watch it as you all find your seats or at least stand in the space general elle goes  to be perfectly honest we are very low on supplies any of the trade routes to and from  kraghammer have been constantly harried by wyvern riders weve had to defend our location a couple  times by some errant wandering sentinel wyvern riders its been sighs were on the edge of  starvation  travis shit pardon my bluntness but any flybys by thordak himself  matt thankfully no he 
none	 would tear into this place in but an instant we only have bits of  information weve had from few scouts weve sent southward weve had some conversations to and  from emon but only half of them have even returned and those that have say that its a very  dire situation so weve been awaiting any word we can from mikael sorry from the warmaster and  nothing so as far as i know and have known we are on our own and left possibly to die while the  rest of this entire country burns to the 
none	 ground so seeing some seemingly friendly faces and she  nods towards allura is the best news ive had in a very long time  laura in your warmasters defense it might be beyond his control to get back here  taliesin things are dire  marisha thordak is changing the entire landscape to be very similar to the fire plane  laura and hes stuck in the feywild  matt whos stuck in the feywild  laura the warmaster here  matt mikael  laura yeah mikael  marisha all of syngorn actually  sam are we telling them 
none	 this  laura and taliesin why not  matt well at least i know that they werent wiped out and thats good news but still were  not enough to even attempt an incursion on emon by our own  taliesin well that is true and that is the purpose for our visit  travis we may be able to help though at least where resources are concerned  taliesin oh i would say so we have to that will be job one  marisha how is the land around the fort do you have any farm land currently  
none	 matt what little bit grows here is not of the edible variety we have to rely on the farmlands  of emon for most of our produce and those have dried up so weve been left to hunting and  slaughtering what is available which is not much these days as were constantly in battle with the  giants of the north to keep some semblance of food intake to keep our soldiers fed and living  sam quietly we can help a little with that right  taliesin oh yes and well have to  laura maybe throw some 
none	 food through a tree when we open it up just chuck some corn  taliesin sandwiches  laura take some spaghetti  travis could we load up a cart though and wheel it through  sam well but cant keyleth make some farmland right here in the fort little small garden sort  of a thing  marisha it takes eight hours but it seems like we might have to do some field trips anyway  taliesin the airship will be heading here anyway we can load it with supplies as well  travis to here  taliesin to here 
none	 everything will be coming here if things go the way that we hope they will  travis general can i ask are you close with mikael  matt ive been under him for 15 years yes  travis consider yourself friends  matt friends  liam youre the worst  travis i mean it didnt even take a second not one second have you no decency  taliesin i specifically looked left hoping  matt clears throat  laura sorry youve been under him for how long  matt 15 years  laura 15 years long time  travis pick 
none	 a fight pick a fight with the general then good thats good  matt allura are these trusted and allura nods very they have a thought more of a plan  a plan that if it works should put us in a much more advantageous position in the conflict with  the chroma conclave please give them your ear give them your respect theyve proven time and  time again to be capable  marisha forgive us weve just been through a lot elle  taliesin weve actually already killed three of the five chroma conclave  matt she leans 
none	 back in her chair is this true  marisha i reach in and i pull out one of the teeth and throw it on the table  taliesin you cant just keep giving those away  matt she catches it in the middle she gives you a very stern look and eyeing you over trying to  give you a read and then slowly it goes from group to group well then perhaps this is our  salvation throws the tooth back to you  marisha did you see that  laura that was a good catch  marisha thanks 
none	 guys  taliesin before we get ahead of ourselves our hope is that we think we can lure thordak out of  the city and we think we can get him into a piece of terrain that gives us the advantage we were  hoping this would be where we consolidate our forces and make a stand against him  matt you wish to bring the cinder king here  sam not just the cinder king we would also bring allies to support you and to buffer your forces  and hopefully with enough planning time to get you and 
none	 your men back on their feet well fed and  ready for a fight  laura were hoping well be able to bring mikael and syngorns army back as well  sam mikaels navy  liam yes  taliesin i hate you all we either face him in his home in his terrain with his guards  everywhere with people we cannot trust everywhere or we lure him out and we bring him  somewhere where we know the terrain where we have places to hide where we are prepared for him  matt she nods and leans forward putting 
none	 one hand over the other and her elbows on the edge of her  knees on her chair and what makes you think a creature of such power and intelligence would ever  leave such an advantageous position to be vulnerable  sam to kill us we are the bait and we are also the dragon killer so he will come here to kill  us or to at least investigate our whereabouts we hope and when he arrives well wait in ambush  matt very well if youre confident you have fort daxio and the aegis regiment behind you 
none	 i  just hope you know what youre doing  travis oh we do weve killed like a number of them and none of us have died yet  laura not even a little bit  travis we started with this many and this many is still here is what i mean  sam i mean technically we started the day with this many thats for sure  several yeah  marisha whats unconsciousness nervous laughter  matt you can see her expression drop a little bit into a curled eyebrow of confusion  laura three down  taliesin theres 
none	 no guarantees but this is the best bet this is the best place for us at this  point im sure you understand there are no guarantees  laura do you have underground facilities something that guards against dragon fire  marisha we noticed a few of the trebuchets when we walked in how many of those do you have  matt functional three  taliesin we can work on that  marisha percy  laura how many nonfunctional  matt 12  taliesin we can work on that  matt very not functional look siege warfare hasnt been necessary 
none	 for a very long time let  alone countersiege fort daxio hasnt been under attack in close to 200 years  laura it could happen when was the last time ancient dragons took over the land  matt which is exactly why we dont have any dragon fireprotected subterranean tunnels my  apologies but you know even our budgets are limited  taliesin well we can get to work we can get people in we can start making this place ready  and we can start making a plan we have a lot of power and a lot of energy 
none	 at our disposal  travis yeah its a montage waiting to happen  matt how soon do you imagine this to transpire  laura the montage  marisha oh we can get started right now  matt no i mean call wait wait wait she waves her hand and interrupts the montage  wait wait wait wait  travis singing going to build some tunnels make them look real cool  sam it will take us a few days if not weeks to summon all of our allies here and well need to  get your forces ready as well 
none	 is this something that you can fully support would you rather fight  bravely against a dragon than die a slow starvation death  matt we exist here as protectors of emon and the council of taldorei with the current state of  things whats left of those things we choose and have given ourselves to protect if we can we  will so yes  sam okay  taliesin well step one is food then  travis yeah resources and food  marisha what time is it here just creating farmland all over the world  matt id say 
none	 its midday  laura we need some source of water too  sam we have one pitcher of water whenever we need it  travis yeah baby  taliesin actually they might already have a well here  marisha yeah like a well  matt yeah it still rains here and it has watershed elements that come through the othendin  pass from the cliffkeep mountains its the ground in this particular valley like elements of the  cliffkeep in the north it isnt very fertile for any sort of vegetation to take root  taliesin theres no food you 
none	 can grow underground is there  travis i saw this movie called the martian if we shit all over everything itll grow yeah lots  of potatoes grow from shit  ashley maybe if we could make a composting system for them  sam so you cant grow anything right now  marisha can i get someone to take me to a courtyard or something like that  matt the courtyard is the area between the outer wall and the fortress itself which is all built  into the side of the mountain  marisha can i do some sort 
none	 of druidy soil test ph test or something like that  matt make a nature check  marisha see if i can grow stuff here with a plant growth spell just a nature check 15  matt 15 i mean it doesnt take too much for you to find out that the dirt here the land itself  is very nutrientdevoid it is a near salt and rock land which is why a lot of it does not  facilitate  marisha can i not fix that with a plant growth spell  matt do you have a spell that 
none	 could fix that  marisha does plant growth fix that  matt lets read the spell  taliesin we have options  sam for at least a day i could create a soup kitchen people could come in and take a bowl and leave  laura could they have something with veggies too though  matt plant growth affects plants that already exist as opposed to the actual land itself  marisha all plants in a halfmile radius  laura isnt there something that turns the land fertile  ashley poop  taliesin thats like 5th level  ashley do 
none	 you have horses lots of horses  liam but i mean scanlan until we are ready to pull the trigger  sam yeah i mean i could create a soup kitchen basically  liam once a day yeah  sam sure yeah we can have a bread line going in and out  travis in the meantime percy could take a look at some of the weaponry maybe look at building a  tunnel or a bunker  sam general whens the next feeding time for your next shift of men  matt weve had to relegate it to just 
none	 morning and afternoon meals to help ration our supplies  so i would say four hours til dusk that would be the next allotted mess time  taliesin can this actually work can we use the spell this way  sam what the mansion sure i think so right  matt its a unique way of utilizing it but i dont see why not  laura its a sizzler i like it  phone ringing  sam oh shit shit balls i cant  matt we talked about this  sam sorry i had an alarm to take off my 
none	 shirt  laura oh you did  sam i have to wear four shirts tonight because of reasons  laughter  travis really  sam yeah its an anal thing ive worn 70 different shirts on 73 episodes of the show so if  i wear four tonight thats one for every episode  travis oh my god  liam that makes sense thats time well spent  laughter  travis liam and i will give you a dunking in the bathroom after the break  liam youll get a swirly forthwith  liam are we going to double back 
none	 to dad  laura we have to right  liam yeah soon  taliesin we have to at least send word thats the first thing we have to  laura i dont know how we send word to the feywild without going to the feywild  marisha i can plane shift us there after we sleep and i learn it the next morning  liam now that youve brought us there do you think you could get us closer  marisha i could take us straight there yeah  travis percy what do you think of looking at all this 
none	 weaponry  taliesin im going to look at the battalions see if i can drudge up some people who actually know  how these things function and start seeing how difficult it would be to get the ones that are broken  working  matt okay  marisha can i figure out if the ground is sturdy enough if i start digging little bunkers that  would be okay  matt bunkers for  marisha underground bunkers for hiding from a flaming dragon breath  matt i mean you could probably its hard packed very solid ground westruun is where 
none	 you  did it  marisha westruun we did the bunkers  laura didnt we do underground stuff in whitestone too though  marisha i did a bunker under the sun tree kind of  taliesin we do a lot of bunkers  matt at this point keyleth almost has a burrowing speed  marisha its like that fallout minigame that they came out with the app basically that  travis do we want to crack out the mansion  sam yeah sure ill crack out the mansion where should i put it general elle  matt im not entirely 
none	 certain as to what youre attempting to do here  sam oh im sorry through magical means we are all not to brag we are all super powerful were  like a band of traveling superheroes one of the things that i can do is make a room or a home a  magical home where everyone can go in and get a quick meal and then go back out to work again so  with your permission and a location i can create this magical dwelling  matt keeping her eyes trained on you she leans over towards allura 
none	 i cant tell is the little  man fucking with me  taliesin he gets that a lot  matt allura goes usually yes but no hes being completely honest right now  then by all means yes  sam is there a spot where you would like your men to  matt follow me to the mess hall she seems legitimately spooked and unsure what to make of  you but leads you on anyway  sam most women are  matt but yeah you can set up in the mess hall entranceway there is a large hall with 
none	 long  tables and she says that would be probably the most optimal place to go ahead and set up shop there  marisha question  matt yes  marisha legi logi fumbling words logistical question thats the word i was looking for  matt there you go  liam stuff and things  marisha stuff and things things and stuff they are low on meat because theyre low on animals  matt most of their food was being brought by the trade routes since then theyve had to hunt for  food and go off of whatever stock and 
none	 store they had and even thats running really low theyre  hardpressed to maintain  marisha could i do a conjure woodland beings and conjure a bunch of deer  travis fuck yes  marisha and then we could play shooting range  laura do they disappear when theyre dead  marisha oh right they disappear  matt yep they would watch that meat go poof sorry  marisha oh thats mean no i dont do that by the way i was asking ahead of time because that  would be mean never mind  travis also awesome  matt 
none	 this one druid got to level three and then opened its own hunting emporium and never became  an adventurer again  travis supply for days  matt yeah so youre setting up the mess hall youre checking in to see go ahead and make an  investigation check taliesin if you dont mind  taliesin ew seven  matt seven asking around over the next couple hours or so it appears that most anyone who would  be a specialist in any sort of siege weaponry was part of the other regiments that are no longer  part of 
none	 daxio even so some of the weaponry that was here looks like it was ordered partially just  to get the money in a lot of the trebuchets that are functional are very dryrotted and have seen  many rainy winters and havent really been kept up and youre not even sure if theyd fire the  ones that have broken down a lot of the wood rotted there isnt a lot of weaponry it looks  like the three could be fixed up and be functional but the ones that arent it would  take you weeks with new 
none	 lumber and new materials to even get them remotely functional  taliesin all right we can make do we can make do i will definitely start making plans for the  three that are functional to get them in tiptop working condition  matt with successful tinkering checks on this with a few borrowed hands for manpower you could  probably repair one per day of work thats a full eighthour day of work so be aware of that  taliesin all right how many more of them were disheveled and broken  matt about 12 of them  taliesin 
none	 and they each had their own spot  matt the three that are still semifunctional are pulled back about 60 or so feet from the edge of  the walls and then the rest of them have actually been wheeled over into the corner and have all  been jammed up on the edge unused and not to take up space  taliesin okay thatll start at least im going to look for any improvements that can be made in  defensive measures against flying creatures in any way if we use some stone shape we can make this  
none	 even more defendable against flying creatures et cetera  travis general just because like im an inquisitive mind what is the travel time from  here to emon on foot on a beast those two  matt on foot id say it would put you at about five to six days horseback straight through  without sleep and running the beast into the ground you could do it in a day  travis wow cool good deal  marisha are you trying to think of bringing back supplies  travis no i was seeing if i could run there in 
none	 a night and back  marisha just to scout it out  travis no im not fucking running over there are you crazy i was just curious  matt anything else anyone else is looking to do  marisha i guess i can start on the underground bunker for tonight i guess  taliesin ill start on one of the oh god my brain has completely turned to mush  matt trebuchet  taliesin trebuchet thank you i love the word  matt go ahead and make a tinkering check  sam what are you guys going to do  
none	 travis that mess hall is there a gathering quarters for the soldiers  matt there is a barracks built into the stronghold where many of the soldiers sleep where  there is a common area with general tables card games and things to pass the time there is a  small library with various books you get the sense here as you begin to walk around and see the  soldiers since these guys are essentially the defensive reserve for fort daxio and daxio  doesnt see a lot of military action its very much a trainandwait type circumstance and 
none	 many  of the soldiers though they have grown a little gaunt in the face from lack of resources also  appear to be emotionally drained from having nothing to do and this constant stressful  uncertainty about their future fate has this air of very low morale within the fort  travis general please dont take this the wrong way do you trust your men  matt i do i trust their ability i trust that theyve stayed with me in the face of all this  opposition and believe that my orders and requests to stay vigilant in 
none	 the face of such  possible destruction having been met with continued agreeance that they will follow me as  needed to our end  travis and there are none that you worry about none that have expressed a lack of confidence  none that youre keeping your eye on giving you a weird feeling  matt none that live  travis i like that answer shit  sam oi twinsies  laura oi  sam maybe you should fly up and if thordaks going to attack from the air see where the spot  is that he would attack 
none	 like a spot of weakness from above  liam well thats not a bad idea were thinking about tomorrow though as well in the morning yeah  laura maybe we should pop into syngorn  liam could you take the two of us keyleth  laura but yeah well fly up lets do that  matt all right so you guys go ahead and coast up to do what  liam to see if theres anything of use see if theres anything to be gleaned from a birdseye view  laura because its on the cliffside right  matt yeah 
none	 if you look at the large ravine that is carved through this portion of the mountain  there from your perspective looking at the map down this way it is on the western side of the  ravine against the mountain you guys coast up looking up matching the very height of the  mountain the bluff that leads down into the ravine itself and you can see over the edge the ocean of  the ozmit sea that heads off westward you can see a little bit of the light as the sun comes down to  a sunset 
dung	 you can see it glittering across the waves in the distance you can see the little  mountain range to the north of emon peering over the edge and you can see a little bit of a dark  spot in the very distance over the horizon that you can gather where emon is you can see it from  this high up even though it is but a small spot  laura sings from a distance  liam shouts what  laura shouts it looks peaceful up here  liam shouts sure  laura what are we doing do 
none	 we see anything interesting  liam not enjoying the view i start to look down around is there anything  laura that seems useful for like if we put something on the cliffside or something maybe a  hideout somewhere to hide from view something like that  liam is there anything we didnt see coming up or is it all plain to view  matt both of you guys make an investigation  laura almost awesome 19  liam 23  matt you guys take the next hour or so coasting along the edge of the mountain range the 
none	 top of  the ravine itself  laura is it a mountain  matt there are it is a mountain range and the ravine itself carves through a portion of it so  the right and left side yes  liam at the 59 minute mark i fly over and sit on the back of my sisters broom  laura is it favored terrain  matt is your favored terrain mountains  laura yeah  matt then yeah you get advantage on that  laura 20  matt but still you do have the advantage at the top of these 
none	 mountains of a wider range of view  its good for somebody whos expecting an incursion from flying creatures itd be a great  place to put a scout as a warning system should anything begin to make its way towards the fort  from emon or beyond there are places where you could in theory drop things down the edges of the  mountain that would use the ravine almost like a bowling alley essentially large boulders and  rocks which is a favored tactic of many stone giants and other giants who use mountain terrain  to their 
none	 advantage but beyond that theres no other terrain that you think would outside of you  coming up with a creative use of it theres nothing that is glaring to you as an advantage in  the coming fray  laura we could put somebody in a hideyhole up here and if they see anything they drop a stone  down to a designated area and let people know  liam yeah they could throw out one of those flarelike gemy thingies ring a bell  laura oh yeah we have those a bell is probably the best idea  
none	 liam any of those you want to take us down this broom always rides up my ass when i ride on it  laura oh because your little wings are dead  liam yes they are  laura all right ill float us down on my everflying broom  liam ow  matt okay so you guys descend  laura i go down pretty slow to make this last a little bit longer  liam getting close though yeah  laura what  liam what  laura to take out all of this  liam yeah  laura yeah  
none	 liam kill em or die trying  laura thats right  matt both of you guys make a perception check  laura oh that was so close to a one but it wasnt 20  liam 22  matt 22 okay as you guys come down  laura oh wait no 26 my math was wrong  matt thats okay as you guys come down into the bottom of the ravine you make it down safely into  fort daxio to gather with the rest of your compadres for the evening you at this point by  the way scanlan 
none	 you are currently because you have to be present to designate anybody who can  enter your mansion you are like the oneperson homeless shelter you are bringing through soldier  after soldier into there and they all look confused bewildered and many of them stop and be  like whats going on  sam name on the list whats your name  matt stuttering i am  sam name  matt stuttering are you what is  sam listen man do you want some food or not whats your name ive got a big list here  theres no 
none	 girl with you  matt trevian simtin please im hungry  sam do you have a plus one  matt i have a plus  sam youre in  matt all right one after another after another some of them seem genuinely spooked and  freaked out by the spiritual servants and avoiding them as they go on the smell of food  hits them though the eversmell of chicken cooking through does catch them and they all seem  to eventually get past their fear of the servants as the fantastic meal of relatively neutral flesh  is served 
none	 to them in your dining hall  laura theres still no veggies huh they could probably use some vegetable nutrition  sam im sure they boil the chicken in like an onion sort of water  laura do they or is it like a chicken broth that they boil them in  sam they have the fusaka now they put a little bit of that in spices it up a bit  travis theyve got a 300year supply  laughter  matt all right keyleth explain the bunker youre building for me if you could  marisha should i do 
none	 it on the inside in the courtyard make an underground pod think  fallout  matt right is it closer to the wall or closer to the actual fortress itself the entrance that  leads to the underground pathway  marisha i imagine closer to the fortress right on the inside  laura deep in there  matt so you have a gradual decline near the fortress in the courtyard that goes underneath  and then mirrors the curvature of the wall or does it travel perpendicular to it and go  underneath the wall  marisha i imagine we 
none	 wouldnt want to go underneath the wall  matt right so heres the fortress with the mountain fortress and heres the wall around it  youre essentially building it in the same curvature parallel to the outer wall  marisha yes  matt okay so you build this bunker you take the better part of the evening and probably the next  morning or so to complete whatever the spells maximum effort is  marisha yeah  matt okay cool i need you with the manpower you have possible with you taliesin go ahead  and make a tinkering check 
none	 this is going to be with strength its very large physical activity  this is less about your intellect or your manual dexterity this is about tools and having to apply  it you do have advantage because you have other men helping you with this but the dc is  relatively high  taliesin thatll do 25  matt 25 okay while the rest of you are finishing up your events of the evening and  preparing to go to sleep percy is working tirelessly into the wee hours of the morning you  finish probably like two hours 
none	 after midnight with the rest of your crew sore sweaty but you  have one functional trebuchet that looks like it could handle many many shots within one battle  and still be serviceable  liam shirtless covered in soot  marisha mmhmm  sam he wipes his brow  matt as he slowly takes his glasses off  travis yeah takes the water skin and just  matt all the soldiers are like  laura oh percy  matt there you go you guys take your evening to rest the next morning you find yourselves awake  spells restored 
none	 hit points restored allura comes in and greets all of you all right so i can  also bring us back to whitestone ive restored the teleportation spell that i had thus what do  you wish to do now  laura number one whispers never say whitestone in public ever  taliesin around us especially we could still do work here heres what has to happen now we  need to send word to as many people as possible that we are meeting here for the final  confrontation we have to make sure that work continues here and 
none	 then if theres time while  our forces assemble and things prepare we have several things we can do in the meantime  travis right keyleth is necessary to get to the feywild  laura or allura  marisha could i theoretically open a tree and send people in  laura to the feywild but how would we get back  marisha no not to the feywild if we need to see someone to  sam whitestone  marisha yeah or marquet or wherever  taliesin we have the stone as well  travis so its going to be keyleth 
none	 and one of the twinsies go to the feywild right  sam can you do any plane shifting things pikey pike  ashley i dont have it prepared  travis i dont have it  ashley i dont have it prepared  travis you know there is that fire elemental plane with the last vestige eh  taliesin we could that is absolutely on the table  marish could we do we have time for that  sam sure  taliesin its going to take us a week to get this place even remotely ready for this confrontation  matt 
none	 allura at this point by the way says a week i dont know if we have a week  travis why  taliesin what happens in less than a week  matt the minute that the information of vorugals death finds its way to thordak what do  you think is going to happen their vengeance is going to fall  taliesin its going to take a few days for that to happen to be set in motion  marisha are you kidding i dont know it could be any minute now theyve been spying on us this  whole 
none	 time what makes you think it will take a few days  sam also throwing it out there if you guys go to the feywild isnt there a chance that you  dont come back until a month later or something crazy like that doesnt time shift weirdly  matt make an intelligence check add your intelligence modifier  sam oh 18  matt 18 and you could technically add  sam i did  matt you added your d12 to it  sam oh no not my d12  matt you could use one of your bardic inspirations to 
none	 inspire yourself if you wanted to  sam sure why not ill do that all right 22 then  matt having journeyed once to the feywild and with the little bit of research youve done since  then there have been people who have been to the feywild who do speak of some sort of temporal  anomaly when traveling to and from so yes you are certain that there can be some sort of  flexibility as to the time spent there versus the time that has transpired in the prime material  plane not a sure thing but 
none	 there is some variation to that  travis whats life without a little risk  laura maybe syngorn will have control over that they can transfer back when they want to  taliesin lets see what we can do  laura they have a huge army  travis and theyve got werewolves in their woods  laura i dont know how well be able to get word to them  travis you howl  laura all right  matt allura sneaks in a bit and says my only suggestion here is make sure that you do the  things that 
none	 are absolutely necessary for this because we dont know when this is going to kick off  laura well we have to get armies here  matt then lets do it  laura thats what were trying to do  matt all right  sam well wait dont we need to send word to other places as well how do we do that  travis yeah i dont know how to reach my herd  sam isnt there a big horn you blow or something  travis no they wander to and fro  sam you could find them probably 
none	  laura they were wandering somewhere specific though into the riverlands or something  sam we can scry and find out where they are and then send someone as mistform you or something  and go catch up with them  laura well spread the fuck out and then thordak will attack and then none of us will be here  marisha all right  taliesin stop rolling thats really disconcerting when you sit there and roll at us  marisha well how do we know that thordak will even come here by the way he has no reason to 
none	  come here unless hes deliberately looking for us which we have no reason to believe that he cares  to come find us  sam quick list people quick list who do we need to contact slayers take  laura ish yeah bottom of the list because i dont think they would  sam ravenites  laura yes  liam syngorn  sam syngorn thats a big one thats a biggie right there  laura and thats a biggie because its also got these soldiers  sam the wolf pack  laura also there we can howl  travis 
none	 the herd  sam the herd  travis the platinum dragon  laura bahamut  sam jmon sa ord sort of ish  marisha weve got that thing  laura yeah weve got that whistle what about bahamuts people in vasselheim  matt thats the platinum sanctuary  laura yeah what about the platinum sanctuary  travis thats what im saying  laura oh i thought you were talking about  travis no no i said the word platinum i was there and you robbed me of it i did it right  laura sorry grog youre so smart  
none	 sam is there anyone else whos pledged their allegiance to us any other band of traveling  idiots  taliesin we could ask for help from kraghammer as well  laura yeah its so close  marisha i could ask potentially my father and the air ashari id have a hard time asking the  fire ashari theres so few of them  travis didnt the werewolves want to leave the feywild right they wanted out  laura i think so i dont know i think they just wanted out of those woods but maybe we could  find artagan 
none	 while were there maybe he could pop over and well have an archfey helping us  marisha we also have a 2000 person capacity here i mean we can always push it and make  encampments on the outside but whats our ideal number were trying to hit  sam 2000  laura a jillion as many as we can  liam it feels like its a risk but the most bang for our buck our gold piece is syngorn theres the  most people there  travis and as far as we remember the people of vasselheim their general 
none	 temperament is  vasselheim takes care of vasselheim  liam yeah thats what it felt like when we were there  matt vasselheim and the continuation of civilization and that being the dawn cradle the  city thats existed for as long as civilization has is to be protected at all costs so while  they do and can offer aid occasionally outside of it not to the detriment of their own defense  travis right  laura is that it is that everyone  travis we could go talk to that earthbreaker groon  sam where is he  
none	 laura vasselheim this is a lot of different places in like a day and a half  taliesin we could write an awful lot of letters  laura yeah and hopefully theyll show up like game of thrones at the last moment well think  were overrun and then all of a sudden another army shows up and its wonderful  marisha allura do you have some way of messaging people and sending messages like super quickly  sam an instant message app  matt actually depending on who it is  taliesin fassbender  marisha fassbender hes with wilhand 
none	  matt to be perfectly honest if its a creature that im relatively familiar with i could send it  to them instantaneously any distance across the planes  sam how many people per day  marisha across the planes  matt across the planes  sam how many times could you do that per day  matt i could probably muster it three times  laura oh this is major this is huge  liam allura did you ever meet with our father in emon  matt yes many times actually yes he was an interesting individual of the 
none	 council especially  back when sir gregory was with us but they were friends yes i did meet him  taliesin well dwell on that one well that would save us an enormous amount of energy  marisha that would be great and me two seventhlevel spells  matt sir gregory fence that was when you first came to emon hes the gentleman who was part of  the council you were hired by their father to go and inspect because he went missing  laura remember demons in the succubus house  marisha itll take me a 7thlevel spell

none	 deal with  laura theyre dicks arent they  matt no theyre just busy  laura oh that one guy we met he was a real dick though  sam any underdarky type people do they like us  liam long white hair  laura purple eyes he was in marquet is that what were thinking of am i thinking of a  different place  matt i dont know if hes a member of the arcana pansophical  laura just kidding  sam lets start with syngorn and then see how it works all right  marisha have you 
none	 ever met my father korren of the air ashari  matt ive had no correspondence from the air ashari my apologies im doing what i can  marisha yeah no youre great  taliesin youve saved us a trip to the feywild and back send word that if they can contact the  werewolves the werewolves owe us a favor i suppose not that they would help with that  matt if thats the information you need sent that would require me to make two messages just  to cover both those bases to their father  sam lets just 
none	 get the father  matt what was his name again  liam syldor  matt syldor syldor right two messages to gather the army of emon and syngorn to return  and head towards fort daxio  laura yes if they could get pop syngorn over to fort daxio thatd be killer  matt i dont know if thats how the magic works but ill put a message in there for that and to  look for werewolves  taliesin as part of the message that if theres a pack with the werewolves  sam is that vital should we 
none	 care about that  travis he fucked some shit up  sam all right sure yeah why not second message bring what was his name  travis spike  laura no  sam indala  laura no  liam michael j fox  travis ukurat  laura and marisha ukurat  matt all right and ill enquire about bringing ukurat and the werewolves all right ive got  some messaging to do  taliesin and when youre back in whitestone send the airship our way loaded with food and supplies  if you can  matt very well  laura 
none	 tell them to be on guard  sam put kima on there too  taliesin and anybody who wishes to come fight  travis kash kima  laura on the airship or send them through a tree  sam or zahra  liam when you write to our father will you tell him his children need him  travis gross  matt i can do that yes  laura i dont know if that will help at all  matt ill call for kima ill bring our allies with us either me or shaun have to stay behind to  
none	 maintain the illusion so your choice  sam shaun  travis yeah  matt all right so shaun will stay behind  sam wait  taliesin yes  laura yeah  sam thats certain death  taliesin staying in whitestone is the exact opposite of certain death  laura hes protecting everyone  matt our purpose is to stay to make sure that they do not see whitestone  taliesin that is the opposite of certain death  matt all right ill get these messages off  laura oh my god is this happening right now  matt she takes 
none	 two steps back and puts one finger in the air and as it curls her eyes glaze  over with crackling blue energy and you watch her tongue click across her mouth like shes speaking  quietly to herself her eyes come back all right ive notified your father syldor once  again her eyes glaze over with crackling blue energy her fingers trace in the air and it looks  like shes speaking  sam quick everyone hide when shes doing this so when she comes back well all be  travis yes  laura she goes back were 
none	 like  liam its like shes putting on a vr helmet  matt all right her eyes return both messages have been delivered to your father who else  should require a message  sam you dont know anyone else on our list do you the slayers take you dont know  laura it might be smart to send one to warmaster mikael as well i know hes in syngorn as well  but it might be good to have a couple of people there bringing word  liam thats not a bad idea  matt i can do that 
none	 with that once again the energy crackles and you can see shes trying to  find the location of someones presence it hits and she begins to speak quietly to herself  finishes very well the armys been notified  sam just one more message  matt let me see if she can  sam but wait what about the clasp or something  matt nope that is all that she can do actually no she can cast at a higher level so she can do more  sam the clasp do they like us or hate us  laura 
none	 they hate us but  taliesin i think that the clasp are going to be far more useful once they figure out the dragon  has left the city and i dont even think they necessarily need to be notified of such a thing  laura if the dragon leaves the city  sam all right then were good for now we just keep buffeting up this place do we have to plan  an ambush how does this work  travis we go in emon right now full ball  sam all right you and me  travis full 
none	 blush  taliesin we could go to the fire plane really quickly  liam were hoping to tempt him here  laura yeah  taliesin yes  travis why are you so anxious to go to the fire plane all of a sudden  taliesin theres an object its from the fire plane we are facing a fire dragon which means  its something unbelievably useful or not useful at all we need ice weapons we need cold weapons  and we dont have any  marisha and you think that were going to find those in the fire plane 
none	  taliesin either that or in that ship that we left behind  matt you have knowledge of dragons quite well actually vex you do know that red dragons are  not vulnerable to cold by any means theyre just resistant to fire  laura theyre just resistant to fire  taliesin so it doesnt matter then  laura are they vulnerable to anything that i know of  travis insults cheese  ashley love  marisha peanuts  travis bruised bananas  matt laughs bruised bananas  travis hey pike did you know that we have all the vestiges 
none	 except for the one in the fire plane  and youll never guess what it is  ashley what is it  travis what is it i forgot  sam some plate armor  travis its some plate armor  laura of the dawn martyr  ashley what  laura which might be clutch for you  ashley that might be a long i dont know allura was saying we dont have time  sam one day whats one day  marisha you dont know if its going to be one day  sam well when we get there well 
none	 find out if its taking too long well pop back these  messages are going to take a while to deliver  marisha im not like a wonkavator man  laura wed have to spend the night there  ashley that makes me a little nervous  sam all right one night theyve all eaten today were fine  matt as far as you know no there is no vulnerability  laura fuck really  matt just fine with fire  travis just pure death and destruction  taliesin well at least thats a bonus in that means that anything 
none	 will work as well as anything else  travis thats true  laura right  liam can we go back to the plan about how we intend to get thordak here we were playing with  the idea of fooling thordak into thinking that raishan had been killed  taliesin raishan was going to feed him the information that he thought that we were here and  then vanish  liam and thats it we think thats going to pull him out  taliesin i think raishan will be clever enough to give him just enough to get him here 
none	  liam do you think raishan would be willing to let us hack off a little bit of flesh to send  laura youd have to ask raishan  taliesin youd have to ask raishan she might be willing to let me do such a thing  travis did we establish a way to contact her  marisha we have no way to contact her  sam no wait didnt we send her on a mission  travis oh we did she was checking on  sam she was going to bring us back some dude and were not even 
none	 there  laura oh fuck asum was going to come back  sam to not where we are right now  laura fuck  travis it was two things it was asoon and  liam asoon  travis bassoon whatever and what was the other thing  laura some other guy was it some other guy  travis oh shit nails  sam the last time we talked to raishan she said all right ill be back in a day and then we  got out of there  laura well its still a day it hasnt been a day 
none	 yet we havent spent the night here yet  sam yeah no we havent spent the night yet  travis oh she was going to emon to hold up the bluff that everything was cool was thordak right  she was going to bluff and then she was also going to try to bring back seeker asum  taliesin its all right we can head home from here someone has got to go home  laura somebodys got to go  marisha some of us can go and some of us can stay  laura well all right  sam 
none	 all right ill go talk to raishan  liam and you cant leave because youre building or can you go  taliesin i can leave weve got one working if i stay ill have two working if i stay longer  ill have three working but ill go where were most useful  ashley but you want a chunk of her or like a little piece of her  liam something like a claw or something to drop at thordaks feet itll help with the bluff  marisha what makes you think that he would lead the charge to come 
none	 find us in his eyes he could  just send one of his peons to come smash us  travis thordak  marisha yeah  taliesin hes sent all of his dragons and nothings worked  laura thats the goal we kill the peons and then he comes  taliesin and the more he sends the more we kill  travis what if we go mess up something on the edge of emon and then were like yeah fuck you  and then we take off or like bamf back  taliesin i dont believe hell suffer that much indignity 
none	  marisha if we tell thordak where we are hell probably come with that wyvern army that almost  took out whitestone correct  laura thats why we need to have a lot of people here to fight them  travis yeah to balance that out  taliesin and that also means that the clasp will have an opportunity to take back the city  marisha while hes gone  taliesin if he leaves with his army yes if he leaves his army to actually manage the city  laura thats what we talked about  taliesin either way its 
none	 stretching him thin  travis is it a bit of a practice round if we go to the fire plane lets say we get there and its  a total shit show right nothing but death waiting for us we change our mind we leave but  at least we see where thordaks been all this time  marisha and the other thing that we could glean from the fire realm is possibly figuring out a  little bit more about the connection he had with it and to the heart stone ember seed thing  laura all right allura 
none	 can you send a message to gilmore or cassandra or kima even maybe just  those three theyre the only ones who know about raishan let them know that raishan is bringing  back asum  taliesin they were there  laura i know but just to make sure everythings fine with that  matt i can do that yes  sam and then were going to the fire plane  travis yeah just give it a looksee  sam just pop on down for a bit to the basement  travis yeah ive got a timeshare there it will 
none	 be killer  marisha id like to bring raishan with us to the fire plane  sam no fucking way  laura no what are we going to do shes not going to come  taliesin shes not going to come to the fire plane  marisha she knows it better than anybody else  taliesin shes not going to come to the fire plane but youre right she does if i were her i  wouldnt come  laura would you want to go allura  matt what to the fire plane i mean i can my skills are 
none	 probably better used elsewhere but  whatever you think is wisest  taliesin we need agents on the ground right now  travis true  laura all right  taliesin things need to move forward here  laura okay then you stay here and keep running things  taliesin if opportunities present themselves to bring more people here or to gather more allies  take them  sam lets pop on down  marisha my gosh you guys the dawn martyr is in the city of brass which im pretty sure is  overrun with fire elementals  travis its 
none	 just a myth though right and that was probably written a long time ago which  means shit could have totally changed  sam plus now we have a lot of money we can buy our way through the fire plane  taliesin that works  laura is this stupid are we going to die in the fire plane  liam i think its a bad idea i dont think we have time  travis never tell me the odds  laura but theres a vestige there for pike  marisha i mean we can go we can hit the 
none	 fire ashari first and see if cerkonos is there and  maybe see if cerkonos wants to help us out  liam if were all alive in two weeks id be happy to go and get armor for pike but theres dragons  on top of our backs right now  marisha allura youre certain as soon as he finds out about vorugals death that hes going to  seek retribution  matt im not certain but as soon as he found out about umbrasyls thats when he sent things  looking for us near whitestone that was when vorugal 
none	 and the rest of the armies swept through  that was two days after umbrasyls fall  liam weve also totally spilled our spaghetti with raishan shes not going to wait shes going  to push things forward i dont think we have time  travis all right vax do you have a suggestion in place then  liam i think that we talk to raishan these two chuckleheads convince her to let us take a pound  of her flesh or ten somehow dump it insultingly at thordaks feet and brace for the worst  travis im okay with 
none	 that but how do we get in touch with her  sam we can get in touch with her when she goes back to the place that shall not be named but all  of that is going to take days and we cant do that until the armies have arrived here in fort  daxio which could take another few days i dont know where syngorn lands when it comes back to  this plane i assume its not next door theyre going to take days to get here  laura the thing is thordaks going to send out 
none	 looksees like he did over whitestone as soon as  he finds out umbrasyl is dead it doesnt mean hell launch an attack because where is he going  to attack he doesnt know where we are  sam yeah and if hes searching for us what better place to be than on a different plane  travis lets go to a different plane  marisha do you think he went to the place which shall not be named because raishan tipped him off  that we were there  travis and taliesin no  marisha why did he go 
none	 to the place that shall not be named then why did he look there  travis vorugal  taliesin it was a place to be looked at and they flew over and didnt see it  marisha you think they were just scanning  taliesin i do  sam all in favor of the fire plane say aye  sam and travis aye  sam that was only two wow thats pretty rough  travis no that was four theyre pansies and wont say anything with their voice  ashley i dont know  sam all in favor of staying 
none	 say cooter  taliesin thats not fair  sam two to one  travis lets go even if it sucks we can just come right back  laura we just bamf right back  marisha we can always come back and i would like to maybe see if we could find out more about the  ember seed fire plane  liam i mean theres nothing else we can do today is there  travis right no  sam feed more soldiers  taliesin supplies are on the way soldiers are on the way  travis cows eat hay  
none	 taliesin do what you can cows eat hay neigh neigh hey so we say  liam gather ye rosebuds while ye may vox machina is dying  laura if you hear back from anyone in syngorn or anyone anywhere will you send us a message  matt yes and i will notify the general of these plans before i head on that way very well good luck  laura pretend like we were never here let them know pretend like we were never here  matt understood  laura all right  matt stay safe friends she turns and leaves 
none	 the room  laura we are so stupid this is going to be fun  taliesin yes i love it  travis do we hold hands again  marisha oh boy  laura no its a tree stride  marisha nope well okay if we are  liam and sam plane shift  marisha hang on do we want to stop off at the fire ashari and pick up cerkonos i think its  not a bad idea  sam no  marisha we are not going to bring along our ally who knows the fire plane better than anyone 
none	 alive  laura no i think we should because they were there  liam yeah and you said we can instantaneously jump over grab him and shift  marisha once i tree stride we can theres that portal there and we can go through the portal  travis yeah yeah i am a big fan of the tour guide  marisha the tour guide all right were going to tree stride to the fire ashari  matt all right most of the trees near or within the courtyard of the fort are thin and maybe like  a foot to 
none	 a half a foot wide and  ashley get skinny get skinny  matt you did see that cluster of brownishred forest canopy across the ravine but thats the  only real  marisha across the ravine  matt yeah on the opposite side  travis lets hoof it i need to stretch my legs anyway  marisha well how big was the ravine like crossing the grand canyon  sam how long to get there  matt its about a third of the width of the grand canyon maybe its a big ravine  laura can you plane shift 
none	 us over to the ashari it has to be to another plane  marisha it has to be to another plane  liam scanlan can you turn us into a bunch of hummingbirds or something  sam i can turn a couple of us into some things  laura just something little so that we can pop to the tree  sam you two can fly right  matt it would take you a handful of hours to walk to this  laura oh yeah so lets fucking do it  travis told you  matt at a brisk pace 
none	 on foot youll get there in three hours  travis i put pike on my shoulders because im getting ready for my rocky training montage  taliesin well get as many of us on the carpet as possible  marisha groans rip the carpet  taliesin you should feel bad  liam i should feel bad  matt all right you guys eventually make your way to the outside of the forest here in the othendin  pass you can see its a living forest but the trees themselves it looks like there was a  waterfall that actually breaks 
dung	 down off the top of the cliff that comes down and forms a small pool  most of its dried up but the ground here is damp and the forest does seem to exist in this  climate however a lot of the leaves have turned and theyre hitting the delayed end of winter a  few months after the winters crest festival you find a number of trees that are perfectly  serviceable for your spellcasting you guys wait as keyleth completes her ritual you can see the  tree suddenly shifts open on the opposite end you can 
dung	 see the caldera itself where the pyrah ashari  exist on the top of this mountainous volcano you all step through and find yourself now on the  cracked dark ashen ground landscape amongst the various rocklike structures that house their  people you can see the cinder grove in the distance nowhere near as tumultuous as the last  time you encountered it and you now stand amongst the remaining pyrah you do now see the survivors  that you met earlier and a few other survivors that previously had not been found have gathered  and whereas previously 
none	 you only thought maybe a little over 20 existed it looks like maybe  theres a good 50 or 60 that actually are beginning to rebuild the fire ashari  taliesin were going to blow it up again woo table flip  laura look at that keyleth theres so many more people than you thought  marisha theres still kids  matt like two  marisha like two kids one of those days they might grow up  taliesin were going to take like 20 of them to the fight and theyll be fine  marisha nervous laughter come on 
none	 kids have a sword  liam thats a big if  matt it doesnt take you long to find cerkonos who at this point in time has regrown his arm  marisha yeah i knew hed be all right  matt he approaches now his darkened skin tattooed his long hair past his shoulders he  approaches with an expression of surprise and mild confusion it is good to to see all of you i  ask what brings you to the doorstep of the pyrah ashari  marisha cerkonos thordak has taken over emon and in the time that 
none	 he has broken out of the fire  plane it seems there is a certain magic that is allowing him to essentially turn emon into a  second fire plane we believe he still has some sort of connection here based on the binding magic  that was used on him in the past something called an ember seed have you heard of this  matt this does not stir my memory reserves im sorry  marisha do you remember if raishan when she was moving in and out of the fire plane do you  remember her mentioning anything 
none	 about it or anything suspicious about wanting to learn about  the connection to the fire plane  matt there were inquiries yes i was surprised by one so young seemingly to be so interested in  the inner and outer planes and their interactions she found much of her time in solace in the cinder  grove she was not quick to pick up the druidic magics but her research was in depth she spoke  with many elders myself included  marisha where is the cinder grove did we pass through the cinder grove  matt the cinder 
none	 grove is in the center of the caldera thats the petrified forest that is  surrounding where the actual tear in the boundary is where the fire ashari hold vigil  laura wasnt the ember seed connected to the didnt we knock down some pillars when we came to  the fire plane the last time isnt that part of the reason his hold was broken  marisha it was opened more the portal got weak when it was around the solstice  laura right but remember we were here for your  marisha we fought cerkonos who was essentially 
none	 a giant elemental i dont remember us breaking  anything  matt no when you first came here it was part of your aramente and you guys just passed through  the tear and you battled cerkonos and the other druids in elemental form as part of a test there  was some stones on the other side but there was nothing  laura okay maybe you just thought that and were freaking out a bit  marisha yeah i got a little panicky at one point yeah thordak was connected by the soul gem  and we know he 
none	 busted through you know the fire plane better than anyone we are also looking for  the plate of dawnmartyr in the city of brass  matt when you say the city of brass you watch his demeanor change his arms cross and he leans  back into himself that is not a place for the ashari it is a place of tyranny and greed it is  a unique mix of those who exist there and if you are intent on going i am happy to escort you but  it is a different experience than we are used 
none	 to and perhaps yourself as well  laura is it a large city  matt it is quite big yes  taliesin this is the direst of situations extreme measures must be taken  matt the choice is yours you have come this far  marisha how long is the journey to the city of brass  matt from the tear it is about three days foot travel your plane shift spell can bring you  directly to a location as long as youre aware of it  marisha right  sam we can go right there be right in 
town	 the center of the city land right in main street next to  the reebok store  liam i have a sweater ive hidden it in manhattan go find it  laughter  matt yeah  travis lets do it  laura it feels like its going to be really hard  travis i mean everything we do is right i mean every time weve faced a dragon we go find another  vestige it feels like the rhythm is right on this lets go  marisha heres the worstcase scenario though were gone we come back thordak has obliterated 
none	  everything including fort daxio  sam yeah but good news were still alive  travis were alive highfive scanlan  taliesin the stones dont work across planes do they  liam the gatestones no  taliesin but alluras ability to send messages does  matt this is true from what she said yes  taliesin so if things start going very haywire we can let her know that she is to call us  immediately and we will drop what were doing  sam she could probably figure that out on her own  laura yeah whatever were doing 
none	 even if were in the middle of fighting some really big fire  elementals we just  taliesin plane shift  liam of course wed have to get a message to her to tell her that  sam she would probably figure that out  travis yeah shell figure it out and weve got an amazing tour guide its set up for us  cant fail 0 apr  liam you big lovable lug i still think its a very bad idea ill go if you all want to go  matt cerkonos turns to you grog and says i 
none	 do not mean to be misunderstanding i will take you  to the city but i will not enter it  travis yeah im good with that i mean youll take us there right youll give us a couple of  warnings maybe point at something if its terrible and then youve got to go because its  going to mess with you  matt i am of no use in that city  travis now why is that like youve got feelings about it or youre afraid of it or youll be  powerless there  matt most of 
none	 all of that  travis powerless  matt there are many powerful entities that exist in the city i am not a man for cultured places  travis youve been before  matt ive been near  sam lets just pop in pop out guys what could go wrong  taliesin were gathering forces at fort daxio to fight this dragon and if you can lend any of your  power or have any power you can send wed be forever grateful  marisha do you think you could reach out to korren  matt i could how soon  
none	 taliesin soon that is where we will head immediately when we are done here  matt all right then i will lead you if you choose to go to this city and then i will call  for your father we will send what we can spare  marisha well if you dont want to go inside i can plane shift us there we dont necessarily  need you i guess i mean we need you but im wondering if youd be better here  matt no offense taken if you wish to continue your journey i can go and 
none	 try and round up the  ashari that can fight  sam lets do that  marisha do you know anything of where thordak was held  matt i did not know thordak existed until he tore through our people so unfortunately not  marisha is there anyone here left that raishan spoke to the most a confidant someone who might  have been aiding her  matt its hard to tell many who were near those discussions were slain im sorry  marisha well thats fair  travis were good  laura scanlan will you be able to do 
none	 the mansion inside of the fire plane or did you already use it  sam sure right i can do my magic wherever i have no idea ive never been to the fire plane  laura no i mean but did you already use it today  sam no i used it yesterday  matt correct you would still have the ability to use it today  taliesin all right i think weve done an enormous amount towards getting prepared for this  laura does everything over there fight with fire  matt not everything but many things there have 
none	 fire by nature or at least the ability to live  among it there are many parts of the fire plane that you should not traverse it would destroy you  immediately  laura the city of brass sucks but well be okay going there ish  matt its one of the few places that can support a city so yes  liam kind of hot  matt it is very hot there the longer you stay the more difficult it is for such frail beings as  us to exist  travis speak for yourself  laura in and 
none	 out  travis pull the trigger travel agent  marisha lets do this shit  matt stay safe i will see you soon at this fort daxio  laura thank you so much  sam this was a worthwhile trip already  liam im setting my armor to fire resistance  ashley is there anything else we need to know to be safe to look out for while were there  matt nothing which you havent already seen just know there are many denizens there that enjoy  the tyranny so be careful dont start any wars  laura can 
none	 i say while this whole talks been going on that ive been unattuning my coldsnap armor and  reattuning my bracers of archery  matt sure it will take you guys a short rest to do all that plus with your reattune there you  guys take a short rest while cerkonos takes a couple of the other nearby pyrah with him and they  head off towards the cinder grove presumably to communicate with your father  marisha cool  laura can i ask you a question  matt yes  laura if i have two bows that are 
none	 awesome and im attuned to both of them how easy is it to  switch in a battle  matt if you have two bows that are attuned to you  laura yeah if i chose to attune to the sky sentinel and fenthras instead of the bracers  matt i mean its possible but the idea of having one wielded and one on your back pulling  it out youre not proficient and fast in bowdrawing  laura itd be an action to switch them out in a battle  matt maybe probably you could drop one but then 
none	 pulling the other one out getting it around  you arrow out it would probably take you an action  laura cool  sam lets just go man  travis yeah im standing there with my eyes closed and my hands out  laura hey that all happened in a millisecond i was considering things in my brain  travis im showing my willingness to go  marisha lets go city of brass yo  matt all right so focusing on the city of brass you all gather hands as keyleth concentrates you  feel the already warm air of 
none	 the cauldron of this volcanic mountain you feel a blast of heat  surround you this whirlwind of hot air that causes your eyes to close instinctually you feel  the edges of your skin the hairs begin to curl your brows begin to singe as you close your eyes  instinctually you open them again and looking around you see a familiar broken landscape of  shattered stone rock reddish and ironlike in coloration you see various stone obelisks that  are jutting out of the ground from broken and at some points seismic earth that had been pushed 
none	 up  from underneath where gouts of flame occasionally spill out and burst into the sky the air itself  carries a sulfuric and ionized scent to it you can see darkened clouds of smoke and soot that  slowly shift in the distance way off towards the horizon almost the equivalent of a darkened storm  in the distance except its a sheet of roaring fire just taking up an entire quarter of the  skyline miles and miles away from you you dont know if its coming closer or further away but  its frightening as you glance 
town	 over your shoulder you see behind you a glimmer of whatever  source of light this land takes into itself reflecting off of dozens upon dozens of reflective  metallic buildings and towers and domes and one large dark metal wall that surrounds the  exterior you see upon this what you assume to be the city of brass and thats where were going to  go ahead and take a break  travis and marisha shit  matt be right back here in a few minutes  laura oh right with the announcement of our winners  matt it 
none	 might be a little bit of a longer break well be back here shortly guys be patient see  you in a minute  break  matt welcome back ladies and gentlemen before we get into the game were going to go ahead and  announce our winners for the critical costumes contest we ran  cheering  matt once again every costume put out there was fantastic seriously you guys it was one of  the coolest things to see a bunch of characters in our silly little dd game realized physically  by other people is crazy  
none	 liam its also i amass everything and i couldnt get in all the awesome even into what we put into  the slideshow in the episode and in the gallery on geek  sundry today there were so many good  costumes and were blown away by i mean it was a massive amount  marisha a lot came in at the eleventh hour too so if you didnt see yours in the slideshow we  still probably saw but that would be why  laura yeah because weve been looking at the hashtag like crazy  matt which by

none	 the sky locked in that reddishorange atmosphere above you you look around as the wind  picks up the heat carrying ash and black soot through forcing you to wince and keep your eyes  somewhat closed you immediately begin to pull scarves up in front to try and filter this  aggressive and caustic air  marisha im going to go ahead and cast protection from energy on myself with fire  sam good for you  laura yeah right its a concentration spell or else i wouldve taken it too you cant do it with  anything else 
town	  matt looking as to where that giant wall of fire across the horizon is you see it begin to merge  closer and closer the edge of that sea until eventually it comes to the city of brass which  you see behind you this large amazing vast city of various reflective metallic surfaces you  see pointed spires round domes and hundreds and hundreds of these buildings that sprawl out beyond  the wall that you see on the outside of it what would you guys like to do  travis before we go any farther if we 
none	 want to pull the ripcord what does that look like  sam what do you mean if we want to go back  travis yeah  marisha we have to i think be in a fairly safe space and give me a minute  travis one minute  marisha let me double check before i say that  sam are we already backing out of this grog  travis no im making sure that were not like oh weve got to go oh shit  marisha nope i lied its instantaneous  travis but we all got to be touching 
none	  marisha me and up to eight willing creatures who link hands in a circle  laura ashley and travis okay  laura whats our jenga  marisha yeah whats our code word  sam super jenga  laura super jenga means everybody run towards each other and link hands  liam so jenga means i fucked up my name is vax and super jenga means we have to link hands  and bounce  travis duck duck goose means its playtime  laura yeah  sam lets walk into the city of brass  travis yeah  matt all 
none	 right as you guys begin stepping towards this and it is hard to gauge distance on  this citys size even from just arriving in this placethe more you walk the slower its arrival  comes as you begin to take in the sheer immensity of its sprawling expanse you see little  occasional bursts of flame off from the opposite side of the wall some small shapes coasting over  a little glow pass and as you get close enough im going to have everyone roll a perception check  travis i got this you guys  laura 27 
none	  marisha 25  taliesin 15  liam 27  travis 12  sam bullshit over here  ashley 21  travis 12  matt okay keyleth what did you get  marisha 25  matt 25 and you got  taliesin 15  matt all right so keyleth and the twins you guys looking ahead youre beginning to see these  darkish shapes moving towards the edge of one of the first gates that you notice amongst the  reflective surface of the outer wall it is a solid door like two large doors that are affixed  to 
none	 each other with a crosschain circumstance you see six figures currently mounting shifting and  walking along the side of the wall as you get closer still you can make out they look humanoid  two arms two legs its hard to make out their size in respect to where you are and in paying  attention as you approach you do notice that some of them have varying shades of colored skin they  wear loose silk outfits wide baggy airfilled pants with long robes or vests that dangle below  muscular the skin on a few of them 
none	 appears to be deep crimson or orangishred two of them the  skin actually almost goes to more like a black a deep soot and ash color you begin to see more  details in the skin you see horns and large fangs from underneath you see large scimitarlike  blades to the side youve seen one of these creatures before it emerged from the tear in the  fire plane last time you were there there are six efreeti that are currently standing guard outside  of the gate to the city  liam genies  laura basically theyre 
none	 really powerful  ashley theyre very smart  sam think we can talk to them  travis yes lets parlay  laura should we go and talk to them  travis only one should talk  sam why are you all looking at me  liam because you have the gift of gab  laura you are really good go talk to them scanlan be super cool  sam greetings hello hi there  travis oh shit youre doing it  matt as you say this haphazardly from the distance you see three of them all of a sudden  
none	 their attention right over in your direction two of them immediately begin to lift up off the  ground and their legs vanish into a plume of flame and smoke as they whoosh almost like rockets in  the sky heading over in your direction the other one goes into a run towards you  laura oh jesus  sam are they attacking  liam and matt you dont know  laura i keep a hand on the bow just in case  matt okay  ashley and laura steady  matt as you all very nervously sit there and 
none	 wait the two that are cruising through the sky go  slamming into the ground to the immediate right and left of scanlan not far from you guys  leaving these small craters the flaming smoke the lower portion of their body poofs outward  scattering ash as you see now their legs muscular and thick like trunks of reddishblack muscle  they both stand and glance downward at this tiny little gnome by comparison each of them standing  about ten to 12 feet in full height  laura oh fuck  marisha the efreetis  matt the efreetis 
none	  laura theyre so big  matt the one thats running eventually catches up to you and slows his gait and puts his hands  behind his back puts his chin up and begins walking you can see now he has these two long  tufts of black hair that are braided into this long braid that floats gently as the heated breeze  continues to blow past you as he begins to approach he looks out among the rest of your  group and then down at this tiny gnome that has stepped up to greet them  sam 
none	 we request passage into your city  matt what is your business  sam we are travelling salespeople and we are here to sell our wares  matt what wares are you here to sell  sam one item in particular which could be of much value to the people in your city  matt then show me this item of value  sam i dont think you want to see it  matt then you dont want to enter the city  sam all right its a pet of ours that weve been travelling with its right back there 
none	 and i  point behind us to an empty space  matt he glances over towards the empty space  sam you dont see it oh i forgot weve made it invisible let me drop the spell and i will cast  major image and i am making a goristro right behind us that looks a lot like yenk because  thats the only one ive ever seen  laughter  travis oh i love you  sam 20 feet tall snarling growling just a fucking nightmare  matt okay so is it just standing there snarling  sam yeah 
none	 looking real mean and ornery with spit coming off of him  matt okay all right at this point the three efreeti are glancing in that direction first off  go ahead and make a deception check  liam this is the weirdest day  laura ever  sam 28  marisha you dont think the day when we were cows was far weirder that was pretty weird  matt they glance over they all very intensely inspect from a distance this goristro that has now  appeared that is snarling approximately how far away from you the range is 
none	 120 feet in the spell  sam lets say 60 feet back  matt all right the central one looks to the efreet to his left or to the right of you gives  him a nudge and that efreeti that efreet begins to step away  sam ah ah ah you dont get to touch our pet please allow us entry to your city and we will find  someone who can afford to touch him  matt hmm the efreet that you halted takes a few more steps not paying heed as the one thats  in front 
none	 of you goes so youre looking to sell this as a servant this beast will work as a  servant or does it work in servitude  sam it works for me for the moment and i can get it to work for someone else for a price but  if your man goes over there hes going to die because i will tell my goristro to kill him  matt hmph it is rare to see something so small able to control something so vicious and  dangerous and you see him leaning in now closer to you you 
none	 see these tiny little burning beads of  red flame as the center of his eyes against a black iris you see as he gets closer the grin  begins to curl across the rows and rows of sharpened white gleaming teeth he says you  such a small easytocrush creature can seem to hold dominion over something that exists in places  that would rend your mind asunder  taliesin i reach into the bag and im going to grab a little chunk of dragon and a chunk of the  previous goristro that we still have some bits 
none	 of and drop them in front of him on the ground  matt dull thud sniff  sam those were my other pets  matt slurping spitting he throws them to the ground he begins speaking in a language that you  dont understand it sounds very much like the slow rolling firebursts of magma pouring down  the side of a mountain  laura what is it  marisha can i recognize it as a druid who has spent time as a fire elemental  matt you recognize the type it is the same language spoken by the fire 
none	 elementals but you do  not speak the language but the efreet that stepped away has stopped and is taking a moment to  look from about a 40foot distance from the goristro  laura distressed sounds  matt loud sniff and begins walking back toward the other efreeti the one before you whose face  is still up in front of you is reading you his head is about the size of your entire body and he goes  sam ill put my hands behind my back and stand up a little taller to meet him  matt if 
none	 you wish to walk the city then pay the toll  sam how much would the toll be  matt how much do you think the toll is worth  sam vex  matt if the toll is insufficient and i find offense at the offer then you will have bigger  problems than entry but generosity goes a long way  laura so like money is it money then  sam the money that we carry with us is from a faroff land will it still be good here its  gold and platinum  laura or would you 
none	 rather gems  matt gems are good as well money is money we work and deal with many creatures from many places  here what do you offer  laura should i just you know what fuck it im going to put the 20pound bag of gems in his hand  matt he takes it and closes the fingers of his hand around it then shakes it a little and listens  sam 20 pound  matt he begins to pour the gems out he takes a very keen look at them  travis who are you and what have 
none	 you done with vex  laura the world is fucking ending you guys how else am i going to use these things  sam who are you right now  matt he pulls the tiny drawstring taut once again may you enjoy your time in the city of  brass now i suggest your wineskins be full and he turns around and the efreeti all begin to walk  away towards the entrance to the city  sam loudly and conspicuously i say stanley invisible and then he poofs away  laura scanlan i think you let a little bit 
none	 of scry on the ground there  sam lets just get in the city and buy me some new pants  taliesin i pick up the dragon scales and put them back in the bag  liam stan lee voice greetings true believers  travis we pick up the dragon parts and we move into the city  taliesin that was a very good call  laura fuck  sam i throw up a little  ashley you did really well  taliesin always tip the doorman  liam im patting scanlan on the back and wiping his mouth  
none	 sam great now were inside this stupid city now what do we need to find a wall  marisha no we have to hang on lets do a quick refresher on the impossible needle we have  to find in this haystack  laura oh wait because i took a spell  sam a find item anywhere spell  laura locate object  sam holy fucking shit  marisha hang on hold i brought that spell as well  laura oh okay  marisha it has to be within 1000 feet 1000 feet isnt a whole lot in this really 
none	 large metropolis  correct  travis we go to the front door we do it once go to the middle we do it again totally covered  sam if you guys go 2000 feet apart thats essentially a mile spread  laura right how many miles is the city  matt you have no idea you havent walked inside youve got no idea  taliesin we are walking towards the door what do we know  marisha so wait theres a beacon of protection for the chosen of pelor it is gathering dust on a  wall somewhere in the 
none	 city of brass it was a trophy won by a fire giant in a card game from the  suutan bloodline that once donned it  travis fuck we got to go find  marisha it could be hanging on a pub wall somewhere correct  travis no its a trophy its too valuable to be in a pub  marisha do we know where fire giants might hang out or anything about the suutan bloodline  travis its on somebodys wall as a trophy  laura maybe we should ask somebody  marisha i mean it could be in 
none	 a nobles house for all we know  liam do we see anyone who looks remotely like us whos not from the fire plane here  matt well youre just now approaching the front gates where the six efreeti currently stand as  the three that have returned the central one takes his hand up and does this with his finger  and as he does you watch as the crisscross chains that hold the gate shut suddenly shift and  you watch dust and ash get shaken free from the chains as theyre all suddenly pulled upward  through 
none	 these rings to the very top and the doors shift open very slowly giving just enough  space for people of your physical width to pass through grog you have to squeeze a little  taliesin good sir one question before we enter your city since you are such a good friend and we  look forward to possibly being friends again someday where would one find people who enjoy the  sport of watching large creatures battle if you could think of such a thing  matt laughs welcome to the city of brass  taliesin i love your 
none	 answer  matt as you guys walk in the doors close behind and you watch as the chains that were pulled  free that now dangle loosely automatically on their own strike up like snakes instantly and  flash back through on the other side you can hear them retying themselves between the ringloops to  seal off the doorway once again  liam we are in a city where everyone is going to despise us  laura not necessarily act really fucking tough dude  marisha yeah everyone wants to kick our ass  travis should we get some 
town	 jail tattoos before we continue  scanlan i can make us all look really rough and ragged  taliesin i think theres a lot of magic here well no lets  matt so as you say lets and it trails off you all take a moment to look into the city around  you marquet offered ankharel a very beautiful city of ornate culture this city has been around  far longer and has been constructed by far more intricate artisans since you see hundreds of  buildings of different sizes all constructed from various types of materials many of 
town	 them metallic  and brass or bronze in color reflecting the everpresent sunlight from the sky you can see  buildings carved from dark black obsidian from other forms of darkened stone you can see natural  rock formations of blackened rock and stone jutting outward where crafted from that you can  see communities of maybe dozens of buildings and homes that have been constructed from it you can  see towers that are impossibly high hundreds of feet up in the sky some broken from previous  conflicts and never constructed since you can see a series of 
none	 streets that intertwine out before you  with these tiny little cobblestones that all seem to have a matching ruddy brownish earth tone  with a dusting of ash and red earth scattered across them you see throughout here human beings  occasionally you see dozens upon dozens of efreeti walking around crusted with jewelry and  wearing fine robes and linens you can begin to notice quickly that many of these efreeti walk along with  some of these humans these humans walk at their sides some in chains  all oh shit  matt you can see a 
none	 number of individuals pedaling small carts through also in comparable levels of  enslavement but not all are enslaved there are individuals from other areas youve never  recognized various features you see two humanoids that walk around by themselves their  features are human but not theres something about them thats a little off but you cant  quite pick up what and they walk off in the distance there is a gathering of many cultures  that make their way through here but definitely the dominant culture here appears to be one ruled  by the elemental fire 
none	 djinn that youve already encountered  liam the servants the humans and i dont know if theres any elves dwarves halflings or anything  in the mix but people who are not from here how does their health appear  matt fine if perpetually uncomfortable in the current weather which is for the record were  hitting somewhere between 110°f to 120°f in the air at all times here id say actually in fact  at this time id like everyone to make a constitution saving throw  marisha do i get advantage because of the fire resist  matt 
none	 youre fine and actually you having fireresistant armor i would say you do not have  to make it vax you feel naturally more comfortable in here based on the resistance youve  given your enchantment  marisha do i have to roll or am i good to go  matt no youre fine  taliesin six im going to use one of my resolves  matt okay  taliesin and slightly better 15  laura 15  ashley seven  travis 19  matt okay for the time youve been here its been an unwelcoming atmosphere but not one 
none	 that  has been so harsh as to press down upon your physical constitution you all seem to withstand  the current atmosphere for now but you do gather that the longer you are here the more difficult  it will be to endure this atmosphere without detrimental effect  marisha i meant to note i wanted to put my ring of protection on and put the cloak away when we  took that short rest i dont know if i said that out loud  matt you did not say that out loud  marisha can i do that 
none	 now  matt sure  marisha and it takes some time  matt its fine so what do you wish to do now that youve gained entry into the city of brass  laura lets find that armor  travis keep walking lets keep walking and see what we see  laura yeah we walk the fuck forward should we get a little farther into the city or should i  cast it right now  taliesin i think the citys huge  marisha hang on how long does that spell last  taliesin thats the other question  marisha 
none	 grog could you recognize fire giants if you saw one are they akin to stone giants  travis i dont think so i dont think ive ever seen one  matt you have not seen a fire giant in person in all the time that youve spent on this plane  travis i bet i can pick it out though if its giant and its made of fire  marisha and youre like thats a fire giant all right yeah totally  taliesin ten minutes and the other question is if you can change into a flying creature  liam 
town	 are there any humans around right now who look like theyre not slaves who look welloff  relatively  matt right now you have not encountered any youve literally just walked into the city and  this is your first glance at the first street that youve encountered as you guys begin to walk  farther into the city one thing that you do notice too is there are these stationary torches  that meet at various crossroads and at the top of these torches there is a ball of flame that is  flickering and shooting off spurts here 
none	 and there and every now and then you hear one go flaring  in the distance and thats what you were seeing on the other side of the wall these flames cause  this dancing light source effect throughout the entire city due to the vastly metallic nature of  the building construct here and so as you  sam sorry  laura oh wow that might be the worst shirt youve ever worn on the show  sam yeah im out of shirts guys  74 fucking shirts how many do i own 74  liam and laura wow 
none	  laura youll be shirtless  liam im bringing you a new shirt for your birthday man  travis and ashley okay i farted it was me  liam holy moly bring it back people im specifically looking for a human who is not a  slave who looks reasonably well off  taliesin im looking for social gatherings pubs and otherwise  marisha im going to talk to vex as soon as we get a hot second whenever that falls  matt okay so as you guys are walking keeping your eyes out before yourselves you guys engage  
none	 in conversation as you continue into the city  marisha all right so we both have the locate object spell it lasts for ten minutes and we can  both fly we could both cast it and maybe do like a perimeter run maybe  sam wait how long does it last  marisha laura and taliesin ten minutes  sam we can get a long fucking way in ten minutes  marisha yeah if were flying  laura as long as you know nothing attacks us right thats clutch  marisha well i could also potentially polymorph into something 
none	 or beast shape into something  that has there been any type of creatures  laura flying creatures here  travis in the air  laura maybe wyverns or something  matt you havent seen any at the moment you have seen so far efreeti being capable of  flight both from your previous encounter and the two at the gate that just jettisoned off in your  direction before landing  marisha okay are they considered humanoidish to where i could alter self to look like an efreeti  laura a teeny tiny efreeti  marisha teeny teeny efreeti 
none	 no  matt no from your alter self ability no they are far too different in size physiology and  appearance to pass off as an efreet  marisha are there any humanoids like like  taliesin a fire elemental  marisha or like dragonborn or like whats the thing that zahra is im drawing a blank right now  sam wyverns lizardpeople  laura tieflings  marisha tieflings are there like any tieflings around  matt you can keep an eye out as you continue walking forward you dont see any yet  marisha i want to look for 
none	 the most unsubjugated humanoids  matt okay so you keep an eye out as you progress and youre looking for  liam anyone who looks like theyre not a servant who looks like theyre maybe getting by well  marisha yeah kind of the same thing  matt okay continuing farther into the city this whole city has this vibrant life to it from the  way it reflects light from the everchanging flickering skylight from the sun to the flames  that adorn every single conjunction of roads that make their way through the city to occasionally  you 
none	 will see cracks in the ground where a flame will flare out then retract within go ahead and  make a perception check  laura can we also keep an eye out for anything flying i want to see if anythings flying around  the city at all  matt okay  liam 22  matt 22 no more than maybe five minutes into your walk into the city you do notice two efreeti  have begun to follow you from about 20 feet behind theyre both walking and talking to  themselves keeping an eye on you guys well 
town	 theyre about 25 30 feet behind as you continue  walking forward you do bring your attention ahead and at the next street junction which is more  like two alleys that collide you do see two individuals that walk out one of them is a  similar humanoid as to the strangelooking ones you saw go walking by there they have a thin  figure sallow elongated features their hair is wild and red and stringy and upward behind them  their eyes tend to have a nonhuman appearance to them the iris a lightorangish color they have  
none	 long white and gold robes and are walking alongside a tiefling of similar red skin to the  color of the efreeti here with deep gray long hair that goes behind a ridge of horns that curl  into almost like ram horns in the front and the long gray hair extends to the midback they both  walk along side by side their arms within their robes both are wearing matching white and gold  robes and they each step out from the alley and begin to walk ahead of you guys about 60 70 feet  liam so 
town	 its these two strange beings with strange eyes and a tiefling  matt theres one entity thats the strange being and the other is a tiefling  liam oh okay so one is one and ones another thank you im going to walk up to the tiefling  like ten feet away excuse me sorry can i trouble you for a minute ive just come to town  i know that sounds ridiculous it is im a stranger in a strange land could i borrow you  just for a minute  matt make a persuasion check  sam i 
none	 just got to hell havent even unpacked my bags  laura no warning huh  liam thats a 20  matt 20 they both turn and look towards you with a curious glance the strange alienlooking one  gives a halfcocked grin and shakes his head the tiefling looks you over for a second stranger i  mean you no offense but and as he looks past you at the rest of the group walking behind you  you know what follow me  marisha oh shit  taliesin well here we go  matt they both continue to walk 
none	 in the direction theyre walking  liam theyre together right  matt theyre together but they face away from you hes just follow me and they both  continue walking ahead of you guys  liam all right so i trip along behind them and then i turn around and to the group i go  taliesin im all right with this this is a great way to die  sam were following along behind them  laura ashley travis and marisha yes  marisha can i do like an insight check like size up this tiefling from a distance 
none	 and see what they  might be about get any idea about what they might do or be  matt go ahead and make an insight check from what very little bit of body language you can see its  going to be very hard to read anything  marisha thats really bad thats the gil dice 15  matt 15 unfortunately at the distance that he was from you about 60 feet or so and what  little bit time he was faced away his interaction with vax was so short its a blank slate nothing  you can 
none	 read off of him  laura are they looking and talking to each other at all  matt theyre not talking to each other theyre looking facing away from you and walking the  same pace they were however vex since you were looking up in the sky you do see for a brief  instant a large avianlike entity  laura what does avian mean  matt birdlike  laura oh got it  matt but massive and it looks to leave some sort of flamelike trail behind it as it fiery whooshing  liam laura and marisha whispering 
none	 a phoenix  ashley what  laura harry potter  travis fawkes  matt make an intelligence check  laura okay oh intelligence  matt yes  laura ew eight  matt eight yeah its a flaming bird  laura thats a fucking bird yall  marisha so they have birdies  sam so is it one of those what were they called ashley  laura ah natural 20 on the  ashley always  matt just dont do that because it doesnt matter all youre doing is killing yourself  laura  laura every time  matt all right 
none	 as you guys continue to follow these two  liam yeah where are they leading me  matt do you guys keep the same distance do you catch up with them do you stay behind what are  you doing  sam how far back are we  matt youre about 60 feet behind them  sam someone should  laura get a little closer  liam im going to wave them away a little bit  travis i think were cattle im going to lag im going to drop another 20 feet back from the group  matt okay 
none	 as you drop back from them you come pretty close to the two efreeti that are following  you from behind and one of them puts his hand out and grabs you by the shoulder and pats you and  goes so friend you are you are  travis what  matt who are you  travis i cant hear you  sam oh no  taliesin and marisha no  matt make a deception check  travis 17  matt heh i like this one well keep him and he pats you on the shoulder and they both walk 
none	  travis hey and i smash the titanstone knuckles together and i cast enlarge  matt okay you guys hear what sounds like a small crack of thunder behind you thunder crack sound  as you glance over you can see grog has swollen to his enlarged size and is now walking shoulder to  shoulder with the two efreeti that began to flank from behind they both take a step back i double  down on my statement we keep him and they keep walking shoulder to shoulder to you theyre not  doing anything theyre walking shoulder to 
none	 shoulder  marisha i stop and turn around and wait for them to catch up  ashley yeah  sam oh god i hang back as well  matt all right so you guys hanging back  laura im going to try to keep a little closer to the two in the front and try to see if i can  overhear their conversation at all if they talk  ashley im going to hang back until they come up  taliesin i am not hanging back i am right in the middle im trying to like be that middle 
none	 point  that keeps everything connected  laura this is like when your friends start to drink at the ren faire and youre like should we  keep going forward or what do we do do we wait  marisha well meet you at the axethrowing just go ahead  liam taliesin and marisha to the oubliette  liam just put it all out on the table  travis so are they keeping pace with me or are they standing next to me  matt theyre keeping pace with you as youre walking youre walking shoulder to shoulder as  
none	 the rest of you begin to slow down and catch up except for vex vax and percy who continue  forward we have pike keyleth and scanlan beginning to catch up with grog and as you guys  eventually get to the point where youre walking slow enough that the two efreeti catch up behind  you they keep walking with you  marisha i light up my flame hand and i turn to one of the efreeti and i go fist bump  laura oh no  marisha pound it man pound it  matt make a persuasion check

dung	 liam im going to stealth  matt stealth by going into the alley  liam before going into the alley i mean i dont know how dark this is  matt what are you stealthing behind  liam are we in broad daylight  matt its a pretty heh im not going to say it but the sun is high in the sky  liam yeah okay  laughter  sam mccree voice its full sunlight  taliesin mccree voice its lunchtime  liam okay so no changing in lighting in the smaller alley  matt correct  sam mccree 
none	 voice its just turned to pm  laura the efreeti behind us are they paying attention to us or are they completely distracted  by all of the  matt its hard to tell they dont seem to be paying any mind and when the two figures darted  off in the alleyway there was no  laura anything  liam and how far away from the other group are we at this point  matt at this point youre about 80 feet in front of them  liam all right i stop her and stop at the corner and 
none	 look around do i even see them if i look  around the corner  matt the two figures that darted off  liam yeah  matt yeah theyre about 15 feet back and theyre both waiting  liam we saw them dart to the right i dont know whats in there i go running in with my eyes  closed thats how i do  matt okay percy do you follow suit  taliesin oh yeah i follow suit yeah im running in there  matt okay the three of you dart in you guys watch as the three 
none	 of them vanish into that alley  marisha do the efreeti react to them vanishing  matt no but thats about two intersections ahead the ones immediately before you the efreet  goes turn left to pelors temple  taliesin for gods sake you two tell them that you have to meet your owner  travis oh do it tell them that weve got to meet our owner  matt left to pelors temple small one as you guys are coming to the intersection  ashley im so sorry what did you say left at where  matt right here 
none	  ashley were supposed to meet out master at the temple of pelor so  matt then i am taking you take a left  ashley im going to cast a zone of truth and ask him some questions  matt well hold on a second  taliesin yeah  ashley is that a bad idea  taliesin there are no good ideas anymore  marisha its all bad ideas in dungeons  dragons its really true  liam well what i would have done was  marisha sometimes you get lucky with a bad idea  taliesin thats all 
none	 the game is is getting lucky with bad ideas  sam were cubs fans walking down cleveland boulevard  matt well as you begin casting your spell because casting a spell is a very physical thing  you begin to whisper your various divine incantations beneath your breath and your holy  symbol of sarenrae begins to glow though diminished this far from the prime material plane  still effective you get partway through your incantation before the two efreeti who are  flanking grab grog by the shoulders and forcefully push like a giant wedge trying to shove your 
town	  entire group to the left down the street you being at the immediate brunt of that basically  are getting shoved in the shoulder and off to the side i need you to make a constitution saving  throw to see if you maintain concentration on the spell  ashley okay okay okay  marisha you busting out the hand cone  sam im busting out the hand cone ready to go  ashley seven  matt okay yeah so as youre partway through the incantation before it gets completely scattered  halfway through and the spell is lost 
none	 you still used the spell slot though  ashley okay  matt but theyre now using grog as the base point and all three of them are pushing you all to the  left forcefully scanlan what are you doing  sam are these humanoids  matt nope  sam okay im going to start singing i pick one the stronger of the two and im going to sing at  him or her i dont even know  matt you turn around and sing in their face  sam yeah yep singing at them singing i make you want 
none	 to leave the one youre with start a new  relationship with me thats how its going to be make you go  travis usher usher from 1999  sam a little usher im going to cast dominate monster on it  matt oh shit okay  laura oh god do they know theyre being dominated  sam of course but hopefully itll give us a getaway  matt whats the dc on this  sam well its my spell right 21  matt jesus christ dude  taliesin thats the angriest thing ive ever heard  matt fucking scanlan 
none	 let this be a lesson to all dms out there be careful about creating magical  items that increase spell dc  so thats a wisdom saving throw  sam you can always break it or something  matt lets not break it but be careful be mindful all right so wisdom saving throw two  on that all righty the efreet that is on the left side the one that is directly behind you  the other one thats pushing pike off to the side is separate the one thats behind you as you  turn around and begin 
none	 singing up to it it stops in its tracks and nods its head to the beat as  youre singing and its eyes halfclose for a second and you get the assertion that the spell  has taken effect the other ally is still pushing grog and pike and basically scooping you guys into  this alleyway to the left  ashley can i cast hold person on that one i think i can do it on a humanoid  liam laura and travis but hes not a humanoid  ashley hes not humanoid never mind thats what you literally 
none	 were just talking about  sam can i command him  marisha all right am i standing by scanlan are they in front of us now  matt no theyre behind you basically you got like shoved off at the point scanlan turned  around and did that as pikes being shoved off to the side and grog theyre both shoulder to  shoulder shoving you in that direction so that was your action  sam i cant also command him to do anything  matt hmm  sam cant i command him to do something  matt you can 
none	 im getting to that point all of this is happening simultaneously as youre doing  that singing in the face of that efreet you just got knocked out of your spell so youre going to  have to take a moment to do that keyleth grog what are you doing  travis im going to trip and fall flat down onto the ground  matt okay so you grunting and intentionally fall prone on the ground all righty keyleth  what are you doing if anything  marisha oh i dont want to do something im really bad at which 
none	 is talking to people i have  ideas okay is this what i want to do im going to do alter self and im going to change myself  into a tiefling  matt okay  marisha and then i oh god this is really terrible oh my god i am really bad at  deception im going to turn around and say im sorry there seems to be a miscommunication these  are my slaves they are already owned and my property release them immediately  matt okay so as scanlans in the middle of singing a song and 
none	 the one efreet stops in their  tracks you turn around and your form shifts what do you want your tiefling to look like  marisha you know i dont have a lot to go off of except for zahra and that one that was in front of  us so im going to do zahra like a red you know a red with like devilly horns definitely  give it a tail i want to look intimidating i want to look like you wouldnt want to meet me in  a back alley but thats where we are  
none	 ashley a bad bitch  marisha a bad bitch  matt and marisha bad bitch tiefling  matt which is still like an eighth as intimidating as an efreet but you whip around and  you say this im going to have you go ahead and make a deception check  laura come on keyleth you got it  marisha its just a straight roll oh god oh jesus christ nine  matt okay as youre talking up to the one on the left as grog falls forward hes looking off down  and hes going to reach for him 
none	 as you shout in his face scoffs and palms you in the face with  his hand and i need you to make a strength saving throw  marisha a saving throw oh that was almost so good that was almost great 13  matt 13 basically his hand grabs you and like his fingers close around the back of your head  holding you like a ball and lifts you a little off the ground and throws you into the alley so  as keyleth gets chucked off to the side of the alley youre finishing getting pushed off 
none	  scanlan what are you doing with your command over the efreet  sam i say to him hey sweet baby look at me its all going to be okay if you yell at your  friend to let us go  matt the efreet that you control turns around and goes hey this is not our business we need to  let them go the other efreet goes what are you talking about theyre at our disposal he looks  back at the first one who goes it doesnt matter let them go now the other one looks  
none	 down at you and looks at the other one thats cocked and glances down at you scanlan and  goes what have you done to my friend  sam i say to him im just a mere slave and kill him kill him now kill him right now  laughter  laura and taliesin oh no  matt i need to make a actually for dominate  laura get up and run you guys you better fucking run away  travis is anyone else in this alley  matt right now from what you can see you cant see anything 
none	 youre on the ground prone right  now youre surrounded by everyone shouting at each other at this moment from what you can see  nobody else is in this alleyway at the moment  laura its crazy city people fight all the time  ashley theyre used to this this is everyday life  liam yeah there are fights on every corner  matt okay yeah so the efreet that you control whos still staring at the friend looks at you as  you shout this grins and grabs the other efreet by the throat and slams him into 
none	 the wall  marisha run  matt you just go running  laughter  matt down the alleyway  marisha i want to go catch up with them  matt so as its holding the other efreet against the wall his thumbs pushing into his throat like  choking its reaching up and grabbing the back of the hands its legs flailing as bits of smoke  and ash being cast off keyleth runs past this tiefling fucking running as fast as you can down  the alleyway what are you guys doing  travis can i pop up grab 
none	 pike and start running after keyleth  matt yeah so you grab her by the back of the armor and lift her up off the ground pike you  start running but all of a sudden your feet are off the ground youre running in the air as grog  is like bounding with you  travis and im hoping that as we get towards the door i can shrink back down to go through any  doorway that theyre headed towards  laura were heading towards an alleyway  matt theres an alleyway is what you can see that 
none	 keyleth darts off into  travis good deal  matt scanlan what are you doing  sam i am staying put until my friends are far away im watching them watching them back and forth  matt okay you watch as the one efreet holding his friend against the wall there is like  strained grunt the one thats being choked goes choking whats this he reaches down and  pulls a blade out of the side and begins jabbing it into the arm of the guy whos holding him  ashley and taliesin run run  matt which does 
dung	 six damage there and he gets to make a saving throw because he took damage so  hes like stabbing him in the arm repeatedly the other guys like grunting still pushing into  his throat and he takes him lifts him up and slams him into the other wall causing him to drop  the dagger in the other hand and begins to push him down towards the ground you can see his eyes  still intense but controlled by the spell as hes pushing the other efreet into the dark stonework  and you can see it cracking 
none	 and breaking against the force the other efreet now is being held  against their foreign language and begins chanting something beneath his breath  sam oh shit they do magic shit  taliesin yes they do  sam i thought they were just big and scary  taliesin no  matt so hes currently chanting under his breath and you watch as the words begin to emit his form  begins to shimmer and change  sam how far have my allies gotten  matt if youre glancing around the alleyway at this point in time full pace full 
none	 round you see  grog and pike have just now disappeared around the corner of that alleyway  sam and keyleth is gone  matt keyleth is gone she got there before they did actually you guys would have caught up  pretty fast because of grogs speed so keyleth would have gotten a head start and then grog  bypassed her so you just see keyleth disappear behind the corner of the alleyway  travis ill snag keyleth too ive got them both  sam all right so my work here is done so im going to tip my 
none	 beret good day to you both and  ill dimension door into the alley with them or wherever they went actually i dont know that  alley so im going to go in that direction the number of feet i think it is  matt okay so youll be appearing at the mouth of that alleyway and you can dart into it i would  say go ahead and make a stealth roll to see if the one who is currently casting even has a glance of  seeing you out of the corner of his eye  sam oh 
none	 wow thats the best roll ive ever done 21 stealth  matt okay at the moment as you disappear into the door you watch as the efreet thats being  choked his form turns into reddishwhite gas like a cloud of mist and escapes the grip of his  friend who then looks up and lets see here okay yeah hes going to go ahead and angrily  look up and his legs turn into that burst of flame and begin to rise up and he begins clawing at the  gaseous cloud as you disappear and vanish leaving them 
none	 both still fighting you pull into the  alleyway and you guys are all there for a moment you see the rest of them further down the alleyway  now you continue following them i imagine  sam yeah  laura do we need to hide  marisha yeah do these alleyways connect does it block around  matt the one that you were pushed into essentially as you were walking forward is to the  left you guys continued forward past two more alleyways and then went to the second one to the  right that way and so 
town	 this one continues down and seems to curve around after about 100 feet or so  through a series of buildings that are built right next to each other giving you one pathway that  curves out of sight  laura lets go as far away out of sight as we can  matt okay so you guys continue forward down that alley you hear in the distance the muffled sounds  of some sort of weird echoey scuffle and it seems to vanish into the rest of the atmospheric sound  of general wind being blown through tight passages 
none	 and the occasional flare of flame you all turn  the corner as it begins to curve and suddenly theres another splinter alleyway that descends  into stairs and you guys following the two humanoid individuals you originally followed  continue down that path and they lead you into a small enclosed room theres a door thats  partially ajar and theyve shoved their way into it and disappear inside do you follow  laura i think thats the option everybodys running for their lives right now  matt all right so you guys all dart into this same room 
none	 as you guys all charge into here  sam we all die  matt yeah its filled with spikes and fire as you go charging into this room immediately its  much smaller that i think you all anticipated and it would be vex and vax getting there first you  guys charge into the room and your darkvision helps you as you adjust to the change of light  just in time for you to run into the two individuals that had led you in there this is  some sort of a storage room filled with a series 
dung	 of metallic boxes and this room could comfortably  fit five people and as soon as you charge you ram into their shoulder and before you can turn  all of a sudden you watch as grog with two other people comes slamming in and youve all very  tightly squeezed into this dark space  laura sorry  ashley i climb and sit on top of grog  matt as scanlan comes around the corner  sam right in behind grogs butt just smooshed on up  matt and you do sweaty cheek reverse motorboat its a terrible thing 
dung	  liam is it tight enough that the two strangers are smooshed in as badly as we are  matt yeah theyre like strained okay please   marisha is this dark  matt its dark theres no light in here yeah  marisha i lift my hand and i light it up to give us a little bit of light  travis could we close the door  taliesin scanlan close the door  sam muffled why are we in here  travis are there any windows or anything  matt no theres just the door you guys entered 
none	 its a storage shed  liam this is a little more than i think i was asking for but what is there to see in the city  of brass  matt youre asking this right now he looks at you youre asking this right now  liam so were out of sorts were not from here obviously  laura hi  liam hi thats my sister you can tell because she looks just like me  marisha aw grog  travis it was pike  ashley thats not true  marisha its a very small room  liam you 
none	 dont look like many of the larger folk thank you dear that weve seen around  here either are you from here are you strangers here  laura how are you not slaves right now  liam that  matt let me change this to a bit of a calmer circumstance here the tiefling says shh  laura sorry  matt shh close the door and it is like  laura can i climb up on one of the boxes to give more foot room  matt as you all inhale the door finally closes vex climbs up a minute 
none	 of quiet passes  eventually as silence passes for a bit you hear a voice a very soft and gentle voice that you  havent heard yet break the darkness he goes i think its safe to speak now the lithelooking  individual you saw earlier with the wiry red hair and the somewhat reddishblack eyes says well  it was uncommon to see individuals wandering this city with a look of absolute victimization  sam muffled we dont look that bad do we  laura i pick up scanlan and put him up on a box  liam those 
none	 arent pillows  sam i dont think grog wears underpants  travis who does  matt im senokir this is uten my business partner we are jewelers here in the city of  brass and if im not mistaken you now owe us a favor  liam maybe we could do a bit of business percival you were looking for a jeweler right  taliesin well its a little far away at the moment but we could do a bit of business because  we have other business to attend to  marisha what caught your attention on us aside 
none	 from the utter look of patheticness  matt favors are more useful when youre not in chains  laura yes this is true  matt so let us wait here about ten 15 more moments let any immediate chance of you running  into those thugs pass well have a more private conversation at our place of business if you  dont mind  laura why do you wear those white robes do they signify anything  matt they signify our freedom  marisha were you once in chains  matt few that come here manage to escape that fate 
none	 immediately we found our way  marisha thats ominous can i do an insight check does that mean he murdered a lot of  fricking people  matt make an insight check  marisha lets go druid dice oh god ooh its an 18 what was it insight right 29  laura whoa youve got really high insight  taliesin she know shit  sam whispers loot crate everybody loot crate is a wonderful sponsor a fine handsome company  laura magic  sam their theme is magic youll get a box of magic shit  taliesin doctor strange is 
none	 part of this one  laura and i think magical beasts  sam these are movies that i will never see because i have children  taliesin in about 15 years were going to sit down and show you everything its going to be great  marisha which one was the tiefling and which one was him  matt the one thats been speaking to you is the other humanoid of strange racial origin  marisha senokir is the humanoid  matt yeah senokir is the humanoid  marisha who is somethings off about him  matt somethings different you 
none	 dont recognize his race or background  marisha uten how long have the two of you been in business together  matt shh let us wait we will continue this conversation at our establishment  laura is this your room  matt no  laura whose room is it  matt i have no idea which is why we shouldnt stay long  ashley do you know where those thugs were trying to take us or have an idea  matt i have no idea but i imagine they would have called in some friends to meet you and you 
none	  would have found yourselves in a very tough position  liam all right its really starting to smell like grog in here so why dont we go  matt a few more moments please  travis it was really hard not to fight man i do terrible when i dont fight  matt shh you wait in awkward silence for the next five minutes with any sort of sound  utterance or conversation being immediately shushed by senokir eventually  ashley fart sound  matt senokir perks up and the slightly pointed ears of his form seem to almost 
town	 twitch i think  passage is safe very well open the door follow us please as you guys filter out they  continue a quick pace and lead you through a series of winding side streets and momentary  pauses to pass as a number of other creatures and individuals walk by passing efreeti passing  occasionally some sort of giant winged red creature that stalks down the street dragging  behind it a large cart that has bars in it you can see a number of smaller almost i wouldnt  say feytype creatures but things that are definitely 
town	 not of this realm that are all bound  by neck irons you do also see a few small families wander through laughing that appear to  be humanoid but once again their physicality is very similar to the individual senokir  eventually you are led back to a simple exterior its a back entrance leading away from this main  street they both enter to this iron doorway senokir pulls something from a pocket and glances  at the rest of you he pricks his finger and places it to the edge of this object some sort of  
none	 a disk and it has a small point on one end that he uses to prick his finger once hes smeared his  blood on the disk he presses it against the door and the iron door opens up a little bit places it  in his pocket come inside so we may speak please  taliesin and liam all right  laura i want to look in his eyes as we are about to go through and see if how honest he looks  matt make an insight check  liam i mean everybody in this city wants us 
none	 as slaves so its not really any more dangerous in  there than it is  sam kind of flattering really  laura 21  sam its like one of those beefcake slave auctions for charity  matt glancing at him hes a very hard individual to read he has this awkward stilted  conversational cadence to his way of speaking and whenever he speaks to you hes not quite looking  at you  laura hey my eyes are down  matt he doesnt seem dishonest just hard to read  laura all right i like your hair and 
none	 i walk in  matt okay as you guys enter these wall sconces begin to come to life on their own across the  walls on the inside you can see this gorgeous workspace for all sorts of smalllevel metallurgy  and metalcraft percy you really appreciate this you see small furnaces and a number of metals laid  out in ingots some used in different volumes many substances and things that youve never seen  before a couple of small boxes to the side of rough uncut gems currently at this distance  taliesin my word  laura i 
none	 walk up and smack percy on the ass and say feel like making a home here and walk past him  taliesin im certainly thinking of some plans  matt as the door closes behind and the two individuals walk in they rummage around and begin  finding some small stools and arrange them so they can present to you more like treat you like a  guest he sets them down please sit and we shall speak  travis okay  laura how long does locate object take to cast  sam well thats not something you would ask 
none	 him i think hes just our host here  matt i have no idea these words you speak all right locate object locate object is one action  so it takes six seconds to cast  laura can i try to cast it as we sit down and see if its in our vicinity  sam you can cast that shit all the time  taliesin how often can you cast it  laura well its a 2ndlevel spell so i can do it a bit  matt so as everyones sitting on your stools and getting ready you close 
dung	 your eyes for a second  concentrate mutter beneath your breath you extend your understanding in this dark space  around you waiting for the warmth of any sort of call to the dawnmartyr plate eventually your  mental expansion reaches the limitations of the spell with nothing coming back  laura tight tight tight  matt as youve all sat down and assembled senokir sits as well hands crossed very  pleasantly in front of him very up straight strange head cocked a little to the side so  youve found yourselves here out of place and weve helped 
none	 you once we will discuss the terms  of our repayment for our aid but before then i must ask why you would come here so unprepared  marisha so unprepared does the name thordak ring a bell the cinder king its a pseudonym maybe  matt i have heard this name  sam alias  laura did he hang out around here  matt no he stayed mostly over the sea of fire  laura hmm anywho  sam what about that plate of no maybe i mean i dont know what are we here for  matt what 
none	 are you here for  marisha thordak has escaped into our realm  matt good keep him away from here  marisha all right thats what we want as well  liam you have a distaste for the wyrm  matt no i just dont trust dragons  taliesin hes currently still linked to this realm  matt hmm  taliesin we are trying to take care of as much of it as humanly possible  matt heh humanly  taliesin as much as humanly possible perhaps a little bit more we are here for the little bit  more 
none	 we seek powers to help us defeat the dragon  matt perhaps i can be of aid what powers do you seek  laura what powers can you do  matt i asked my question first  sam so creepy  taliesin perhaps it is time to lay it on the line time is of the essence  liam sure go for it  taliesin lets make a deal  liam if this goes south we can just wrap it up  taliesin we seek a set of plate armor  laura a trinket really nothing huge somebody won it 
none	 in a game of poker i believe cards  sam a card game of some sort  taliesin the plate of the dawnmartyr  marisha it used to belong to the suutan bloodline  matt suutan now that i am aware of  marisha yes  matt does it still belong in the possession of this suutan  laura i dont think so  sam our information says it does not  marisha it was won by a fire giant  matt a fire giant within this city  taliesin that is our belief  sam are there any fire 
none	 giants in this city  matt that narrows it down there are only three that live here  sam oh well thats great  matt not under subjugation  sam happen to have their names  laura do people under subjugation own a lot  matt generally no those that own them own what they own so maybe its one of them we can  go ask  sam are they close  matt relatively depending on which one you ask first  sam you could just give us their addresses or something and we could go check it out 
none	 if you had a  thomas guide  laura wheres uten whats uten doing  matt uten is sitting back arms crossed  laura he seems totally chill this is the way this dude talks all the fucking time  laughing  matt completely unfazed  taliesin depending on how things go we may even speak of perhaps commissioning some pieces your  work is astounding  matt he suddenly leans forward steps up from the stool and walks over to you and begins to look  very closely over your clothing can you afford what i make  taliesin 
none	 possibly i would like to think so depending on how the next few weeks go there will  be much to celebrate and your work is celebratory  laura do you require monetary compensation or is it something more  matt depends i have plenty of money but you owe me and if i help you find this giant and this  armor youre seeking you will owe me even more so to keep this interesting how about we go find  this armor  liam you dont even want to hint at what youre looking for  matt wheres 
none	 the fun in that  liam you cheeky bastard matthew mercer  matt so to the giant  laura should we make ourselves not look like us should we maybe look like something different  travis yeah how will you keep us from being harassed in the streets  matt well i mean no disrespect but he lifts his hand and snaps the fingers you watch as uten  goes oh right sorry i got you he goes rummaging through a case and you hear what sounds  like the dragging and clanging of many pieces of small metal procures 
none	 a series of chains and neck  irons senokir looks up theres not much else i have to offer but for the most part you wont be  bothered  ashley oh you love it  taliesin let me put forward a theory for you  travis you son of a bitch  taliesin i hate those eyes i cant look at them i hate you whatever deal we make with you here  for the record none of us will be staying we may be coming back to fulfill some service we may be  coming back to fulfill 
none	 some favor and we will if that is the deal we make  matt if that is the deal we make  taliesin but the deal we make will not include any of us is that understood is that agreeable  sam unless its for a onetime sexual favor of some sort  taliesin only with him  laura in which case take your pick  sam im up for that  travis im up too  taliesin oh my god you people  matt i think you will find our arrangements agreeable  taliesin and i may have some 
none	 things to excite you with as well stop it i know youve been doing  it all game  ashley that was me  marisha he said in accent  matt it seems weve found some semblance of an accord for the time come place these gently upon  yourselves and well be on our way  laura dont you have any white robes you can give us instead  matt im sorry no those come with station and station requires recognition none will recognize  you here youll be found out immediately  sam should we chain ourselves to 
none	 each other or to you how does this work  laura check out those chains and see if theyre magic  marisha a few of us could look like you to keep all of us out of chains maybe a few exceptions  laura you can get big and then look like an efreeti  marisha i can look like one of them very simply i think wed all feel a little bit comfortable if  some of us were free  matt sure if you are confident  marisha i study him and i change to like a  
none	 laura maybe somebody that is better at talking  marisha i dont have to talk i just have to look like someone else thats not that hard  taliesin oh for gods sakes  sam im going to go look at the chains and arcana check them  matt go for it  marisha i change myself to look like one of him im like eh eh passable  sam oh 22 no just 20  matt just 20 the chains appear to be mundane they are heavy they are thick they are  definitely functional but they are not

none	 the chains attack to the neck  iron about there so you dont have a whole lot of arm movement and then the neck iron has a chain  from the back that is held and actually uten begins to gather all the chains at the very back  and runs them to a singular ring which is held by him  ashley can i put on if i put on my glove of storing does that mean i have to take off one of  the gauntlets  matt glove of storing yeah you wouldnt be able to have
