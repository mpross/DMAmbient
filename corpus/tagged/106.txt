/none/ dramatic music  travis right listen up if you have ale then you have a friend in grog strongjaw a goliath of  towering height and size this barbarian has an appetite for the two great loves in his life  combat women and ale chuckle  record scratch wait  easily the brains of the group grog is often consulted for his vast knowledge of shapes  colors and chuckle shiny things  also ale  in his early years armed with his twohanded great axe grog often enjoyed proving his might  amongst the ranks of his familys /none/ wandering herd but after coming upon an unsuspecting elderly  gnome in the woods he objected to the killing of such an innocent life a creature of impulse grog  felt only pity for this well this terrified little thing and his disobedience  cost him dearly  beaten bloody and banished by the herd leader his uncle kevdak grog was abandoned and left to die  exiled from his herd it was then that the relative of the very gnome he fought to save  saved him it was the kindness of a gnome cleric named pike that healed /none/ grog bringing him back  from deaths edge and they have remained close friends ever since  most nights grog can be found challenging entire taverns to wrestling matches ha or accompanying  scanlan to the nearest house where you pay for lady favors  also ale  marisha a first impression of keyleth would leave you with little information on the halfelven  druid you might even think that her social awkwardness due to her sheltered upbringing is  kind of sweet chuckle  of course it would be unwise to underestimate her based on first impressions thunder under /none/ that  unintimidating petite frame is a vicious beast waiting to be unleashed whose natural powers have  made even the fiercest of champions pee their pants literally soft chuckle  born to the air tribe of the ashari people keyleth was raised with a deep love of nature and  the elemental magics it is her peoples inherent duty to protect the delicate areas in taldorei  where the four elemental planes begin to bleed with this realm  since she was a little girl she had quite a knack for air manipulation and beast shaping abilities  well /none/ if you consider kittens and flying squirrels to be little beasts which i do clears throat  anyways it wasnt long before the headmaster of the tribe her father korren realized her true  prodigious abilities and she was inveterated to succeed him as the next headmaster  just like that her jovial childhood was stripped and replaced with endless spell memorization  teachings from ancient traditions and exceedingly high expectations every druid leader to be must  embark on a journey to seek out the sister tribes in order to introduce and establish respect amongst  the fellow headmasters /none/ they call this the aramente or noble odyssey when her father felt  she was ready he set her on the path to truly discovering herself not knowing when or if she  will ever return  as she hiked down the mountain towards stillben she meditated on the task ahead part of the  aramente is proving yourself a strong warrior a valiant protector and a wise and compassionate  leader with this knowledge one thought plays on repeat in her mind is she even worthy  taliesin percy was the third of seven children born to a noble /dung/ family who lived far to the north  in the ancient castle of whitestone with so many siblings to share the burdens of lordship percy  turned his attentions to the sciences engineering and naturalism  one day a mysterious couple named lord and lady briarwood came to court during a feast held in  their honor the briarwoods violently took control of the castle killing or imprisoning everyone who  would stand in their way  percy awoke chained in the dungeon only to be freed by his younger sister together they fled  chased by the briarwoods men /none/ as they ran percys sister took several arrows to the chest  and fell percy kept running eventually jumping into a freezing river and floating unconscious to  freedom he did not remember waking up on a fishing boat he barely remembered the next two  years as he slowly made his way as far south as possible  then one night percy had a dream a roaring cloud of smoke offered him vengeance against those who  destroyed his family when he awoke percy began to design his first gun gunshot  ashley pike grew up on the outskirts /town/ of town near the bramblewood  her ancestors were a family of deep gnomes with quite an unfavorable reputation  thievery destruction and trickery left them with the curse of the last name trickfoot  sarenrae the goddess of healing and redemption had other plans for pikes greatgreat grandfather  wilhand who left his family at a young age after a dream a dream that changed the course of the  trickfoot family wilhand devoted his life to  sarenrae and pledged from then on that him  and his family would live a life of service and devotion  /none/ as a child pike seemed to have an affinity to heal  whether it was animals people or even flowers  she felt she had a purpose in making things whole that had once been broken  she studied and learned the ways to heal through divine magic  she lived a peaceful life quiet and simple until one day wilhand was captured and almost killed  by a group of goliath barbarians one of the  goliaths took a stand against the  murder of the innocent gnome and he himself was beaten bloodied and left for dead  /none/ abandoned by his herd wilhand went to pike for help she prayed and healed this barbarian  as best she could bringing him back to life when he awoke she discovered his name  was grog strongjaw after that they were the best of friends a rather unlikely pair  little did she know that in a few years time grog would soon return the favor and  bring her back from the clutches of death roar crunch  after being killed in battle pike felt angry she wanted to be stronger so that it would never  happen again /none/ she spent four months at sea  training with the men and women aboard a ship  called the broken howl gripping her holy symbol in one hand and her morningstar in the other  this time pike is ready  sam oh you havent heard of scanlan shorthalt well gird your loins ladies because he has his  eye on you  a talented musician master of disguise and dashingly handsome in his own mind scanlan sings  songs almost as much as he sings his own praises  born a poor gnome scanlan used his endless charm and /town/ soaring tenor voice to croon for coin and  support his single mother one day he was discovered by a halforc promoter and joined dr  dranzels spectacular traveling troupe where he learned the ways of the world and honed his  skills as a bard extraordinaire  a loner much of his life scanlan has never quite come to terms with the violent death of his mother  at the hands of a goblin invasion while his years on the road provided many shall we say  educational experiences with the opposite sex deep down scanlan yearns for the /town/ one thing hes  never known the true love of a fellow gnome  still scanlan considers himself a lover first performer second and fighter distant third on  the battlefield hell support his allies but rarely draws blood unless its to protect fellow  gnome pike  count on scanlan for a hearty laugh a rollicking song and a twinkle in his eye that melts hearts  and makes the females swoon  orion greetings and salutations i am tiberius stormwind i hail from a town called tyrex  located in the heart of draconia  from a politically /none/ respected family at the age of 15 i succeeded in passing the sorcerers rite  showing prodigylike control of my magic the judges and the draconian high council were amazed  at how powerful my spells were for how long i had been training at 20 years old i was the youngest  appointed member of the magic guild in draconian history for the next few years i almost went mad  from the malaise of being a guild member as its rather boring  however one day i happened upon a chamber unused for quite some time in the /none/ room were stacks of  books and maps of the surrounding cities and areas around the known world for months i would  frequent the chamber and learned of artifacts from legend  after a long period of research i made a list of artifacts that caught my eye i brought these  findings to the high council and was told that all of the information in the chamber i had stumbled  upon was either believed to be fiction or unsolvable mysteries and hence were lost forever  i found those answers to be unacceptable  a year later /town/ i devised a ruse and managed to convince the city council to lend support in me  leaving draconia on a mission of peace and diplomacy for the surrounding kingdoms going from  town to town and making friends and allies in and for the name of draconia being a red dragonborn  i had quite the task on my hands in that respect but it was exactly what i needed so i could  explore the world and find these artifacts as i felt the truth was out there  some may describe me as buffoonish but i say /none/ poppycock to all that i am much sharper than most  give me credit for i just dont pay attention to things sometimes ive also been known to be  rather cunning loyal happygolucky and well dangerous i cant help but show my true scales  every now and then but overall i think im quite friendly for a dragonborn  liam never entirely welcome in the company of elves or men vaxildan learned at a young age to  skip past formality preferring instead to invite himself in your door  along with twin sister vexahlia vax was born /town/ by a chance encounter between elven royalty and human  peasantry raised by their mother in their early years the twins were eventually sent off to their  father in the elven capital of syngorn but their cool reception among the elves there never warmed  and their time in the capital didnt last the siblings stole away one autumn night and set out  on the open road  after a few years of wandering they eventually decided to return to their mother and journeyed  back to the lands of their youth but instead of finding their childhood /none/ home they returned to a  pile of rubble their mother was gone their home burned to ash pressing the townspeople for  answers they learned of the day the dragon came roar with their ties all severed vaxildan and  his sister set out to find their fortune together in taldorei  an outsider since birth vax quickly learned to solve lifes challenges in his own particular way  often by sidestepping them entirely and when his knack for circumventing adversity isnt enough  knife scraping the way of blades the elves schooled him in more than  makes /none/ up the difference  laura like so many halfelves vexahlia has spent most of her life suffering the cool  reception of a people who dont fully accept her born of a human mother and an elven father who  only later in life took an interest in their existence vexahlia and her twin brother  vaxildan quickly realized the only people they could truly rely on in this world  were each other  matt hello everyone sorry for the delay we had a few folks that were in transit but were all  good were all here now /none/ and welcome to a very special episode of critical role we have a number  of members of our party that are on vacation this week so as opposed to continuing a climactic  endpoint of a long 1112 week story arc were going to hold off a week and have them return next  week to pick up where we left off just after the battle with the big bad beholder kvarn the mad  however this week what were going to be doing is essentially a little workshop a class if you  will on dungeons  dragons /dung/ and roleplaying games in general for those of you out there that have  never played before for those of you who have played and want to pick up some new skills or  ideas and for many who are out there who have either had a hard time dungeon mastering or have  been too scared to try being a dungeon master or game master depending on your roleplaying game of  choice were going to try to dispel some of that and give some tips and tricks along the way  so first and foremost lets go around /none/ the table and say hello to everyone who is here we have  marisha ray who plays keyleth in our usual campaign  marisha

was asking for it joke but i feel like  matt yeah no  zac maybe yknow maybe just i mean you kinda did  laughter  dan just took the long way around  marisha took the long way around  matt it is also the birthday of our fantastic halfelven ranger laura bailey who plays vex in  the show the reason that their characters are twins is because they actually share a /none/ birthday  and they created it that way so that was kind of a cool little point there but shes off with her  husband in greece having great vacation times or whatever pfft  liam boring  orion wait oh they went to the country greece  taliesin i thought they went to the show  liam they are seeing greece yeah yeah yeah north hollywood  marisha no i dont think anyone does that anymore like goes yknow  orion well i dont know they might have interests im not aware of just saying  matt thats very /none/ openminded of you orion well done all right cool so lets get this started  zac lets learn  matt so were gonna start here with a little overview of character creation so for most rpgs  especially those in the fantasy realm this will be a very familiar aspect where there are many  different game types that run different things but usually the point goes you choose a race and  you choose a class the race defines your physical background your family bloodline and what  attributes that adds to you a class is essentially the job /none/ or the way youve lived your  life going forward and what skills youve acquired because of it so throughout the players  handbook you can go ahead and turn through the first few pages first couple sections youll see  there are certain races like the dwarf whom i love dwarves are awesome underrepresented  marisha if everyone can turn to page 62 in the players handbook  matt exactly its in the players handbook my good man  zac technically page 18 page 18  matt dwarves are cool theyre sturdy theyre strong theyre a little brash theyre /none/ yknow  if thats something you guys are thinking about as youre coming up with your character ideas  dwarves are fun for that reason im gonna breeze through these cause we dont want you to spend 30  minutes on races we have elves elves you know elves lord of the rings elves are cool they  have high elves which are a little more haughty and welllearned we have the forest elves or  whatever it is theyre called or are they just the basic all right we have wood elf there we  go which are more /dung/ of the legolasstyle you know in the woods hunting being stealthy and then  you have the dark elves which are the drow that are from actually the underdark where you guys  have been fighting through though you have not encountered any drow in the underdark  marisha we havent  taliesin we had half a drow  matt stitch monster was elven not drow  taliesin oh i thought it was a drow  liam theyre mostly bad most are bad  matt yeah so there are also halflings which you could say hobbit but i think the /none/ dungeons   dragons version of halflings are a little more awesome buttkicking a little less i just want  to stay home and make little farm animals  zac we found what lucas is short  marisha short  matt we got humans which are cool and wellrounded all across the board you got  dragonborn which have dragon bloodlines like tiberius over here get like a breath weapon get  really strong charismatic you have gnomes which we have two gnomes in our campaign theyre the  smallest of all the races theyre also probably the most nimble /none/ and the most naturally resistant  against magic types so they can  liam are they the shortest  matt they are the shortest yes shorter than dwarves and halflings you also have halfelves  which we have quite a few in our campaign  marisha represent  matt happened through some drunken evening between a human and an elf  dan sick  matt get a little bit of both sides then you have the halforc which is halfhuman halforc  generally a much larger stronger quicker to anger ready for battle type and then you have  the /none/ tieflings who are humanoid but have somewhere in their previous bloodline some contact with  demonic forces that left them with some essence of the hells in their bloodlines like horns tails  yellow eyes think nightcrawler from xmen thats kind of what a tiefling would look like  possibly with horns so those are the races so if you have some ideas keep that in the back of your  mind and write down on your sheet what you think would be a cool race  orion i think a new one is the djinn like theres like a /none/ djinn race like theres an air a  water and a fire and earth elemental like a half human and yeah  dan whoa like an evil genie  matt thats cool  orion i think the new expansion like djinns however you say it  matt and of course we also have the goliaths which are halfgiants were not going to be  working with that tonight cause those were in the new elemental evil edition thats what grog  is theyre big strong guys so keep in mind the race you want to play which is cool classes /none/ we  got so we got barbarian grog is a great example of a barbarian big hearty warrior types that  shun armor for just pure aggression and anger they use rage as a means of destroying their foes  upping their abilities in combat and preventing mental effects magically affecting them we have  bards bards are vastly skilled across the board they have skills of all types even things they  dont know very well they know a little bit of everything kind of a jack of all trades they  have some minor spellcasting they also can /none/ inspire other people with songs speech and help  them out with certain skill checks bards are pretty cool we got clerics your healers but you  say healer youre like i dont want to be a healer clerics also have access to really  powerful divine magic so while people may be oh clerics are dumb you heal the party they  can also call down divine judgment which is great  marisha also having a healer is really nice yeah nice being able to have a healer  taliesin the hell dude yeah we shouldve just worn the /none/ same shirt  matt but dont feel like you have to this is a oneshot you guys can pick whatever you want we  got druids which do  dan laughs yeah total party wipe  matt exact oh it could happen i wont feel guilty about this one  laughter  zac thanks man cmon  matt hey first time in the game done  dan i take the physical challenge  laughter  matt physical challenge physical challenge druids also have some healing capabilities they  also have more naturebased magics theyre cool and they control nature and /none/ can turn into beasts  and creatures like that keyleth is a druid  taliesin giant scorpions  matt indeed we have fighters fighters are just straightup fighters imagine what a fighter is  thats a fighter they can use all armor and all weapons they can generally get more attacks than  other classes theyre generally like the marshal the generals the warriors the pit fighters  theyre just more rough and tumble lets just damage each other weve got monks monks crazy  fast punch and do awesome damage with their bare fists they can avoid things they /none/ can do multiple  hits per round they can use ki points to inflict different types of attacks monks are basically  if you wanna be ip man in the middle of a dd campaign pick a monk  orion and i believe like the monk and sorcerer are the only ones that have  like the point system  matt yeah we have paladins bastion of good and right in the world paladins stand for law and  wonder and if anyone proves themselves evil they will be destroyed and smited by the divine  energies of their god /none/ so theyre generally pretty pious they fight for good they fight for  the underdog they can like a fight  marisha just saw zac perk up there  zac yeah  matt they have good fighting abilities they can wear and use most armor and weapons but they also  get a little bit of divine clericbased magic and they can heal with a touch  liam total boy scouts  matt yeah  marisha total boy scouts  matt we got rangers which is what lauras character vexahlia is they have good either  twoweapon or ranged combat /none/ they can pick a companion animal if they want to thats how  trinket came about yknow definitely the legolas of lord of the rings type arrow arrow arrow  everythings getting arrows arrowd and they got rogues which is what liam plays in our game  rogues are all about stealth stabbing in the back finding weak points of their enemies and  doing serious damage with precision strikes by distracting their enemies and finding where their  weak points are they generally dont have a lot of hit points or defenses but if they can get in  /none/ there sneakily theyll do some serious damage then we got sorcerer which tiberius is which is  a magical caster arcanebased whereas a wizard is more of like the classic wizard you see with  giant spell books learning and yknow harry potterstyle classes and that kind of learned  magical ability sorcerers have it innately in their blood from their bloodlines somehow and  their casting ability is kind of like an improvised thing they just learned and are good  at so imagine more of a lesslearned lesscontrolled wizard that mostly understands  some magic naturally whereas the /dung/ wizard is the yknow the welllearned spell book type more  studious have a larger breadth of spells to pick from but the sorcerers a little more improvised  and can use points to instill power with it last but not least we got a warlock warlocks are  magical practitioners who draw their magic from making a pact with some otherworldly entity it  can be like demons or the nine hells and they draw more hellfire and infernaltype magics they can  make a pact with dark fey which are basically like creepy oberonstyle yknow fairy elf people /none/  from a midsummer nights dream or the great old ones like cthulhu hi cthulhu give me magic  what could possibly go wrong those are warlocks so those are primarily your classes you get to  pick you choose a race and you choose a class you guys have some ideas yet of what you might  want to play tonight  zac oh most definitely yeah  ify oh yeah  dan oh a hundred percent  matt well what do you want to play lets start with dan dan what do you want to play  dan /none/ im going to be a dwarven rogue yeah rogue tumbler not the block  matt all right fantastic how about you zac  zac i am the snugglelord i am a warlock tiefling and i derive my powers from all holy  overlord of geek and sundry the evil overlord  matt okay that would fall under infernal okay  marisha this is feeling really meta  zac no  matt yeah im gonna say that that most definitively falls under the fiend pact yup so  youre in a fiend pact and then what do you got ify  /tavern/ ify ha imma be ulfgar fireforge fighter dwarf twohanded swordsman cut your face off  take your money  laughter  ify aka true neutral  matt all right  laughter  marisha true neutral do it  matt this is gonna be a very fun short game  laughter  zac we got this what are you talking about  dan never made it out of that first tavern  laughter  matt aw man you guys  zac i set the place on fire  laughter  matt wait were not there yet were not there yet hold /none/ it hold it back hold it back cool  so for each of you guys lets go ahead and roll up some stats for you so what you do to decide  what your attributes are for your characters that basically says how strong they are how hearty  their physicality is how fast they are and you have strength dexterity constitution  intelligence wisdom and charisma those are the six stats so for you guys if you want to go  ahead and take there are different ways of rolling stats some people do a pointbuy system  where /none/ you start with a certain base stat and you can buy based on points for this were gonna use  my favorite system to do which is you roll 4d6  ify oh my favorite too  matt drop the lowest arrange as desired so i guess for those of you who havent seen how the  dice work there are different dice values in the game you have a d4 which is a foursider dice  so its the little caltrop painful to step on you got a d6 your typical sixsided dice d8  which is a little /none/ more pointy thats an eightsider you got a tensider which comes in  two varieties regular or additional numbers this is if youre doing percentage rolls you know  what the percentile dice numbers are pardon me a d12 which is only really used if youre a  barbarian apparently its the saddest and the redheaded stepchild of dd  taliesin i use a d12  matt oh yeah thats right you use it too its great im happy it needs more love it needs  more love d12 needs more love and the d20 which is the mostused dice /none/ in the game most all  decisions are based on a 20sided dice well get into that in a little bit so for the statistics  i need you guys to go ahead and take 4d6 so four sixsided dice well start whoever wants to  start go ahead and you  marisha i have the four those four right up front  zac right up front  marisha there you are  matt you roll them drop the lowest number  dan yahtzee  matt starting with a seven awesome  dan yeah big sev  marisha woo  /none/ matt so you can decide where you want to put your seven in any of those stats  marisha if your stats are super crappy well roll again  matt no we wont  marisha no we wont not tonight never mind but normally if your stats are super crappy  dan its not that kind of campaign no play it where it lies  matt you can put it wherever you want to ten is an average score an average person has a ten  dan so c  marisha what we generally do is roll all six and /none/ then write them down and then decide where you  want them okay  matt what you got over there  zac i have 15 on my first one  ify eight  matt ooh nice 15 and eight what you got dan  ify oh sorry that counts as a six  dan oh there we go big 13 big 13 in the house  ify so that was im sorry correction 14 was that  matt all righty  ify apparently this was from a wild western and they have a bulls head as a six instead of /none/ a  matt there you go all righty and well say for the purposes of this well give you guys each if  you want to roll five times not six  zac five times okay  dan laughing all right 12  matt okay so roll five times and then everyone for the purposes of this game  dan oh finally 17  matt there you go  zac all right and then we choose where they go  matt so you rolled five times you have five numbers then take a 16  dan ooh  matt you /none/ can put it anywhere you want  zac why thank you good sir  matt i figure for this that way if anyone just rolls crappy then theyre not doing too bad  dan get that seven for a bit of character  matt dude lower stats are some of my favorites like honestly having something lower than ten  at least one is great thats how grog got his intelligence to six tiberiuss wisdom of four  like those are great defining characteristics of a character so  marisha yeah i generally have a charisma of eight but i /none/ have that circlet  which is boosting me  matt boosts you to average from below laughs  marisha which just makes me average right  liam everyones gonna play this game the way they want to but i think if youre playing it for like  the numbers and maxing out your numbers and the like how can i deal the most damage when  youre picking your skills its less fun like choose the things that draw you to it as a  character or personality or be really weak with powerful magic or be totally musclebound like /none/ grog  with a and be a yknow an idiot  orion thats why tiberius is so bumbly sometimes and really doesnt know shit its his first time  out in the world  dan unless youre super into math which im not  matt but go math  dan yeah if thats your bag do it  matt cool so once you have your stats arranged from that point  you can start going to your characters and were gonna go ahead and just make level two characters  relatively simple for this first game if you look to /none/ where your classes are itll have a hit  point value as well and were gonna roll how many hit points you have everyone starts with at  level one max hit point value and i think lets see for the rogue we have a d8 so you start at  eight hit points  dan oh boy im gonna roll again  matt and you roll 1d8 to add to that for level two  dan two  matt two all right  dan a hot ten double digits dont like to brag  laughter  matt now whats /dung/ your constitution  dan oh that will i havent assigned them yet  matt okay  dan but cause i wanted to i know as a dwarf i get 2 to my constitution correct  matt true exactly yup  dan okay  marisha yeah you get certain racial stat bonuses depending on what race you choose  matt yeah yeah what well do is well do a couple of choosing things and then ill have you  guys go over and help them with actually building the minutia of the characters while i go over the  dungeon master /none/ section of this  marisha okay  liam you had to bring race into it  matt i do i know cool so to just get the hit point roll out of the way too for you zac  zac cool so its a d8  matt as a warlock you are sings you are rolling a d8 as well so you start with eight  and then add this to it  zac eight  matt cool 16  ify nice good roll  matt and you got a d10  ify ten ten and then imma add five /none/  matt 15 on you the warlock has the most hit points  laughter  matt well see where everyones constitution lies in a bit so stats ten is average and then  every two above a ten creates a modifier so like a 12 that stat it has a 1 modifier at 14 its  a 2 at 16 its a 3 18 a 4 and so on and what that modifier is is its the bonus you get  to any ability or attempt you make towards something that falls under that stats category  like if youre /none/ trying to break through a door youd roll a d20 and add your strength yknow or  if youre trying to like a lot of the the reflex saving or the dexterity saving throws  its based off your dexterity youd roll a d20 and then add what your modifier would be for your  dexterity so those modifiers based on your stat are what affect your d20 rolls for most everything  you do in the game lets see so those are the stats well get to skills here in a moment well  you guys will go over /none/ the specifics of that with them but everyone should be at a proficiency  bonus of 2 you should see at the top left of your sheet it says proficiency bonus above your  stats put a 2 in there now under each class in your section itll have a section for skills  itll say which skills youre proficient in under proficiencies and itll have you choose a few  what you do is in the character sheet you have these nice little bubbles here that you get to  fill in next to those skills those mark which /none/ ones youre proficient in so you can go ahead and  choose those and fill em in lets see i think for now if you guys want to go over and help them  get their classes a little underway of getting the minutia of that building process im gonna jump  into the next section of this  taliesin oh yeah oh yeah lets do this  matt all right so you guys feel free to go over there and help them  liam okay youre gonna chat while we  matt yup  liam great  matt keep /dung/ it a little quiet were gonna turn those mics down over there were gonna keep on  mine and im gonna go ahead and go over more of the actual dungeon mastering  marisha who wants to pick who for their coach  zac i need all the help in the world  marisha do we have like individual coaches  zac who wants to be really disappointed at the end of the night  liam me me me  zac okay help me  orion which one of you is a caster what are you ify  ify im /dung/ a fighter so  matt all righty so lets move on to the next section here welcome to the role of a dungeon  master or game master of this so there are a number of things that youre required to be when  it comes to dungeon mastering largely your goal is to be a fair judge you take all the actions  and the activities and the intent and the phrases that the players do and you judge whether or not  it was a good attempt or a bad attempt and modify a difficulty based on it /dung/ basically for most  things that are actively a challenge in the game you as the dungeon master decide how difficult it  is given the circumstance if its a really really weak door someones trying to kick through  like the doors been dilapidated and rotting you might say its pretty easy so you give it like a  score of seven to ten as the difficulty and then whoevers trying to break it has to roll equal to  or higher than that number if its an ironreinforced door thats gonna be a much  higher number so /none/ a lot of what youre doing is youre judging how difficult a challenge currently  is versus what a player is trying to do the player rolls and adds their modifiers you decide  how difficult it is in the back of your head you can tell them if you want to or you can keep it in  your head and then roll off and see if it succeeds or not and then based on if it succeeds  or not you tell the players what the consequences are of the circumstance really low rolls can make  for /dung/ some hilarious botches really awesome rolls can make for some great heroic moments so you  wanna judge that aspect a lot its a lot of what your job is as a dungeon master youre also to  rationalize the world around them so if we can keep the volume down just a little bit guys its  all good its all good its all good so rationalizing the world around them now what i  say about that is when they encounter npcs which is a nonplayer character anyone thats not  controlled by the players and they have /dung/ a conversation or they do something in front of  them that nonplayer characters gonna have a reaction so you as the dungeon master or game  master you decide based on what theyve done or what theyve said the personality of the  character that youre playing how they would react to that circumstance favorably  unfavorably and so a lot of your experience as dungeon master is rationalizing that relationship  back and forth if theyre a really charismatic character that comes reads the npc well and kinda  sees that maybe they dress well maybe they like /none/ a lot of money and so they open the  conversation about money and how they can be paid thats gonna be a very favorable reaction so if  theyre trying to convince the npc to do something you might consider a relatively low  difficulty if its a progressive conversation and the player keeps bungling their words or rolling  poorly throughout the conversation that difficulty might get higher and higher by the end  of the conversation for them to finally convince them to do something so youre constantly  gauging how well theyre doing in a social /dung/ encounter versus how easy it is for the npc to  believe what theyre saying also youll find challenges that are conflicting or versus where  the player rolls versus an npc an example of that would be someone trying to deceive somebody to  lie to somebody versus their insight and so what youd do is the player if theyre trying to lie  to an npc theyd go ahead and roll add their deception skill and then me as the dungeon master  or you as the dungeon master would roll a d20 add that npcs insight skill /none/ and if you havent  decided one you can make one up on the spot based on how insightful that kinda npc might be and  compare the two if they lose theyd probably believe the player if they win they dont and  its your decision whether or not they wanna show that card or go along with it secretly knowing  that they were lying and then have that bite them in the ass later on so you wanna be a fair judge  and rationalize the world around them and how npcs react to what theyre doing /dung/ one of the biggest  aspects of being a game master or dungeon master in my opinion is understanding that youre here  to tell a story and youre here to allow the players to be heroes the reason you play this  game is you want that heroic journey and there are many people that enjoy games that are very  versus very conflicting and very like dungeon master versus players trying to kill them  theyre trying to survive and thats totally fine too just make sure up front that you and  the players discuss what kind /none/ of game you want to play nothings worse than having a player sign  onboard make characters get a few sessions in and realize that theyre now locked into a  campaign that is very aggressive and very fightandsurvive versus what they wanted was a  very plain happy yknow fantasy experience so make sure that youre very open with your players  in the getgo what kind of campaign you want to run in my opinion its the most fulfilling if  its a collaborative experience where you provide challenges you provide difficulty you provide  high stakes and /none/ there is that threat of death but you never want the players to feel like youre  working against them you want to be a kind of an impartial judge and be firm but fair which is  why its so scary sometimes when they get close to a tpk because i set it up a certain way they  play it a certain way and you let the dice fall as it does or in some cases it works in their favor  like a longstanding boss fight you prepared a lot that they happened to roll really well /none/ on and kill  your beholder totally fine laughs good for them cause who knows whats coming next so  present challenges present difficulty but never really with the intent to make the players feel  like theyre unfairly being beaten down and youre just trying to kill them off in some powerhungry  spree cause it just generally ends negatively and badly also in that same vein you want to  reward good thinking guile and good incharacter actions and roleplaying and punish reckless  againstcharacter behavior a good example was pike as a cleric early in the game /town/ she was  yknow beginning to be a little cruel and yknow while she is a war cleric and combat and  battle is not unfamiliar to her cruelty was and unnecessary cruelty began to fall into a negative  point of favor with her deity sarenrae causing the holy symbol to begin to crack and were kinda  seeing where thats gonna play out down the road conversely if someone does something really cool  incharacter or something that really kind of changes the dynamic or has everyone else at the  table going like whoa thats really great /none/ and maybe you want to reward them with an inspiration  dice which is if you guys have seen the inspiration mechanics you can lend inspiration  dice to players which allows them to give a bonus to one of the rolls they make our bard scanlan  can give those out as an ability but you as the dm can also give those out if somebody does  something really cool and if someone does something really risky but really crazy dynamic  even if it seems nearimpossible let them try let the players try things that are crazy /none/ they  might have a really low chance of working and theyll fail spectacularly and those will still  make for great stories and great memories in that game so yknow let the players be heroes  present them with challenges reward them for good incharacter decisions and try and detract them  from making outofcharacter decisions that take and rob the fun from the other players as well i  mean everyone can play as they want to if youre running an evil campaign or you have an evil  character in a game thats like starting to undermine /none/ the rest of the party that can be  interesting as long as all the players understand and are down with that type of experience once  again thats the conversation you have at the beginning about what everyones trying to get out  of the game then another job of the dm and one of the other larger jobs is you build the world  you build the world you help the players tell the story and you work together to find where the  storys going from there ill get into more detail with that shortly but you /none/ this is your  tale you can either buy an existing module which has a prebuilt world and you can customize it  however you feel you can play it stringently as to how the modules built you can expand upon it  or you can do what i do with this and just build everything from scratch and see where it goes  its a lot of work and the dm does have a lot more time they have to put into the game but its in  my opinion one of the more fulfilling experiences you can have /none/ as a gamer because you get to watch  all these people play in your sandbox and build their own sand castles and its kind of exciting  to watch them flourish in your own creative space and play off of you so i yknow while i do  complain on occasion i dont get a chance to play too often the experience i have watching other  people yknow find these moments they yknow its to me its fascinating and very rewarding  so i know its a lot of frontloading on this but laughs just trying to explain /dung/ to you the  gist of this so as a dungeon master you want to be a fair judge you want to rationalize the world  around them you want to try and make sure the players have the opportunity to be heroes and have  those heroic moments reward them for doing good cool things try and detract them from ruining  other peoples fun or doing things that are out of character and build a world for them to play in  so in these books and in any rpg book there are many rules about how to /none/ do combat how to do  social interactions and you can read up on that you can take a look at whats in there and  understand you can play these by the book completely as they are inside and its a great  rule system it works really well but everything in here in all these books are guidelines  anything can be changed anything can be altered anything can be customized to how you want it to  be if you dont like how movement or actions work in the game you can change it however you see /dung/  fit and just notify the players thats the case of course otherwise they might feel a little  yknow taken advantage of if they dont understand the changes youve made but you can  change and alter anything you want in the game its just guidelines for you to play off of i  know ive homebrewed a few things and occasionally aspects of being used to pathfinder bleed over as  well but you just take it as it comes the bottom line is as a dungeon master or as a game master  its your world and /none/ you can your word is law people cant really argue with you unless its a  rules question that you didnt clarify before in which case you kinda have to go in the favor of  the player if its something you didnt clarify but for the most part you play the part of the  overall god of this world and the players also have to respect that what you say goes thats  kinda that weird dynamic between the players and the dm its kinda its a respect mechanic you  dont want the players to lose respect /none/ for you because then they stop well partially enjoying  it but also they start feeling that antagonistic relationship which can be a little stressful for  both points so customize the rules as you see fit we homebrewed percys gunslinger class over  from pathfinder because we just when we converted over there was no equivalent and so we  made something up and were trying it out its a workinprogress its by no means perfect but it  seems to be doing okay and it keeps it fun for him without completely changing the dynamic of the  /none/ character he already created i know theyll probably release a gunslinger equivalent in the  future or something and it might be vastly different from what he has but were gonna stick  with this because its what hes used to and its what hes built his characters personality and  combat around so yeah just keep that in mind the next bit and this is kind of a big suggestion  point for a lot of you guys a large part of the dms time is spent worldbuilding i say  worldbuilding its creating all the little details and /dung/ the aspects of the world you want the  players to play in there are parts that like creating a society building towns and villages  designing dungeons and encounters all that crazy stuff all comes together into that world that  youre creating shh shh shh shh shh shh shh thank you we have to keep everything down a  little bit but you want to start somewhere and it seems very daunting as a dungeon master  especially a new one to say how do i how do i create all this how do i where do i /none/ start  and thats a difficult question sometimes for your first couple games it doesnt hurt to look  at a module go out and pick up one of the existing dungeons  dragons adventure books that  outlines for you how a city would be built how npcs would be built and how they would play out  and respond to certain circumstances its a good way to train yourself to see how that process  would look when its finished so if you decide to create your own campaign or customize aspects you  know where to build /town/ off of if youre building your own world id recommend starting with a  small society a small village or a small town and youre like okay im gonna build a small  town wheres this town gonna be whats the topography youre like okay it can be like in  a middle of a forest village thatd be more naturalbased kind of farmer society or it could  be your archetypical urban environment with a very thriving trade society a mercantilerun yknow  people it could be a port town it sees a lot of trade but also has /town/ that kind of travel aspect  its a mixing pot of cultures or it could be just a small farm town thats constantly under siege  but you want to start with some bastion of civilization some place where the players can meet  other characters find adventure find quests and find conflict so you decide okay where do you  want this small town to be as an example well say this is yknow well use the first town  they started in the campaign stillben stillben i built as a swamp town it is a port town but /town/ its  built in this clutch center portion of a large swamp to the far east of that continent so youre  like okay its a swamp town how big is it you think about it youre like how many people  do you think live there lets say maybe maybe 600 people its not a huge town its not very  happy living conditions cause its very humid there the swamp air itself is not very enjoyable  to be around so it doesnt have a huge population but those that do live there  consistently they make a /town/ good living cause they can live through this whole horribleliving swamp  experience and can make use of the trade that comes through so youre like all right about  600 people or so then you start breaking down into what factions there might be in that city  is there a thieves guild or an element of shadow in the town is there a merchant guild is there a  builders guild is there a sailors guild think of what type of work would be available in this  town and you start building factions based on that when /none/ you have a faction then you can start  fleshing out npcs or nonplayer characters that fit in that faction is there a thieves guild  how many people in the thieves guild would it have a leader you dont have to worry about  fleshing out every single member of the thieves guild but consider like two or three main npcs  that might be part of that thieves guild so you can say all right one of them will be well  say a female tiefling whos good with longswords shes trained into longswords youre  like all /none/ right cool so you can just write up her name come up with a random name you can  look up online for random npc name generators and write down her name well say for this  shes taken her virtue name of edge well call her edge so edge is a female tiefling leader of  the thieves guild now edge what about her aside from being good with longswords is a  dynamic aspect of her personality well is she ornery is she very sly and charismatic is she  the kinda person that lets everyone else do /none/ the dirty work and just stays in the shadows or does  she like to be kind of the faceman of the thieves guild kinda just decide some sort of a  personality aspect to her of those or many other types you can go ahead and say all right well  say shes charismatic as some tieflings get a bonus in charisma so she likes to be kind of the  speaking mouth of the thieves guild so youll say shes charismatic shes wellspoken and  she does well in social environments a few quick notes about her personality /none/ just to remind you  later on if she pops up how she would play out shes charismatic then you think and this is  one thing that i think every npc you should write down some aspect of what do they want and what  do they fear you can make a shitton of really simple npcs with just the information of their  name what race and class they are what they want and what they fear and thats all you really need  to branch out any conversation or encounter they go through so for edge what /none/ does edge want edge  wants respect and money as edge respect and money cause as the head of a thieves guild  those are the two things that guide her yes  orion are you gonna do the backgrounds for them  matt well get to that when you finish all the rest of the stuff  marisha were doing backgrounds now  matt well you can do your backgrounds on your way then well go through it its fine  marisha yeah but do it do the background  matt its fine so so she wants respect and /town/ money what does she fear she fears being exposed  to the masses for her demonic blood knowing that this is a suspicious town you can go that route  or you could say she fears being discovered by her longestranged demonic father or you could say  that she fears she fears being alone and she surrounds herself by thieves and folk that fear  her because it allows herself to feel like shes in control of an aspect of her life these are all  different possible fears you can go with im gonna say she fears being /town/ found by her demonic  father and so those notes there say shes a female tiefling shes a rogue with longswords  she seeks money and respect she fears being discovered by her demonic father these are all  you need to now play that character and you just need to put those notes aside and if the players  ever find their way in that town asking around and discovering where a thieves guild might be or if  theyre finding where like they can find a fence to sell stolen goods to or to find information  about /town/ the seedy underbelly of the nearby town of stillben in the swamp they might find different  people willing to give that information depending on how their social rolls are if theyre  persuading well or if persuasion doesnt work you can intimidate the information out of somebody  in which they scare someone enough to eventually give up a name and theyll say edge edge is  the one you want to talk to when they ask around and start finding more information about edge  they could decide to infiltrate the thieves guild and find her personally that /none/ might be a little  aggressive and you consider if a person breaks into a thieves guild the thieves guild will  take that as a sign of aggression and will probably meet them with battle if they instead  try and find a member of the thieves guild and parley with them they could persuade them to  speak to edge on their behalf in which case they might actually have the opportunity of speaking  with her onetoone in a notquiteasaggressive circumstance it can go any which way and thats  kind of the the interesting part of /dung/ being a dungeon master is you never know what the players  are gonna do you set up these characters you set up this world and you kinda let them play and all  youre doing is reacting to everything they do rationalizing how the world would react to what  theyre doing so lets say the players are like okay they asked around they found somebody who  did some work with the thieves guild they intimidated some information out of them about  edge you then find somebody you think may be associated with the thieves guild and /tavern/ you pay  them a lot of money and persuade them to go ahead and speak to edge on their behalf asking that she  would meet with you at this inn at this time your party then goes to that inn room and waits for a  while over a short period of time it seems like shes not gonna show up based on how you think  she would react to that experience id say shes curious enough that someone sought her out that  she would want to hear what they have to say cause there might /none/ be money in it lets say the  party has gained some renown in the local village perhaps she wants to align herself with these  upcoming adventurers theres always money to be gained there so you have her knock on the door  as the party enters the door theres nobody there but at that same moment they hear the  sliding of glass turn around notice that she slipped in through the back window and is now  leaning against the back wall with her arms crossed waiting expectantly for them to start the  conversation since they /none/ so openly sought her existence so now theyre in a conversation with  edge you can decide how to play their personality if you want her to be as charismatic  as you said before she would bow deeply you could say that she was happy to introduce herself  and while hearing some things about the party shes eager to understand what it is they might  have to do with her let the party explain now what it is that they want from her then you  decide does it fall within the respect and money she wants /town/ she could tell them ill help you  with this circumstance as long as you pay me this much or conversely ill help you with this  as long as you can talk to soandso in the town and get them to drop this bounty on my head  yknow you think of what things would fall into her wants and needs the party could do for her and  in turn could help them however if theyve talked around the town they may notice that she  has demonic lineage and they might bring it up in conversation and /none/ see her reaction she might be  very good at hiding that aspect she might be able to yknow to say well yes im a tiefling  indeed but yknow that is not of my own doing the players could then go huh she seems  uncomfortable im gonna roll an insight check on this then roll an insight check they roll a  d20 adding their insight skill the dm then you privately would go ahead and roll a deception  roll or a persuasion roll depending on what you thought was the circumstance for that versus  their /none/ roll and let them know what they read off of her awkwardness if they roll really low youd be  like she just seems put off by the fact that youve never seen a tiefling if they roll really  well you could tell them that at the notion of tiefling and demonic blood she fidgets and looks  over her shoulder seemingly like shes afraid somethings following her then the party can  press her in that regard and begin to say things like well if you arent gonna help us we have  a warlock friend who does /none/ dealings with the infernal and we know your name now if theres  someone chasing you yknow we could call them on you unless you help us now it becomes as  opposed to a persuasion it becomes an intimidationbased experience and if they can  manage to convince her to help out of sheer intimidation and fearing for what she doesnt want  to happen she becomes an ally although a much more tenuous relationship so thats an npc that i  just made up right now and fleshed out but really the basis you need for an npc /none/ to build  off any of those circumstances is a name a race and class what they want what they fear those  are some of the biggest things you need to everything else can be improvised on the spot  like i said its all reactionary as a dm which is great because once you set the world the  players drive the story and you just react off what theyre doing and rationalize how the world  would react to it i understand this is a lot of information up front but im trying to get as  /tavern/ much information into this talk as i can cause we have a limited time and ive had a lot of  questions today im trying to get through for you guys so i hope this has been helpful well get  to questions in a second so i can answer things specifically to you so thats an npc you can  create you can create the same way for like a local cleric a barkeep you could be like his  race he could be a dwarven barkeep hes not even a fighter or maybe he once was a fighter /tavern/ but he  gave up the life used his winnings in some sort of a brawling ring when he was younger to buy this  tavern and thats all he really does but hes wellconnected and has information what are his  wants he wants money but he also wants to possibly purchase a tavern across the town that is  failing that he thinks could expand his business what does he fear being closed down or possibly  getting arrested because of maybe some things he did in his past that are a little shady that he  hoped /town/ nobody would remember so now when someone talks to that innkeep there are many different  ways they could take that conversation and many different little ideas you might have as gives as  to what theyre seeking and what theyre afraid of and those are just cool little notes you make  to yourself down the road that if they ever decide to enter that tavern and talk to that npc you  look down and you immediately know where they stand what they want what they dont want and  how they can help or hinder the npc /town/ or the players based on what they do so thats building  a very small town and a small npc you flesh out a couple and then you build off from there and it  takes some time yknow you can crank out a few npcs and you can railroad it as much as you want  to if you dont want to spend a lot of time building a big sandbox game for all your players  you can play a pretty standard straightforward story you can decide the players are gonna go to  this tavern the players /town/ are gonna go to this yknow this home here theyre gonna go to this  one mercantile this kind of textile warehouse where theyre gonna find a hidden underground  passage that leads to an altar to some forgotten god in which case you can decide no matter what  happens you can send the players let them wander a bit and have fun but let them know very  early in you hear that there is some shaky business going on in this town people in the  tavern are whispering about these murders that have been happening in /town/ the village youre like  huh theyll start asking about the murders and thats when you can point them towards well  weve only heard yknow that these people have been being killed when passing around this part of  town and they arrested one man last week but he was let go from the suspicions and he lives at  this house now the players will be like oh well we have to go talk to the guy at that house  you lead them to that house they go talk to the guy the guy might be like /none/ i dont know what  youre talking about you press him for information you find out that he used to work for  this textile business and he eventually you can either drive that he helped with these murders or  that he knows who is and they work with this mercantile then now you send them straight to  this warehouse that contains all this yknow cloth and textile woodworktype materials they  might break inside search the place find nothing but if they roll well enough theyll find  the trapdoor that leads down into the altar so /tavern/ that was an example of a very thorough line to a  story that you could drive them towards and let them play within that zone if you have a lot of  free time you could build that you could build one storyline that deals with one of the local  lords that is in danger of having his home completely taken by him because of debt or you  could do another sidestory at the same time that has something to do with a local inn that their  basement has recently had a sinkhole collapse underneath the /town/ bottom of it that opened up a  cavern of a bunch of strange mutated yknow rats that are coming out of some terriblesmelling  cavern and all of these can be just aspects that are in the town at all given points in time the  players may find and you let them discover that it still takes a little more time to prepare that  but thats up to you as a dm as to how much your free time is and how much you can prepare for  yknow dont be afraid to if you dont have /none/ a lot of time to railroad the players a little bit  as long as you make them feel like theyre laughs theyre in control of it and they are in  control of it too and ive had a lot of games where ive prepared a bunch and the players  decided to go this way and completely get around everything i prepared and it turns into  this big improvisation experience and that can be very uncomfortable for a lot of people that arent  experienced in a lot of improv and thats where preparation comes in and /none/ kind of your comfort as a  dm i recommend if youre playing and dming or gming a game for the first time maybe run them  through a story thats a little more linear a little more direct so you just get more  comfortable with the experience both combat with the players more experience with how npcs  interact with them and being prepared for those circumstances then as you have more experience  as a gm or dm you can begin to be a little more freeform with your storytelling setup and letting  the players kind /none/ of play in that sandbox that is the world youve created so those are some  guidelines for like a small village the factions are fun to create because you can have factions  that are allied factions that are enemies and that automatically leads in a really cool idea for some  story hooks where you have maybe a thieves guild has a huge rivalry with the mages academy one  believes that you know shadows is a real way to get business done in the local politics whereas  the mages feel that its more arcane understanding that /town/ both sociopolitical aspects can be  controlled by the arcane maybe you have one played against the others the players can choose  a faction to align with and theres a whole quest line that way but now theyve made enemies with  the opposite faction and now theyre having to steer clear of their side or they can try and  doubleagent for both but if that ends up going horribly awry they have now earned the anger of  both sides and might have to flee the town and never return so these are all different cool ways /town/  that you can set up faction versus faction or factions working together to give the players  story and investment in the world that you are creating now from that small town you can build  an even larger city meaning all those same elements i discussed you just expand upon you  build more npcs you build an entire district that is shops and stores maybe in a giant bazaar you  can create a whole district that is just about worship of different gods and deities and you  have different temples assigned to each god and /none/ you can find you can use the gods that are in the  book you can create your own gods that have their own backgrounds and specialties and guiding  principles and religions around that its up to you but as you build a larger city you have to  consider how many different people and cultures its now having to house and facilitate so its a  little more of a time investment to build a city that much larger but its a really cool  experience to then have the players wander through that to continue to discover /none/ like the main city  of emon which you guys have heard about a little bit of but im sure well come back to soon in  the campaign you guys will have the opportunity to see it in person is a vast city much like the  classic baldurs gate or neverwinter its the central capital city of this entire region and  theyve only maybe experienced a fifth of it after a whole almost entire year of exploring it so  there are a lot of examples of that urban expansion that they can go through and to /none/ be  perfectly honest ive detailed and fleshed out maybe about a third of the village with loose  notes for all the rest so if suddenly one of the players veered right again and decided to go all  the way to the far northern slums which i have nothing really specifically planned for i can  look through my notes and find out a handful of npcs and some loose story elements that i made  notes of about those northern slums and i can kind of improvise based on those notes and where they  want to /none/ go in the story to still make it a fleshed out story and if its a really heavy story thread  that theyre following i can just find a way to tie it back into the original thread i was trying  to tell and not necessarily guide them back on the path but have it still fold into the same story  theyve been discovering you never quite know where theyre gonna take you sometimes the  players take you on a ride and you just kinda have to go with it you dont want to deny the players /none/  too much because youre all in this for that storytelling experience and they want to feel  like theyre guiding their own path if you force them too hard against their wishes in the game  then it feels more like the dm is playing the game than the players are and that becomes a very  tenuous relationship going forward in a campaign the cool note is the players never know whether  or not youre bullshitting or you had it all planned so even if you go off the rails as long  as you have some /none/ notes or are at least acting like you know what youre talking about for the most  part youll be fine ive had whole games that have gone by ive run by the seat of my pants  improvising and i just i dont know whats going to happen and it works out in a really crazy way  and finds a whole new story path and you just dont tell the players that that happened  laughs thats a fun little aspect there so we talked about urban environments weve talked  about cities a bit you know which /none/ in those cities you want to also be mindful of what ruling  class there is is it an oligarchy is it a lordship is it a kingdom is there an elected  official is it a township and that political structure will also be a very very good way to  build those factions below it as well so the larger your city is the more elements of that  social structure you have to consider and how many layers there are beneath it is it a very wealthy  city universally is there a very very you know /none/ high disparity between the upper class and the  lower class these are all really cool ways to flesh it out and give you ideas on where npcs can  be and where tension is in that society also remember just because youre in a city doesnt  mean there arent dungeons castles and keeps have dungeons some cities are built on the ruins  of older older cities that may have underground cavern networks that have been long forgotten or  tombs that havent been touched in years since a strange wave of necromantic energy began to rise  /tavern/ things from the grave and they just seal it off but who knows what lurks beneath there or like  earlier at that tavern i told you about that had a strange sinkhole thats a really cool story arc  to lead into an underground cavern network to something that may have caused the sinkhole something long  forgotten beneath that inn that now threatens the inn or possibly the town its entire self you  know dont be afraid to have players in a city environment still find creepy interesting weird  terrain within that city environment in emon /dung/ the players managed to fall through a cistern into a  deep dark underground cavern network that led them through an ancient ruined city finding a hag  that managed to make a proposition with them whereas for information leading them out she took  a bit of tiberius luck he still doesnt know what that means and it still floats above his  head i think hes forgotten about it but a portion of his fortune has been stolen by this  hag it still resides in that realm so urban environments can be urban but dont be afraid /none/ to  explore avenues above and below how you doing how we doing  marisha pretty good  matt cool bit im gonna finish up here real fast with some other ideas so those are cities those  are towns what makes them so special is in the  dd world and in a lot of rpg worlds outside of  those bastions of civilization is a very dangerous world and you can change that up however you see  fit but i find that it definitely makes for a better environment if the players understand that  in the /town/ wild you find things that are wild there are creatures that roam free there are monsters  and beasts that call these places home and need to eat and survive there are intelligent entities  that are building their own civilizations in the darkest depths of the mountains or in the shadowed  patches of the local forests and going outside of a town most traveling caravans need to have  muscled support hired to come along the way if you travel alone there is always the possibility  of bandits ransacking you on the road or some sort of /town/ large hulking beast comes tumbling out of  a nearby cavern structure and attacking the you know the people theres so many different ways  that you can incorporate a dangerous wild world around these bastions of society these little  points of light that makes the game feel more dangerous it heightens the stakes for the players  whenever they have to travel and it makes returning to a town that much more of a breath of  fresh air then consider villains villains are npcs that inherently have very selfish goals that  are detrimental to society at /none/ large andor the players kvarn being the big bad of the recent  arc he is definitively one of the main villains if not the main villain of this arc you can  create villains that are kind of oneoffs like this they eventually found kvarn and they killed  him you can create villains that are longstanding and recurring like earlier in the  campaign the dread emperor was always present but they didnt even manage to find him until the  very end that was a recurring theme throughout kind of built that tension about that villain and /none/  not all villains get killed some villains when theyre damaged they get the heck out of dodge  and return later even more prepared and more ready you know but sometimes the players can be  clever and keep them in there and dont deny the players if theyre really smart and prevent your  villain from escaping when he tries to cause you dont want you want to reward the players for  being really smart remember good villains are also very smart and usually have a pretty strong  exit strategy if everything goes to shit so /none/ villains are a really cool thing to flesh out  their persona and their personality you look at a lot of great literary archetypes that can expand  on that for you you consider like you know the chaotic eviltype villain which is the joker from  batman someone who just like loves the idea of violence and destruction and ruining the world  around them for their own personal enjoyment and personal gain you have the lawful evil villain  more of the darth vader types that work in a structure of law but use it to their advantage /none/  they twist peoples ideals of honor and society and relationships to put them in a position of  power in which no one can really contradict what they say goes and through that they maintain  power and they maintain control over people around them then you have just general evil you have  all sorts of different types of evil archetypes you can play with in there but have fun fleshing  out a villain and having them be as sadistic or as controlling or as charismatic and enjoyable for  the players to encounter as much as /none/ they hate them you know you can have a vast variety from there but  recurring villains are a fun theme and generally up the experience more than just having a big bad  every session that they go in and kill get the loot and leave you know its fun to have that  recurring element im gonna cruise through a couple of points here for you guys so we can  start getting to these guys to playing here or any questions they have for the story story  hooks story hooks are essentially what gets the players /dung/ to start seeking the story and theres a  lot of great examples in the dungeon masters guide here if you guys pick up a copy that  explains a lot of different ideals of how you can get the players invested in your story lets see  if i can find it real fast back here but essentially a story hook could be when they enter  a tavern they notice that someone in the corner is hunched over and eventually falls forward off  their stool the party goes and inspects and finds out that theyve been stabbed /none/ and are bleeding  out and in their dying words they reach up to the player they whisper a name like oh shit what  is that name what does that mean and someone in the room is like that name thats the name of  the leader of this one temple of pelor the god of the sun the god of light okay well the players  now have the idea that someone got murdered and their last words were the name of this person  lets go find out what their relationship was thats a story hook someone /none/ got murdered  mysteriously and you only have a name to go off of thats an example of a cool story hook that  the players might be interested in pursuing some players might be ah fucker died whatever and  that story hook goes away but thats up to the players and thats going to put them in the  territory of being a little more neutral to evil than good players so if they make good characters  and they do stuff like that repeatedly they might start pushing into the evil territory and  maybe drawing the /none/ ire of other npcs nearby that are good the captain of the guard rushes in and  inspects what happened to this man and youre like i dont know he died hes like grrr i  dont like the look of these people who dont care about the lives of others maybe going forward  whenever they encounter the captain of the guard he immediately mistrusts the party and theyve  already established that relationship negatively so lets see whats some other good examples of  story hooks they have here in the book sings 71 and 72 well see /dung/ if theyve got that up all  right bear with me as i pan through and like theres a lot of great breakdowns for villains and  npcs and stuff in the players handbook guys so if youre planning to dungeon master a game i  highly recommend you read through its a really really great resource ah all right 71 all  righty so there are a bunch of cool dungeon goals and wilderness goals like foil a villains evil  scheme destroy a magical threat inside a dungeon acquire a treasure rescue a captive   these are /dung/ cool dungeon goals they have it broken down into wilderness goals as well like  establish trade with a distant town map a new land find a natural resource escape the  reign of a tyrant and you have other cool ideas for goals defending a location from attackers  retrieving an object from a caravan infiltrate a fortified location successfully travel  through an obstacle course to gain recognition or reward these are all very loose very simple  story hooks and goals that you can then weave a story around based on how youve built your town  /none/ and youve built your npcs so dont be afraid to go ahead and grab a copy of these this can kinda  be used as an example if youre feeling a little lost through their story you can actually just  roll randomly on these players and be like all right what are they doing today oh well ah  looks like theyre infiltrating a fortified location let me come up with some bullshit that  you know justifies what theyre doing so you can technically dm a game randomly by just  rolling off these and improvising from that /dung/ point forward thats a little more of an advanced  dungeon master technique if you really feel like just winging it from there but thats a really  cool resource to have at your disposal another question another thing i wanted to bring up with  you guys was encounters so when you do get into battle or when players encounter creatures or  monsters or villain characters and they want to fight you then go into an encounter and you want to  consider when you prepare for encounters you think where are they are they fighting in a /dung/ dungeon  or are they fighting in forest or are they fighting in a swamp are they fighting in an open  plain and you go through a book like the dungeon masters or sorry the monster manual and find  creatures that you think would live in that type of topography so if theyre in an open field you  can think of more wild beasts or you know clans of roaming orcs if theyre in deep deep  mountains you can find creatures that burrow and naturally live in more earthybased terrain and  you build encounters around /none/ that there are some really great websites online that have encounter  calculators where you can basically tell how difficult an encounter is based on how many  players are in the party what level they are and you can build the encounter based on that that  way you dont end up accidentally making something thats too difficult or too easy for the party  and you dont want to make everything too hard some battles can be fun and easy and really kind  of have the players enjoy being badass and rushing into combat and just killing /none/ things really easily  and being haha i ruined everything thats great i am powerful and you can have some  battles that are pretty phew that was close that was a good fight and then occasionally you  want to throw them a curveball and have something they really have to struggle through so when they  finish that battle they really have to take a rest and realize we almost lost one or more people in  that fight and that makes the stakes that much higher at that point but you dont want to  constantly be /none/ hitting them with superhard battles you dont want to be making things  consistently too easy because it isnt a fun challenge for them and consider terrain for  combat too not every battle is just you versus monsters sometimes theres a big cliff involved  and the battle could be at a distance sometimes theres pits of lava in the middle and that  becomes a danger or a tool depending on how you look at it during the battle sometimes  especially in urban combat you have rooftops and alleyways in which you can use that to your /none/  advantage to avoid things or push guys off a roof to fall and get hurt or fall onto things you  know there can be traps involved that you know are there that you can then push guys into  theres a really cool way of building encounters that are beyond just hitting things and doing  damage which is fine too dont get me wrong also if theres a monster in the monster manual  that you like like this is a really cool monster but its too easy like the players are  all level ten and /none/ this is a level three monster you can customize the monster you can make the monster  more powerful add more hit points raise the stats a little more give it a couple of unique  attacks that you think would be fitting for it if you dont like the fact that the bulette only has  like a bite and stomp attack maybe you decide that this bulette actually grew up or was raised  around some sort of arcane natural arcane relic that infused it with a resistance to magic and a  capability that it has like /none/ electrical charges around it and now when everyone whenever anyone  starts their turn next to it they get shocked its an electric bulette thats kinda cool why  not you can customize and alter any aspect of any creature in the book once again all guidelines  you can go with the basis here and its a lot easier if you dont have a lot of time but dont  be afraid to customize and alter things to fit certain aspects of your world or your story as you  see fit its great i had the players in /none/ this campaign fight a protolich when they were level  three or four liches will wipe the floor with pretty much anything but i considered it would be  cool to introduce that powerful undead aspect if it was like just barely cresting out of its  initial ritual to become a lich in which case it was in a very weakened state so if they had  waited a day or two that lich would have ruined them it was still a tough battle but they caught  it when it was still essentially birthing which made it a /none/ very very weak lich thats not in the  books i just took what was there and scaled it way back that made for a really fun encounter  so all guidelines you can customize as you see fit and there are great communities online of  people that create creatures or beasts and have suggestions or feedback for anything you create  dont be afraid to reach out there once again i apologize because this is a lot of information up  front for trying to squeeze this in for you also maps you see in critical role we /none/ do combat with  maps that we draw up of terrain and we have everyone has individual models and the creatures  have models that is not necessary i have found its very helpful for our campaign because we have  eight players which makes it very difficult for everyone to keep in mind spatial awareness during  the battle who is who and what theyre doing and how close monsters are i grew up playing dungeons  and dragons and other rpgs without maps or models at all it was all theater of the mind all in the  /none/ brain which is a lot of fun but when you get a certain critical mass of players it becomes  unwieldy so the the models became necessary for us but what were doing tonight when we play our  game theres going to be no battlefield no models its all going to be just keeping it in  your head and me letting you know whats happening and where you guys are so dont feel like its  absolutely necessary to do that i just find it makes it easier when you have more players and  its fun to /none/ draw maps sometimes its a lot of fun to do that another question that has come up a  lot experience points so monsters that are killed or defeated in battle give you experience  points they dont necessarily have to be killed to get that experience points if the players still  win the encounter meaning they forced them to surrender or they managed to fight them to the  point where they have to retreat that is still a victory and the players should still get the  experience for that encounter you may give them a bonus /none/ if its a big boss fight and they killed it  and then get to reap the rewards of it thats cool thats totally up to you as a dm but you  know if they still successfully complete an encounter they still get the experience if they  flee from an encounter and the players technically lost the battle you can still give them a little  bit of experience to gain from that but it would be largely docked by that and thats totally up to  you thats combat experience what about roleplaying experience thats arbitrary based /none/ on  what you want to do as a dm you can just write down well thats cool they get five hundred  experience for that social encounter you can make it up on the spot and i recommend keeping an eye  on what level the players are and what the experience values are for each level so you know  how much they need to get to the next level that allows you to kind of build a structure now for  me to keep track of roleplaying experience its an endeavor with eight players so what i /none/ do is i  have what i call a hatch marks system where whenever anybody does something in the game thats  a cool roleplaying experience or they save a circumstance i will give them a hatch mark next to  their name or multiple hatch marks if it was really really clutch and really kind of changed  the dynamic of the circumstance and saved their bacon or if they failed miserably at something  but they gave it a really really good try and it was a cool idea i might still give them a hatch  mark /none/ or two cause it was a good shot and so at the end of each game i have a kind of an equation  for myself where i multiply their level by 25 so right now theyre all level ten it would be 250  experience and thats i give them that many i multiply it by the number of hatch marks they get  so if somebody gets three hatch marks in a game right now they would get an additional 750  experience points at the end of that session based on the roleplaying experience so that way /none/ i dont  have to think too much about the math in the game i just go thats cool hatch mark that was  really cool hatch mark hatch mark hatch mark and then at the end of each session ill go ahead  and multiply the level by 25 and then multiply that by how many hatch marks ive given them and  thats their total roleplaying experience thats worked well for me its not for everyone but i  think its a good way to quickly add up those moments and make sure players dont feel like  /dung/ youre slowing it down to keep track of whos done cool shit thats a really condensed overview of  dungeon mastering um  laughter  marisha an hour later laughs  matt theyve asked me a lot of questions via twitter and thats kind of what ive built this up  for so i apologize for you guys thank you for being patient were going to take a couple of  questions from the chat room and then were going to go ahead and start the game here in about 15  20 minutes or so so as i said /dung/ i hope thats a lot of information for you guys but dungeon  mastering its a lot of fun it takes some time you have to kind of set aside some time i say  generally it takes about an hour of gameplay per hour of preparation so if its going to be a  sixhour session it might take anywhere from three to six hours to set up for that properly but it  doesnt have to be that long thats just me being super thorough which im obsessive about but  yeah be open to improvise be open /none/ to let the players play and let them guide you sometimes in  an offdirection and have fun let the players be heroes let them try anything just know that if  what theyre trying is really ridiculous they have a really really low chance of succeeding  and most of the time theyll fail and its a spectacular failure and youll all laugh about it  if they succeed that roll that is an epic fucking moment that youre all gonna remember because  that player pulled off that thirdact amazing maneuver that completely changed the dynamic of  /dung/ the story and thats really what this game is all about i still remember and tell stories from our  campaign like it was something we all personally did and experienced its really weird its  weird i love it but its weird so i love it playing the game is great learning the rules is  great dungeon mastering is a lot of fun its scary at first but i guarantee with a little bit  of time its really rewarding and its really really not that hard at all so yes lets answer  a few questions in /none/ the chat room guys lets see if you can chime in on this well take about ten  minutes of this and and then well jump into the game with you folks and once again thank you  for thank you for your patience  marisha im pretty stoked for the characters  matt i am excited  marisha weve got some good stuff going weve got some good stuff going  matt actually as a note to remind you guys too one of the cool things about fifth edition two  things they did they got rid of a /none/ lot of the floating modifiers that previous editions had  like you know pathfinder was one was a great system but i found in battles especially with a  lot of players youd be like all right so i get plus one to hit damage from the bless spell  and the bard gives everyone plus two to hit and damage oh no its just hit no its to hit  damage okay and youre going to plus one from that ability but only within ten feet of them  marisha dont forget enhance ability  matt right enhance ability /none/ all right is that a plus two from  marisha hey dont forget hey  matt  so its plus seven to hit plus nine to damage on that  marisha the hunters mark hunters mark dont forget hunters mark  matt well we still have that problem but thats laura  laughter  matt but that became an issue with a lot of big battles i found especially with eight players  so they simplified that in this edition most modifiers to hit and damage are pretty consistent  you dont have a lot of crazy things what they /none/ do have is advantage and disadvantage if an  experience or a circumstance in the game puts you in an advantageous position you get to roll two  d20s and drop the lowest so you get the higher of the two rolls if you have disadvantage you have  to roll 2d20 and drop the highest which is rough so thats a really simplified way of kind of  playing spells to give you the advantage or get enemies disadvantage in that circumstance which  is great another big thing to consider for fifth edition is and you guys went /none/ over it a little  bit backgrounds not necessary players that are new to the game might find it very interesting  but when you ask about your characters background and what theyve done where they come from and  how that builds them as a character you can completely come up with whatever you want to you  can say they came from this background they did these things and this is all in my head in how i  plan the character some people either are having a little bit of writers block with their  character or /none/ they dont know where to start or they just dont have a lot of experience theres  a great section in the new players handbook about backgrounds which you get to choose where your  character comes from where they grew up they could be a folk hero they can be a charlatan  they can be an acolyte they can be a soldier from a war long past they can be an entertainer and  that gives them bonus proficiencies in their skills that pertain to their background and it  gives you examples of certain personality traits that /none/ you can choose or randomly roll from for  example go to the background section of the players handbook over here you can find where  is it  marisha actually dan made his character with his background this way  dan its true  marisha so we can just hear about his background as an example  matt right so lets go ahead and hear about your background dan  dan all right clears throat  marisha but he did roll a dice to randomly generate it  dan i did i generated it randomly flip the appropriate page /none/ scottish accent so im salty  pete the first mate of the obsidian helen a sailor by trade a scoundrel by nature  laughter  dan the captain gambled with the ship so i fed him to a longbeaked squid with razorsharp teeth  spent times on pontoon cigarette boats skiffs whoring snoring and deploring across the land  im married to the sea but me best friend is a hermit crab named terrence  laughter  dan the only leftover i have from the helen is her flag which i wear like a cape ive met many  friends /none/ over a buttery glass of chardonnay sailors choice  laughter  dan but ive lost many more if you step to me you best come correct im on a quest to regain  the helen i play for pink slips looking for clues at the bottom of a glass oh you bet your  arse i did and now i fell in with a failed warlock named the snugglelord  cheering  matt and all that of was based on randomly generated information in the background section  marisha he clearly fleshed it out which is incredible  dan i /none/ added some flesh  matt it gives you a great basis to build off of like i assume you were the sailor  dan yeah i went for the sailor archetype its super cool because i really liked stuff like that  back when i used to do campaigns because it gives you a great basis just for you know if youre not  sure what you want to do with your character it gives you good branchingoff points and they you  can just sort of add meat to that skeleton  taliesin well its also one of the /none/ questions i hear from like people who havent played the game  before when you first start with character creation is like well what are the rules on what  i can be and kind of trying to get them out of that there are no forget about the rules what  do you want to be this is like this gives them a little set of rules that they can kind of grasp  onto desperately for like their first game  liam well never  marisha some of my favorite oh go ahead  liam but well never /none/ forget oh and im eating chicken you go ahead im eating chicken  marisha ill go first some of my favorite characters that ive played with have all been  people who decided what they wanted to be first and then picked a race and a class around what  they wanted to be so our good friend paradox really wanted to be like a roadie who  laughter  marisha he wanted to be a roadie essentially like a traveling circus who was like the curtain  guy for all these bands and so he made a monk who /none/ had these ropes and he had a whip and all of his  abilities he would grapple people and tie people up with his ropes and that was like what he  based he had an idea first and then built a character around so cause the system is so  flexible you can itll allow you to be pretty much anything you want to be  matt yeah  marisha so one of the things i like in pathfinder theres like you can make a geisha  dancer who did damage with fans so you can pretty much be /none/ whatever and then  figure it out from there  matt if its not in the books you can create it you can build it we made the gunslinger off  pathfinder here for that so like its totally open and the backgrounds are a great way they  have a whole section for personality traits and you can roll for a personality trait or multiple  and ideals so things that really drive your character in their life bonds things that really  hold them you know via loyalty or to an ideal beyond that and then flaws which /none/ i love like  right here i rolled a two as a sailor id say anything to avoid having to do extra work thats  a great flaw for a sailor probably not great for his work ethic but you know but those are really  useful things the backgrounds is a really cool addition for those who want a jumping point for  building their characters personality ah lets answer a few questions in the chat while were  going about this  crew manoose asked how do you handle magical items  matt how do you handle magical /dung/ items  taliesin marisha and matt very carefully  matt the dungeon master guide actually has a really good breakdown about in the magical items  section about the cost and rarity of magical items im just going to pull it up here real  fast theres common common magical items cost between 50 to 100 gold pieces and it says  character level first or higher uncommon also first or higher but around 100 to 500 gold  pieces rare magical items are from fifth level or higher around 500 to 5000 gold pieces then very  rare and /none/ then legendary which get higher and higher from there legendary being 50000 gold  pieces and more and so that helps you kinda gauge how easy or hard it is for players to find  something of that level and each one of the magical items in the book tells you if its rare  uncommon any of those type of circumstances however it gives you a range so you as the gm or  dm you decide based on how powerful the item is how much its worth if the players wanted to sell  it or buy it /none/ and generally you consider if players are selling magical items theyre selling  lower than they would buy it from like any sort of pawn shoptype thing they might get a quarter  of what its worth at a store but if theyre really charismatic and theyre really good with  their persuasion rolls they might be able to get more money than that or conversely lower the  price of items they want to buy so you wanna make sure you dont want to give too out too many  items throughout the campaign quickly because then the players /town/ either get too powerful and then any  items you give them down the road seem not as interesting or flippant i like to run a campaign  that has you know occasional upgrades just a little slow trickle with bursts of good item use  that way when you they do find something truly magical its a aw nice as opposed to oh  its another boots who wants the boots thats ive already got like three here you have that  you know it becomes less interesting and less special to me so i like to trickle them /town/ out and  keeping tabs on what players have what theyre missing and then eventually kind of incorporate  aspects of what they can upgrade their characters with down the road or they can create them for  themselves there are rules for creating magical items if they have an arcane practice  to their class  taliesin were sponsored by a store ingame too  matt you are sponsored by gilmores glorious goods those of you though you have not been  there yet so  marisha oh my god i forgot were sponsored by them  taliesin we /none/ are sponsored by gilmore  liam eventually you will all have the pleasure to meet gilmore  orion gilmore is fantastic  marisha i love gilmore  orion fantastic fellow  liam hes a little sweet on me  matt gilmore is a fan of vax  marisha a little thing for vax  crew nsfthermont asks to what degree do you allowencourage the players to contribute to the  worlds lore  matt all right so how much do i allow the players to contribute to lore for their character  backgrounds i like them to contribute a lot /none/ about where they come from and what their stories are  everyones backgrounds you see in the opening videos they wrote themselves and then i take  those and i incorporate that into the world that im creating and occasionally theyll cross paths  with aspects of their personal history and in the future will as well some of them will just be  breezing through encounters some of them will actually find moments in the story that will  directly be part of their personal goals that will we shall see i like the players to  incorporate aspects /none/ of their history but beyond that i dont want them to flesh out too much of  their current or future aspects of the world because to them that takes out some of the mystery  what i think is great as a player is knowing where you came from and not knowing where youre going  so like for instance tiberius  orion yeah lot of you asked about my mending wheel cause ive used that a bunch and the  mending wheel is part of something that tiberius personal quest is about that i wrote and gave to /none/  matthew its like this is  matt like two years ago  orion yeah its like over two years now wow its been a while but i said here this is what  his goals are this is why hes travelling with this group of people and that is like when i  found that thing he doesnt make it you know very difficult but he doesnt make it easy  either like when we came across it there was this npc witch right  matt it was a hag you heard me mention her earlier  orion and /none/ we had this interaction where he it was about something else our main quest that we  were doing and he said he was describing her place and he said somethingsomething wheel  just and was listing things and i was like wait a minute thats one of my things i think i  wrote about and i then as tiberius inquired about it then that became a conversation between  me and the npc and i had to does that apply now is that gone  taliesin no thats not gone  orion quietly oh no  marisha that /none/ piece of fortune you handed over  orion i had to negotiate some of my fortune which i still dont know what that means  marisha no thats gonna fuck us so hard one of these days  taliesin oh one of these days its just gonna hurt  orion but i had to give that to the witch npc in exchange for the wheel of mending which is the  very important thing in my quest so  taliesin and its been helpful for everybody  orion its great  marisha its been very helpful  orion its been /none/ great  marisha one of these days though youre gonna like get a  orion really horrible  marisha youre going to roll a 20 and something terrible is going to happen  orion but the cool thing is i didnt describe what the wheel did i named what they were and  matthew then decided if it a if it was existed b what it did and you know how it worked and  all that stuff so thats its cool  taliesin you know having details but having the dm giving the dm discretion to decide how it /none/  plays out is really awesome  orion and marisha yeah  orion because then im surprised and im the one expecting to see it im still surprised  and its great  matt well like well for instance the city you came from draconia the society youve given me  a lot of information about how you grew up there and kind of how you saw this society and then you  sent me that outline and now im taking what you had come up with and im fleshing it out and  building it into the world and /none/ then running with that essentially so tiberiuss memory serves  right to what his experience was in draconia well see how that continues going forward when he  eventually returns to his people so  marisha and i did something similar with like my four tribes of the ashari you know ive got  ive got the fire tribe and the earth tribe and the air tribe and the water tribe but from  keyleths perspective im from the air tribe i dont really know a whole lot about the other  ones theyre there so i gave him the /none/ idea of the tribes and the backstory that they exist and now  hes fleshing it out for me  taliesin yeah and like i dont know what the people who came to my parents castle wanted they  were looking for something and like i gave him details on what they were doing but not  necessarily what it was all about because i dont know but he knows because he gets  to figure that out  matt yeah its fun  liam laura and i spent three hours in a diner fleshing out our family history  /none/ marisha thats so cool  liam it was great it was great  matt then you ran into your estranged father and his new family laughs  taliesin oh that was so great  orion yeah that was like their father was a big part of one of our main quests it was insane  liam it was very frosty  marisha it was very frosty yeah  crew skyfalls1 asks a specific about trinket im just gonna generalize the question how do you  handle playercontrolled allies and their level progression are they part of the character who  /none/ controls that ally such as trinket being the bear a familiar or something or do they have  their own independent leveling guide  matt for this system and its different from system to system in this system that companion  trinket is part of the ranger class the beastmaster that laura went into and trinkets  progression is tied towards her progression as her level gets higher trinket will have more hit  points trinket will gain better bonuses to his attacks as her proficiency bonus gets higher so  trinket will advance pretty much alongside vax or vex /none/ youre not wearing your shirt shh  laughter  orion you need to always just wear that shirt  marisha see im not the only one  taliesin gonna get a tattoo  matt im usually very good about that its been a long week i always say that but yeah so  playercontrolled pcs like that those are tied to the class as far as npcs that i control that  arent part of the party those i keep tabs on separately entirely so we can get a few more  questions in here  marisha dont saw off /none/ ifys arm dont nope  matt he needs that  dan just some real chill larping  marisha put it down  liam how will he make himself happy at night  marisha drop it drop it  liam thats the good hand  orion while were waiting id like to address a couple things that ive been tweeted at about  roleplay and what i think about roleplay and how im super hardcore about it i always tell people  whos kinda like wanted my friends who are like i have no idea what that is and i was /none/ like the  best i can explain how i roleplay is as soon as i sit down and as soon as he says the narration and  then we get into it i immediately just pretend im like 12 years old again and im this guy im  this kid and i have my or ten or 11 however i dont know age anymore ten  taliesin seven  liam 11 and a half  marisha 12  orion where imagination is the strongest where i put on my sheet and wrap it around and thats my  cape and /none/ i have my flashlight and thats my lightsaber or whatever the hell and i go outside  and play til my mom comes to go have dinner or whatever and im dirty as hell when i come back  inside everybodys done that weve all been kids  marisha well that was like two weeks ago for you  orion im just saying also when i play dd  taliesin im wearing my underoos right now  orion thats where i go its just when everybodys not thinking about any kind of thing  other than having fun thats my /none/ best advice to just kinda roleplay just have fun  taliesin and ill say something that actually came out i was very very proud of this that this  came up recently in some conversations as we were talking about the nature of playing a game like  this and about risk and as a player wanting to be adventurous and wanting to do things you  wouldnt do in real life and one of the essential things that a good dm that you get to learn with  a good dm is the dm is not there to kill /none/ you the dm is there to turn you into a hero  orion um by the way i have been playing this wrong all the time  taliesin im just kidding  laughter  taliesin you play awesome shut up  orion because no cause we had this conversation yesterday  taliesin just like we were gonna die and he doesnt want to kill us laughs  orion and i was like i dont understand mercers trying to kill us all the time and hes  like youre wrong he wants to make you a hero and im like what /none/  laughter  orion but that means everything ive been such a dick  taliesin hes hilarious  matt some dms do want to kill you  taliesin and orion some dms do  matt which is fine as long as the dms and players agree upon that at the beginning and  theyre like this is the relationship im trying to kill you guys good luck surviving  like tomb of horrors its a perfect example of gygax going fuck all yall youre gonna die  thats where that stems from and for some people thats a lot of /none/ fun but for this game death is  very real challenge is there and i present circumstances that depending on what you guys do  may or may not end in success or death but im not trying to outwardly kill you usually  marisha hes not trying to outwardly kill you  zac spiritually kill you obviously its had some effect on you  taliesin hes god its scary  marisha he is scary  orion its just like an armored fucking enchanted horned beholder motherfucker yeah sure  hes not totally trying to kill us  marisha we /none/ say fear the wrath of god for a reason  taliesin if a giant god appeared tomorrow and like just pulled out a d20 and rolled it and  looked at you youd freak out thats a really scary thing to happen  orion but it is a good point like i shouldve been more i shouldnt have been  so fearful as i was  taliesin its just a different way at looking at the situation  orion im literally thinking hes  taliesin i know because he gets that look  matt its part of the fun  /none/ taliesin his smile is so terrifying  liam i think i play i court death on purpose  laughter  liam the way i look at this is either this month or next year my characters going to die i know  thats going to happen and i would never grab a rope and jump off the side of a flying device to  save my actual sister yes i would  matt yeah you would  liam yes i would thats a terrible statement yes i would  laughter  liam but i dont think that i would leap /none/ off of things to my detriment constantly and like  thats the whole reason were doing this is cause were 12 and we get to pretend were the  heroes so im constantly trying i fully expect you to kill me someday  matt it may happen and im gonna feel horrible  marisha dd has a lot of life lessons in it were all gonna die someday yolo  taliesin three ranks in yolo  matt you can be as careful as you want in a game but you get to a certain point where you have to  /none/ have those hero moments where you take that highrisk highreward  marisha it sounds like youre being a little bit racist right now  liam hold on hold on hey shush say that again  matt being careful is great and working your way through a situation carefully is fantastic but  you reach a certain point in a game where you have to let yourself jump into those highrisk  highreward circumstances because not only is that what you dont get to do in your daytoday  life but those make the best stories success or failure there might /none/ be serious ramifications for  failure but god damn if you wont be talking about it for the next two or three ten years for  the one time that you did this and it failed and your character got smashed in this horrible way  and two years after your party would clamor to the gods your lost characters name whenever they  charged into battle against a great foe like thats the kind of storytelling you dont get  unless someone takes a risk like that  marisha by the way when one of us dies were all /none/ gonna fucking bawl our eyes out  orion i know  taliesin oh yeah  marisha its sad  taliesin but scanlan and the stainedglass window will live with me forever  zac im gonna feel really bad laughing from the back of the room when that happens  haha this is great  liam youre wearing a unicorn suit  crew so im gonna do two more  matt two more questions okay  crew first one i cant remember whos asking it but ive seen it a couple times theyre asking  about dm player characters your opinion /none/ on dm pcs  matt dm pcs if theyre a very good dm can be fine i honestly the main reason i became a dm  was because my first dm had a pc who then somehow got all the best loot and was a paladin in second  edition but also somehow had the samurai kit which i dont know if that can be a paladin so he  was dualwielding magical katanas and whenever an upgrade came up that he randomly rolled on the  table he went oh cool im taking that dude i dont even have /dung/ a magical weapon hes like  ill fight you for it im like oh good paladin fuck this shit ill make my own game  sorry ray i love you but that was a terrible game  laughter  matt but i think if its a good dm you can but the problem is as a dungeon master you know  behind the scenes you know where its going you know whats coming you know what youre gonna  fight you know what to prepare for you know whats gonna drop you know so much that having a  player /none/ character almost defeats the purpose  liam almost completely completely defeats the purpose  matt there are circumstances where it might work with certain creative types but i think it robs  you of the fun of actually being a player in the game if youre also the dm conversely it also  marisha well you also i mean you have this handy screen deliberately so we dont see what  youre doing  matt conversely the other players feel removed then because they have this strange magical  godentity that also is fighting alongside them that has the benefit /none/ of knowing whats coming  dan sort of a tangent to that question how do you feel about another player playing someone  elses character by proxy when that other players not there  matt i think thats totally fine if the players agree upon it i tend to just npc players if  theyre not there or try to find a story reason as to why they cant be available so it doesnt  rob them of the experience but that is totally a viable thing as long as the players agree to it  or if the person /none/ was a real ass last game and theyre not there like you know what fine you  control the character  laughter  matt see how they like that but for the most part if players are okay with that and theres  somebody at the table that they trust to understand what the character would do to play  them properly then fuck yeah go for it great  orion matthew thats why im going to be showing up next week  matt okay  orion i will be ill be here  crew so for the last question /none/ i want players at my table to be more this is cometcalvin by  the way i want my table to be more immersed in the story like instead of saying to me so i  tell them to go west are there any tips on stimulating people to rephrase it how do you  encourage people to roleplay more and get into character rather than simply just direct commands  at each other  matt right right so to get people to roleplay for one thing i wanna mention its not necessary  if you want that in a /none/ game thats different  marisha bullshit  liam there it is  marisha its a roleplaying game its in the title come on  matt let me clarify  marisha go ahead  matt some people dont have the comfort level or have the social confidence to be able to jump  straight into character and so for them its more comfortable to play it that way where they  can remove themselves from the character and control them almost like a video game and say what  theyre doing as opposed to actually performing and acting it out and /none/ theres nothing wrong with  that if anything thats almost a babystep version of them eventually becoming comfortable  with fully immersing themselves in the character so i dont think that you should be down on  somebody who plays that way necessarily if you want to immerse them more as a dm its an  invitation you mention to the players guys going forward i would love for us to be a little  more into the circumstance if youre feeling comfortable please feel free to speak in  character or sometimes if theyre down for it but they /none/ have a hard time committing put the law  down anything you say in this game is in character if its conversational to where if they  turn to somebody on the side and be like i cant believe you stabbed them in the back be like  im sorry what did you say and then you start treating everything as character conversation  then they are put into a circumstance where they have to treat it like that it may not be  comfortable at first but just like getting into the very very cold water in a pool /dung/ at first it  sucks but over time they get used to it and they dont realize that theyre there anymore after a  while you know it just becomes natural but for you as a dungeon master you really have to its  an invitation a comfortable invitation please come with me on this id love to have you be more  involved in this and its your job as the dungeon master to also bring your npcs to life in the way  you want them to roleplay and when you ask them a question dont ask it /tavern/ out to the whole group  pick somebody in the group that npcs looking to and go you what are you doing in my tavern  liam i was just passing by i thought i could have a drink  matt yet your eyes seem to belie some sort of strange negative connotation you carry a blade  out of its scabbard what is it you want with my belongings  liam nothing my father gave it to me i was just thirsty and passing through okay  matt your father  liam my fathers name was arthis he was /tavern/ a potter and he asked me to come to you and ask you for  your allegiance to our clan  matt thats all you had to say come have a seat well discuss this clans allegiance  liam youre a very nice fellow could i also have a drink  matt for a gold piece you can  liam heres two heres two im rich  laughter  matt i see you speak tavern well so like thats a circumstance where youve kind of put  them on the spot and they have to react to it and like /none/ i said it might be weird at first but  theyll eventually get into the deal thats my suggestion it might not always work some people  just arent comfortable with that and you have to be okay with it  taliesin you do setting really well too like when we would play the lights go down the  candles come out the music turns on  matt thats one thing i do miss about this situation is its hard to adjust the lighting  based on circumstances  zac were working on it man all right were working on /dung/ it were getting there  matt its all good  liam in a dark fantastical cave  zac were working on it  liam  also known as traviss dining room  laughter  orion but we put a nice tablecloth on the table  liam cant you also use im dming for my eightyearold son and these kids i havent done  this yet but the dm book talks about rewarding them with inspiration dice so cant you like as  a carrot just start anytime anyone shows even just the barest glimpse of roleplaying like that  go /none/ boom inspiration dice to you  matt yep yes i mentioned that a little earlier and ill expand upon that on top of making sure  people get bonuses and little bumps for cool experience moments if someone does something  really cool in character you as the dm can reward them a d6 as an inspiration dice an inspiration  dice and they can only carry one at any given time but at some point later in the game if  they have to make a d20 roll like an attack or a saving throw or a skill check /none/ they can add the d6  to their final number to give them that extra little hero push towards succeeding at something  so its another cool kind of carrotonastick bait to step a little harder into their character  and really play out that role good point liam we may have time for one more quick one since  there were a lot of questions coming through and then well jump into the game  marisha i will say while youre looking for a question  crew whens there gonna be another shirt are you guys planning on doing /none/ another  matt were planning to do more shirts geek and sundrys putting up their actual store soon and  so were going to be  zac i would like to take this time to say that we do have shirts for sale right now that support  geek and sundrys overall twitch channel if youd like to purchase some they are the hr emote human  resources stapler for whenever you say something inappropriate like penis there you go you have  a shirt for that  orion thats inappropriate penis  zac well i mean  dan in /none/ this context yeah  laughter  liam were playing a board game  zac depending on where you put it  orion oh sure  marisha yeah just like real life anyway  matt i saw one good question i wanted to address someone asked suggestions on running a complex  system for a bunch of new players which is a challenge even sometimes in our game still but  its one of those circumstances where you have to be patient and honestly you can simplify the  rules when i say you can customize anything in this book you /none/ can leave out a lot of the rules  and just keep it very simple if you dont want to have if you think a movement an action and a  bonus actions too much get rid of the bonus action and just consider things find another way  to work it in or if you want to keep it a little more freeform and just keep it open to it puts  a little more work on you as the dm to do so so you have to rationalize what theyre doing so it  doesnt seem so broken /none/ but you can just minimize a lot of the rules you can cut out half the  skills if you dont think theyre necessary you can get rid of feats you can get rid of  backgrounds you can halve the spell lists if you want if you want to narrow it down you can go  through and trim and trim and trim until you think you have a nice simpler system for everyone to  start with and then you can start rolling out the more expanded aspects of the system so dont feel  like you have /none/ to verbatim hand everyone this book and be read it all lets go you can go ahead  and pick the few rules you think are important to play the game teach them to your group and just  start with those and then slowly as time goes on let them research and discover more  as they go on  liam and learn together  matt yeah  orion to what youre saying too what matthew i dont how to say this what matthew allows me to  do is for all you casters out there if the spell /none/ isnt in the book ask your dm if you can craft  them ive matthew has if it doesnt exist hes let me make spells thats what glacial blast  is it doesnt exist here but i was like hey i wanna do this thing that doesnt quite isnt  described in here so you can ask your dm and he can figure it out with you i of course always  give him waytooop stuff hes like no and then he gives me an actual spell it works  taliesin everything i build is literally just me handing him /none/ a slip of paper going eh eh  matt and the players as they submit custom things they have to understand that you do your  best to balance it and if they try it out a few times and its still kind of overbalanced it  might be scaled back a bit cause youre still trying to find what works and you cant really  tell how balanced something is until you try it but thats kind of the relationship you establish  with your dm if you want to customize and create things on your own is like /dung/ can i do this sure  but make it like this okay lets try that play a few games yeah its a little powerful were  gonna scale this back a little bit and dont be like come on you said it was okay be like  okay okay cool  dan also earlier talking about customizing monsters for the encounter its either in the dm  guide or the monster manual there is an algorithm in there to properly scale a monster up and down  to fit the needs of the dungeon i dont know where it is /none/ in there so thats a tool that they do  allow you to have  matt its in the book its nice  dan it is in the monster manual  matt i think so yeah  dan i think so i was trying to i remember flipping through it i knew it was one of those i  just wanted to mention that  liam its in the facebook terms of service  dan page 94 section a3  matt all righty so lets go ahead and  marisha should we trade places so that some of us are /dung/ sitting next to them  liam were not us arent we just spectator  taliesin were just spectators  matt you guys are spectating for this  marisha but i didnt know if we wanted to help them  taliesin phone a friend  matt all right so lets go ahead and begin and im going to preface this letting you guys know  that i have nothing prepared this is an entirely improvised session im curious to see where it  goes this is a perfect example of flyingbytheseatofyourpants  dungeon mastering  liam whispers its going just like /none/ how you rehearsed  orion whose line is it anyway matt  matt this is a propbased skit carrot tops dungeons and dragons ladies and gentlemen  liam oh god  matt i know all right so dan we saw your wonderful character your sailor dwarf  dan salty pete  matt yes correct  marisha salty pete  matt zac  zac im gonna let him go first actually  matt ify what you got  ify yo this is ulfgar fireforge im a sellsword expit fighter im slow to trust and  quick to kill money talks bullshit /none/ walks just so yall know im in it for the money and i play  a mean flute its sharpened at the end so if you get too close i might stab you in the neck but  just know ill do anything for a buck anything  dan anything  ify anything  matt what was your guys name again  liam i cant wait for zacs monologue  dan salty pete  zac i am the great snugglelord a charismatic charlatan from as a warlock tiefling individual  hailing from the land of sippletint i became bored with /none/ my homeland after impregnating all of  the impregnable and decided to pledge my loyalty to the overlord of a faraway land and set off to  do his evil bidding im not really evil though the overlord himself asked me to do a lot of very  evil things at least thats what the voices tell me along the way i learned that i was more of a  lover not a fighter so i lied to these two assholes about the pleasures that await them at  the overlords chat room theyre dumdums and fell for it and /none/ now act as my personal bodyguards  basically in short i convince everyone with intimidation and my great charisma but im very  broken and weak physically on the inside  laughter  zac actually im hearing some voices from overlord right now i believe were at 3162  subscribers and the chat i told you the chat room was real and if the chat room could respond  with the keyword snugglelord  crew its not working  zac i heard from one of overlords minions that the giveaway is not working  liam creepy voice the giveaway is /none/ not working  zac and theres nothing that he can do about it in his current situation so were going to ask  that the great fellow lad nightbot pull the winner for us for the giveaway  ify i dont know what the hell this dudes talking about but he paid me so  zac i brought a lot of money lot of money with me on this trip thats all  matt great so you promised them what awaits them at the snugglelords or the overlords  zac basically the seven virgins of the chatroom  matt okay /tavern/ got you all right and so well okay all right so heres how well start  liam the gears are turning  matt upon your chance meeting one evening in a darkened drunken tavern in a darkened drunken  state upon spinning tales of your backgrounds your ears perked up at the promise of not only  great riches but great soulful gratifying angelic entities promised to you from the realm  beyond this overlord this overlord that keeps a very very carefully hidden temple of worship not  too far from this city no more than two and a /none/ half days travel on horseback you mention to  them that there is a place a grand place where this temple could be found and deep within  resided the secret of contacting and being taken into the riches the eternal vault of what is the  overlord upon this agreement a small bit of change was exchanged you managed to finagle the  local stable out of a couple horses and found your way traveling before daybreak you ride and ride  and ride for the next two days an awkward series of camping circumstances allow you to find /none/ you  dont have a lot in common based on conversation other than the love of money and the love of this  promise they give you and the further you travel the more and more the baneful eye of mistrust  begins to fall upon one snugglelord as the beads of sweat drip down your face but you know the  city is mounting soon there will be a time where you can prove to them that in some way shape or  form they have helped you find what it is youre seeking and you can possibly kill /none/ them before they have the  chance to take you out nevertheless as the second sunrise hits you crest over the last of a  large hilly landscape the high grass brushing past your boots as you push through these  grasslands and you see upon the fabled city of rockmarr rockmarr not really that fabled its a  small farming village he seems to be talking it up as this grand city so theres a moment of  disappointment as you look over and see what may be anywhere from 60 to 70 houses to hovels to a  /none/ slightly dilapidated farmland bit of confusion hits you and you look over to snugglelord as he  puts his hands up  zac yeah it was the voices i mistranslate them sometimes  dan you mistranslate its 60 fucking hovels  zac 600 60 like one  dan you dropped the zero  zac well its an accident  dan great  zac it wont happen again look youre a great dude i like you dude i get along youre great  youre great  dan hands off the keg youll smudge it  zac you got my back though /none/  ify you pay me ill kill him right now hey you pay me right now hes dead  dan whoa whoa whoa  ify ill kill you right now i told you you pay me more ill kill him ill kill anybody for some  money  dan ill put in my pink slip this is a bit im willing to take  ify yo how much money you got right there  dan lets find this overlords stash  zac did i really have to pick the two dumbest assholes to be in my group i mean really /none/  dan im getting so tired of this outer monologue lets find this its gotta be one of these 60  hovels lets find it  ify all right lets do it  zac what are we looking for again  dan youre the one whos supposed to know were looking for your mythical chat room whatever that  means as far as i know it said something about virgins about riches about ladies  ify see thats all i care about  dan right im looking for helen whos a ship its more of a metaphorical lady but ill /town/ take  any port in a storm  laughter  ify you give me that boat ill kill him right now  laughter  ify you give me that boat ill kill him right now  dan oh well talk  ify all right i like boats man shit  matt as the tides of your relationships quickly seem to turn as you head towards the town you  notice and youve traveled here once before and laughs while you understand that secretly  beneath where this hidden chat room is is a cache of money that your previous employer /dung/ hid amongst  other riches and probably murdered most of your allies before you managed to escape from his  clutches and probably the only person of your band of roving thieves and miscreants to not fall  to the shadowed blade you know that his riches are held there you know that there are a number  of traps set within this dark underpassing and you know that once you can just get there safely  you can probably make it out alone so just hold tight to your position and you should be fine as  you ride /town/ up to the outskirts of town you cant help but notice that strangely what was once a  bustling farming town seems fairly empty the nearby grass seems to have turned from a brightish  healthy green to a dull crackled browngrey the farms themselves the lands have turned dark and  cracked the landscape appears to have been untendedto for many a month and aside from a  couple of scratching sounds and a distant cawing of crows overhead as they flutter off into the  distance there doesnt seem to be much of a sign of life in /town/ this village  liam whispers psst the music changed  zac whispers i heard it  liam whispers be careful  zac whispers yeah  marisha whispers its a clue  matt as you begin to step into the village proper there is a small thoroughfare that leads  from the main area towards the center part of town as you ride in slowly the clomping of your  horses hitting against the rock and dried dirt beneath your feet you catch what looks to be a  handful of individuals gathered towards the center of town maybe no more /none/ than 150 feet away you see  four figures all different heights dressed in ragged rags and clothes that seem to have been met  with some sort of hardship and long long nights without any sort of cleaning agent they gather  around in a circle over what looks to be a well  dan hello there what are you looking at in that there well  matt as soon as you say that loudly the heads suddenly spin to you  dan creepy  matt look amongst themselves and they all begin to scatter away from the well /none/  zac can i make can i give him some money to go check and see whats in that well  matt okay  ify you can give me money to do anything  zac heres some shillings there dude  dan its a local currency  ify okay man you just wasted your money cause i was just going to check to see if theres  money in this well anyway so a little more would be go though  dan for wishes  ify im gonna look down and see whats in here right now  matt so /dung/ as you approach the figures have scattered off into what looks like two different  alleyways on the opposite side of this small thoroughfare you glance over the edge and the  first thing that catches you is this very very acidic smell this pungence that hits your  nostrils its like longlongrotting citrus combined with almost an ironlike scent you  glance over and currently you can only see a few feet into the darkened well and its too dark for  you to see anything beneath however you are as you are a dwarf you have dark vision /none/ and in the  lowlight circumstance from the noonday sun you are able to look down and see that the brackish  liquid what would be a normal watery well instead is very thick and viscous in the way it  slowly moves and from what you can gather the water is disturbed recently has been disturbed  ify huh thats good are there any shiny trinkets there like there might be some coins in  the bottom  dan anything glittering through the thickness  matt make a perception check  zac i think there might be coins in /none/ there if you want to jump in and see whats at the bottom  matt so go ahead and roll a d20 add your perception skill  ify so my perception get plus two 19  matt 19  ify nice  matt you take a moment and you curl your fingers along the outside of the stone well you place  your head down and while the scent is not pleasant the need for gold is stronger and what  little bit of light trickles through you can see what looks to be a semblance of a step or /dung/  something within the well that catches your eye and indeed you see a handful of gold coins youre  not sure how long theyve been there tossed in either as a wishing well or something more but  there are apparently some coins within the liquid  ify all right i learned a few years ago you just cant stick your hand in any kind of water you  know your hand might get bitten up maybe i might throw a piece of rope in there see if it  disintegrates if not that golds mine i saw it /none/ first you will die if you touch it  dan ah the old rope test classic natures litmus  ify my man sam over here knows about that rope test yeah ill throw a rope in there  zac whos sam  ify my man money sam over there  dan its salty pete but sams me nickname  laughter  matt so as you go through your pouch you pull out a small wrapping of hemp rope begin to lower  it into the liquid as it hits the surface theres no hissing sound or immediate reaction it  /none/ seems you just kinda lower the rope a few feet in let it sit for a second and as you pull it  up you notice the rope itself has a very black color to it and as you pull it up you can see  there is a very very slight dissolving reaction on the rope itself  ify cant get my money  zac you might be able to jump in get a handful and well pull you up and  you could survive that maybe  dan i mean its hemp rope your hand is stronger  /none/ zac yeah i mean youre a big dude  ify see usually when two people are trying to convince me to do something and theyre not trying  to do it that means i shouldnt do it so were gonna sit here and were gonna talk about this  water how were gonna get inside it and get that money  zac all right well youre the seafarer what water what do you do with that  dan i know a brackish liquid when i see it this is nothing ive seen before not molasses not  swamp water this /none/ is nothing the like ive seen before but i never back down from a challenge i  thrust my hand in to grab the coins  matt all right theyre about seven or so feet below from the top of the well  dan oh shit  matt so as a dwarf youre on your knees like grunts  zac you need a little help there buddy  dan its all right im highly acrobatic  ify yo man you better find my money man you got me excited thinking you were about to grab  that money you got /none/ nowhere near my money  dan i forgot me stumpy arms  matt with the aid of someone else you could probably get in there if you want  dan would you be so kind as to dangle me  ify oh yeah you know ill dangle you  dan its a dwarf thing  matt so laughs as ulfgar grabs you by the ankles and slams you over the front of the well  you dangle down your fingers just reaching in towards the liquid you grab at the coins its  very very cold the liquid but it /none/ warms quickly as a strange tingling sensation begins to rapidly  encase your hand as the feeling begins to go numb your hand gathers a handful of coin and i want  you to go ahead and make an athletics check  ify all right  dan dont fuck this up  ify it hit the pencil  dan he fucked it up  ify the pencil messed it up 14  matt 14 okay so you feel the sweat beginning to pour down the side of your head your muscles are  tense but as soon as you see /none/ that gold vanish from beneath the liquid you know its in the  proper hands you pull him up out of the well without much issue you come up to the surface  hand clutching the gold and as you open your fingers you look and see indeed the coins are as  clean as the day they were almost like just being in that well took any sort of tarnishing material  off of the coin itself also looking down you notice that your hand has gone  from numb to burning  dan oh no  ify get /none/ my money first i take the money out of his hand and put it in my sack hes on the  ground throw some dirt on him i throw some dirt on your hand  matt you take two points of acid damage as the corrosive liquid eventually subsides the horrible  corroding of your hand but not without its impact  ify thank you for helping me out i throw you a gold piece  dan oh thanks for the tip  ify yeah you know  zac im sitting on my horse laughing my ass off this is /none/ hilarious im just so glad now that i  teamed up with these dumdums because this is gonna provide me with so much entertainment on my trip  ify you know we can hear you right you say it out loud we know what youre saying  dan

so glancing over i want all three of you to go ahead and  make a perception check  zac okay so what do i roll  matt roll a d20 which is the most round of the dice and add your perception skill to the number  you roll  dan 14  ify 15  zac 16  dan we are not /town/ clever  matt 14 15 and 16 all right so you being at sea for a long time the salty air seems to have  taken its toll and your eyes are still a bit fuzzy as you take to rubbing them to try and get  a proper view the two of you immediately see that in one of the nearby buildings a door is  slightly ajar and the moment that your heads turn toward it the door shuts almost reactively  zac weird  ify i say we go check that out  dan did you see /none/ something  ify yeah yeah a door shut it smelled like money  dan oh great lets find it  matt as you approach the door you go ahead and reach for the knob as you give it a turn and a  tense push the door is not opening it looks like the knob itself is either locked or being held  and the door is held in place  ify well it looks like somebody might be trapped in lets bust down this door man  dan i can pick the lock  ify all right  dan /none/ your choice dont want to take this experience from you  ify i think im gonna try to bust down this door first  dan have at it leading with your shoulder  ify all right  matt go ahead and make a strength check so just roll a d20 and add your strength modifier  dan did you pull something  ify eight  matt you get a nice running start foot goes right into the door and it solidly hits you and  sends you falling right back onto your ass nearly knocking the wind out of you /none/  ify out of breath no go ahead and get that lock first  laughter  dan this must be a powerful door  matt strong reinforced wood and iron  dan all right well let mrs buttersworth and the lefty try this one im gonna take my thieves  tools out and try to pick the lock  matt all right roll a d20 and add your dexterity plus thieves tools  dan okay one  laughter  matt as you stepped over  marisha this door is gonna be the worst boss in the entire game  matt /none/ pushing your dwarven ally aside you pull back your sleeves pull out your fine masterwork  thieves tools and jostle for a moment and you hear that wonderful sound that click which  displays the unlocking mechanism as you pull back you realize that wasnt the mechanism that  was the end of your lockpick breaking in the lock  dan oh christ  zac howre you dumdums doing down there  dan uh great its a powerful portal  ify oh man  dan i dinnae think it can be traversed we should go around to the back find /none/ a window  ify oh no im gonna deal with this house real quick let me just deal with this house  dan can i grant you a synergy bonus whatever that is  ify im gonna see

called thaumaturgy  zac thats what i was looking for  matt that allows you do all kinds of slight things especially you can create fire pretty  much within torchlight or a small handful of fire on command so as hes looking through his pack  zac im gonna let him keep looking for a little bit longer because it humors me  matt fair enough  zac did you find anything there little buddy  ify yeah i got /none/ a tinderbox in here uh  zac before he can finish his sentence i cast the fire onto the house i dont know  dan are you serious you could do that all along  zac all while sitting on my horse and smirking smugly  matt with a flick of his wrist a spark emerges from his fingertips and a burst of flame collides  with the upper echelon the upper portion of the rooftop the thatched driedout roof begins to  immediately burn brighter and wider and wider until about half the roof itself has caught flame  /none/ part of the wood surrounding the upper beams of the front panel where is the door is also begin  to catch and you start hearing some subtle coughing on the interior of the building  dan gotcha  ify all right yeah so now im gonna go punch his horse in the face and  then well wait by there  dan classic dwarven maneuver  ify right in the face as he laughs  matt roll a d20 add your attack bonus  ify goodness gracious  matt your strength and your proficiency  ify thatll be 11

matt your strength modifier yeah  ify so thats seven  matt seven wham socks your horse across the face as youre laughing midlaugh the laugh is  pulled from you as you go hahaha whoa as your horse falls immediately over onto his side  zac son of a bitch bastard  matt  sending you /none/ tumbling from the horse five feet from it on your side face in the dirt  coughing for a moment as your dwarven friend wipes his hands ulfgar kind of chuckles over you  marisha that poor horse  zac has the fire weakened the structure enough for us to basically jump into the building  dan into the inferno  zac i have a fire resistance spell  matt thats true so looking at it you can see the flames are starting to get and you notice  the door is trying to be opened but whatever lock mechanism /none/ has been jammed  dan sorry thats on me  matt you hear banging  marisha im pretty sure this is about to be manslaughter  matt from the opposite side of the door  ify i go over to try and help this dude out because i still think im the hero in this  zac yeah thanks for punching my horse dickhead  dan its all about perspective  zac i had a plan  dan oh you shouldve seen your face hes gonna

again  liam oh burn the people in their homes classic dwarf move  ify six  laughter  matt as you go /none/ charging headfirst this time towards the door to headbutt through a second  time you land on your back however whatever the impact you managed to jostle free whatever part  of your lockpick was stuck in the door which suddenly swings open smoke billows out into the  midday sun and you see a cloaked individual probably about a little shorter than you in  height comes rushing out coughing outward just trying to get a breath of fresh air  dan i saved you  ify who set your house on fire man ah shit yo your house /none/ got set on fire dude  dan is that door made of mithral  zac you look really weird why couldnt you just say hello you looked weird and we tried to get  in we couldnt you look weird  matt make a deception check  marisha deception check  ify oh of course now i do good i rolled a 19  matt a 19 okay the individual pulls back the hood and what you can see it was a ragged gray  essentially a cloak that was placed over with them you see their pants are kind /none/ of torn and  when the face is revealed its an extremely malnourished female halfling she looks like shes  seen some rough rough days she could probably pass for midtwenties or so but due to her  current state of health she looks much much older  zac i feel like a real dickhead  matt she finishes coughing she goes thank you thank you for saving me i appreciate the assist  zac well to be fair i mean he did fall on his ass twice and he punched a horse  ify yeah well that horse was /none/ just collateral damage  dan this is pure conjecture and hearsay  ify the horse actually im gonna give you the full story the horse was blocking my way to help  get you out of this house this uglyass horse all in my way anyway  zac is there a way to convince her that im the only person here she should trust  matt yeah tell her  zac im like look here little girl these guys are idiots you dont wanna talk to them just  talk to me like look me in the eyes talk to /none/ me lets talk this through like whats going on with  you whats up with you  ify yeah trust the guy who looks like lord hades himself  matt roll

persuasion  dan yeah persuasion  dan and ify so plus four  liam its high its high  dan so 21  zac 21 /none/  matt okay she glances at the other two dwarves who are both kinda like growls just general  stature and nature two rather raggedlooking swarthy gentlemen looks to you with your  immediately dangerouslooking tiefling face but theres something about your voice and the way you  spoke to her that is strangely welcoming especially in the chaos of this house nearly  burning down around her she reaches out and touches your hand gently and goes thank you  certainly weve been lost in this region for over a month now were looking for food were not  /none/ from here but when we came to this village it was empty everyone was gone no bodies no one  killed just missing just vanished but it seems the further we get from this place theres  something that draws us back to it we get thirsty we get hungry like theres a curse to it  that wont let us leave  ify oh well honey thats just you that was the rapture from the lord bahamut just raising up  all his dragonling followers and all that such and things  zac again he is not to be /town/ trusted he is an idiot  dan where are you drawn back to specifically  matt its hard to say were continuously brought towards the center of this village  theres a large platform where it looks like there used to be more of a presentory stage where  small events or at least the township would discuss but right now theres something that  keeps calling us back to that place weve set up tents there to survive in the meantime we dont  trust the buildings about i can show you  zac that would be great ill /none/ pretend to be your friend until we get there  dan why would you say pretend  ify why would you say that out loud  dan are you fucking serious show some discretion  zac you really want a friend dont you  matt i do  dan how does this work every time  ify i dont know man i think its the demon horns using demon powers and stuff you know i  need to go to church on sunday  matt follow me and she turns around and kind of puts her hood up and she /none/ darts down the  alleyway to the right of the burning building keeping away from the flames that are now  beginning to completely envelop the structure  ify oh excuse me  zac sorry about that by the way that was an accident  ify we dont know yeah whod do that  dan an accident by nature natures accident  ify why do you keep bringing this up when nothing happened man  dan yeah it just caught fire  ify anyway do you have any gold in that house is there any money in that house

get that hot gold man  zac keep your eye on the prize man  ify yeah we gotta look at this juice anyway tell her to take us to the juice  zac were going to the tents  ify oh all right  dan juice is a common dwarven term for tents its slang  matt as you /none/ keep walking along shes darting ahead keeping an eye out she turns around and  goes by the way lily  zac oh you have a name  dan or a favorite flower  zac one or the other name  matt thats my name  ify so im ulfgar you know im a sellsword expit fighter put your money where your mouth  is slow to trust quick to kill money talks bullshit walks laughs and i extend my hand out  for some dwarf dap  matt she reaches out and pats the top  dan classic halfling /none/ they always mess it up  ify its all good its all good  dan im salty pete but some call me sam  matt all right sam  dan you can call me salty  matt salty it is all right  zac i get the idea that you probably are without a father figure from the look in your you can  call me dad if you want  ify yo youre getting creepy man  matt well get home and meet my father  zac oh thats im snugglelord thats fine im sure hes a great guy /none/  dan close one  matt as she continues now with an awkward side glance  zac i cant bear children you know this  dan so sorry  zac i got it all out theres nothing left  matt as the alley opens up into this central essentially a small square to this village you  can see what she was talking about theres an elevated wood platform although its partially  collapsed in the center it looks like either something heavy was laid on top of it and it  eventually gave way or something heavy smashed it /town/ from up top and around the outskirts of this you  see what look to be about six or seven tents that are kind of a very small ramshackle tent city  they appear to be made from scraps of cloth that seem to have been salvaged from nearby houses or  storage facilities but as you approach she gives out a voice and says stoic serling we have  guests please at which point one of the tents opens up and you see what looks like an elderly  woman humanish from what you can see at this distance /town/ looks out and goes oh is that right  are they here to help and she says i think so i think so and she rushes out and helps the old  woman out of her tent  zac yes yes were here to help  matt at which point a secondary tent opens next to that and a large burly halfling steps out  older looks to be the one temporarily in command of this small group of people steps out so  youre here to help you say  zac highpitched yeah  dan aye messir were here /none/ to help  ify yeah if you got the money to pay us  zac god  ify big money hey so im gonna let you know im a sellsword and expit fighter slow to trust  quick to kill money talks bullshit walks lets kill somebody  dan weve got to get you a fucking business card  liam love that dwarven dialect  matt the gentleman kind of steps forward and looks at the three of you  dan dont leave him hanging  matt laughs he sort of just stares at you as youre waiting the laughs /dung/ the young halfling  girl lily comes up and pats you on the hand again kind of alleviating the tension  dan oh too slow  matt the man takes a step forward this time you can see definitely posturing a presence of  masculinity and control of the situation looks about the three of you and goes all right so if  youre here to help show me what weapons youve got  ify oh my favorite part  dan show me mine ill show you yours or viceversa sorry the salt has addled my brain  zac idiots /none/  ify all right so i pull out my two longswords so i got two longswords i use em at the same  time i like to call this one regina and this one lindy you get it right left haha im  hilarious and then i got this crossbow right here i use it with one hand itll bust somebody  in the face any questions  zac no i have no questions thats very nice  dan i didnt know their names thats beautiful thats great  ify yeah

cape which can come in handy  in case of emergency  zac i merely have this little axe its no big deal its not really a big deal and a crossbow  im not really that good in a fight  matt all right  zac these guys though theyre great you can use them for whatever you want  matt and youre the leader  /town/ zac yes  laughter  dan hes the employer  matt right  zac same difference  matt heres what you need to know weve been stuck in this place for at least two weeks now  were withering away out here little to eat no aids coming whatever darkness has taken root in  this small town ive come to believe has infiltrated the water has infiltrated the ground  beneath us the very earth itself as far as i can tell each night when we sleep the dreams the  nightmares get worse and worse i daresay if /none/ this continues for long im liable to lose my own  sanity and i want to keep my daughter safe from me so all the cash i have not more than a  simple 120 gold will be to you to distribute as you see fit  background noise  matt turn that down  marisha i made it silent  matt as the elderly woman goes im sorry and she puts her small violin away that she was  playing as her mind slips  zac i was really enjoying the music its quite fine  ify yeah youre /none/ speaking my language right now and im ready to do anything for you right now  dan id say youre right about the water  ify yeah yeah  zac lets the water is strange  ify first off its the juice obviously theyre drinking the juice they aint got no other kind  of water the juice making you crazy so we need to go up there and maybe you can use some arcana  to look at that juice in there and see whats up with it and we could get this money  dan i think we /none/ should check the area around the stage and see if theres an opening or somewhere  that we could get beneath  zac yeah lets try that  ify yeah but if you  zac im also a little concerned about your hand  dan its fine  zac youre not youre not like  dan listen im sorry i dont exfoliate like you tieflings do  zac im just you know like no weird things going on up there  dan no just the thought of getting my ship back and my shit together  zac all right all /none/ right okay no were cool were cool  ify no so do you want your ship back or your shit back that accent funny as fuck  laughter  dan oh yeah my accent dwarves am i right  ify you ever come up to the mountain with us mountain dwarves  dan we hillfolk are a different breed  ify yeah yeah man this is the mountain dwarves we keep it real  zac im terribly sorry i swear their muscle goes a lot further than their brains do though  matt best be for the coin im paying /none/ for this but well see prove your worth follow me he  leads you over towards the central stage in the middle of this open area you can see now the  stage upon closer inspection it hasnt collapsed it hasnt been smashed it looks like  the central area beneath it has been pulled down there is an actual what looks almost like the top  of an anthill like its slowly sinking into what appears to be some sort of a funnel that  disappears beneath the surface of the earth  dan well that looks unsettling at /none/ best  zac a little scary just throw your other hand down there and see what happens to it  dan im gonna try a different tactic id like to gaze into the abyss with my darkvision  matt all right so you have to step underneath the large wooden platform move through the broken  portion of it you can see where elements of it are jammed into this gravelly sand texture that  formulates this small funnel its roughly about 12 to 15 feet across and part of it does spill  out into the opposite side of /none/ this open area as you glance towards the edge you feel the sand  give a little bit under your foot  dan uhoh  matt go ahead and make a dexterity check dexterity saving throw  dan so that would just be  matt saving throw which should be at the top  dan gotcha a hot nine  matt as you look over and step you find the sand begins to slip from underneath you you reach up  to try and grab one of the wooden platforms to keep yourself stable however your other foot  that /dung/ you had your weight on also slips as the sand and dirt seems to give out under you entirely as  you hit your side you feel it actually beginning to cave inward and pull you deeper and deeper into  this small recess in the ground youre now up to your waist being pulled underneath the surface  you guys watch him being sucked in  dan a little help  zac grab him grab him get in there get in there  ify damn oh my god damn hes in there thats deep  zac jump just jump /none/ ill grab you  ify how much are we gonna get paid for this im gonna jump inside im gonna jump inside  zac i dont know just jump  ify im jumping inside come on follow me  zac all right  matt as you leap which at this point youre just past your face and nose under the sand you leap  onto and grabbing onto the sides of his head just as it passes his eyes as you grab it you now  plant your feet to pull what youre used to you know when you get /none/ a nice firm foothold and pull  theres no firm foothold your feet go into the sand and you just continue going underneath with  him until eventually you yourself are completely submerged and disappear beneath the surface of  this now leaving you alone staring at this now slowly stopping funnel of cascading sand  marisha oh shit what you gonna do  zac well fuck it im going to jump in after them oh this is stupid this is stupid stupid  stupid yeah im gonna jump in after them  matt all right you run and you /none/ leap and with an impact sound your tiefling self dips and  immediately disappears beneath the surface theres a few moments of very scary breathlessness  as all of a sudden suffocation hits each of you the darkness youre unable to see youre unable to  move and theres just this constraint of earth pressing around you and for a good five to ten  seconds you begin to come to terms with your mortality as if this is your  final moment on this plane  zac well this sucks so far  matt then you feel this strange /none/ lightening sensation in your feet almost like the pressures  beginning to alleviate and with that you now fall youre falling in darkness  ify and dan yell  dan god no im gonna die without seeing my helen again oh no  zac i use my darkvision to kind of see whats below me  ify wheres my money wheres my money  matt unfortunately theres no light source down here at all so you dont even have dim light to  work off of its pure darkness however i want you all to make an acrobatics check with /none/  disadvantage  dan how do i echolocate  matt so roll 2d20 and drop the highest  ify whoa what roll  liam roll twice and use the lowest one  zac oh well  dan rolled a two and a three  zac also two  dan i got an 11  matt okay  ify i rolled a  zac wait so what do i add that to  dan acrobatics thatd be plus one  zac laughs  ify i rolled a 17  matt 17  zac three  dan 11  matt three all /none/ right so you both impact on soft sand and in the immediate point of impact you just  instinctively have learning how to fall and tumble you manage to go with the momentum and  step out of the way of an impact minimizing the damage you each take actually you take two  points of damage you take one point of damage you however go facefirst into the top taking a  significant amount of impact to your spine your neck and your shoulders you take four points of  damage from the fall and are now head buried /none/ like an ostrich in the top of the sandpile with your  legs and arms dangling going like muffled yelling  zac muffled get me up get me up you son of a bitch get me outta the ground  dan oh i got sandburn on me bairn  ify oh my god that shit i know oh look here look at it lets not help him just look at it  zac muffled damn dwarves i hate dwarves  dan im gonna try and pull him out  matt its not very hard you yank him out at this /none/ point it is nearly pitchblack in this area you  can barely see a couple feet in front of you but you can hear immediately there is this distant  sound almost like the ringing of very very gentle bells it seems very out of place and perpetual  and the tone shifts and overlaps  ify yo yall hear that  dan yeah someones playing crystal bells  ify nah thats some money clinking right there  zac thats not i dont think thats money  ify you ever clink some money together and hear that clinkling sound money /none/ be clinking  zac no i think this is a great idea run straight towards it why dont you just see go  run right to it  ify nah  zac its probably money its probably money  ify last time we did something like that we ended up in a hole and your head was  upsidedown  dan that was a great moment i loved that  ify see its moments like this that make memories you know what im saying  dan im gonna see that when i go to sleep later  ify yeah  /none/ dan so the room were in its mostly sand does it seem like theres  matt you can only see a few feet in front of you  dan okay  matt anyone have a torch or any sort of light source  ify yeah i have a torch sings got a torch in my dungeoneers pack  laughter  dan i love your theme songs  matt you light up a torch as the light source breathes out into the room you can see theres a  large dome of sand that is slowly caved in from the top /none/ surface of this small cavein however  about 30 feet down it comes to rest in what looks like some sort of a slightly toppled stone  structure that has been breached on this side almost like there was something deep under the  ground that has crumbled inward and the sand has slowly poured into it also seems to be the source  of this strange ringing sound this faint ringing  dan id like to investigate the stone object and use stone cunning to go ahead and see if i can  find its origin  matt okay /none/  ify use that stone cunning  dan you know i know my stones  ify yeah yeah yo and i give him dwarven dap because thats some dwarven stuff right there  dan dap it up proper  ify thats that d shit right there  dan oh look at me im a halfling like get real  ify i know yeah  zac regardless of what you are you are quite useful in these situations  ify hey my man snuggle look at the rock you cant tell me shit cause youre not a dwarf  laughs you /none/ cant man you cant tell me shit about rocks  dan cause youve been burnt  zac oh yeah your hands looking really good right now  dan yeah like your selfconfidence now let me look at the stone  ify i know  matt laughs go ahead and roll an investigation check  dan 15 do i add anything for stone cunning  matt i would say ill give you advantage on the roll so you can roll a second time sure  dan okay all right im sticking with the 15  matt all right so as you /none/ step up to what looks like the little bit of this stone outcropping  thats slowly peering out of the earth it looks like this is the upper corner of a stone chamber  that has crumbled in a little bit and youre now peering into it from an elevated position outside  of the chamber looking at the structure of the stone the way its built and carved and wedged  together to form the almost bricklike pattern of its making its definitely not dwarven in make  but it looks very old and it looks like the material /none/ itself is almost like a sandstone and a  lot of civilizations that long existed before proper stonecutting could be used where stone  could be moved from nearby mountains or even the dwarven stonecutting techniques were spread across  this land this was a very primitive way of building subterranean structures you gather this  interior is probably very very old well over a thousand years and as you peer down into it using  the torchlight you can see down within the chamber its rectangular in shape there appears  to be a trough with some sort of /none/ liquid that is in an ovoid shape around a raised platform in the  center and in the center of this platform on top of it you can see a very very dull blue glow  from this crystalline spherical orb that is resting on it and is giving off this very very  faint blue light and the further you walk towards it as you inspect the interior from the top of the  hole in this stone structure you hear that musical ringing sound get louder and louder as you  step towards it  dan got you /none/ how big does the crystal look roughly in size shape and weight  matt id say roughly baseball size its about that big around its about 25 feet from you  currently  zac can i check the room for traps  matt youre welcome to if you want to step up to the corner  ify youd better do that quick because thats a bigass crystal  dan oh yeah  ify  and that looks like its worth a lot of money  dan i was just gonna say  ify yeah you know  zac i really /none/ wanna check for traps before this guy  dan and im a rogue  matt make a perception check  ify yo just hurry up and check it man cause im about to run in there  dan plus perception thats plus three yeah perception  zac okay 22  matt 22 as you step towards the edge of the corner you can see the sand that has spilled into  the room allows you a small decline to step into the room if youd like to as you get to the edge  of the sand you glance at /none/ the nearby panels and you can see there are small language runes that  are carved into portions of the floor many of which seem to be just situationally part of a  hieroglyphic storytelling aspect like the whole room but a language you dont understand what  languages do you guys speak  dan common and dwarven  ify yeah common and dwarven  zac i have no idea  matt were gonna say you dont know it cause it keeps mystery abound but you do notice that there  are a handful of runes across the floor primarily /none/ at the northsoutheastwesttype portions of the  stone flooring surrounding the crystal and where that small water trough surrounds it on the  outskirts of that water on those positions those four corners the runes are deepercarved into the  stone and seem to almost have a quartzlike texture to them almost like there was something  quartz set into the stone floor  zac hm hm totally clear you should run down in there and see what its all about yeah  dan sounds great ive got an idea does any of you have something similar to the size /none/ of that  there gem  zac thats a good i  ify yo  dan im gonna get a running start i am going to throw  ify you sound like youre taking ideas from some type of lore that may not exist on this plane and  it sounds like a dumbass idea  dan no no its gonna be great trust me  zac im pretty sure ive heard this tale many many years ago and i dont think it  works out too well  dan this is anything but derivative i dont know what youre /none/ talking about  zac youve read the tale too right  ify yeah yeah yeah  zac yeah there will be a giant boulder that will come rolling down towards your face i dont think  it will work  ify yo how about this rope test 20 okay so were gonna get a rope were gonna throw it on  the floor were gonna throw the rope on the floor and then if anything happens we know its a  trap if not im gonna get my new gem  zac as long as you throw the rope im /none/ okay with this plan  ify swerve all right im gonna throw some rope  dan laughs more classic slang love it  liam it works for anything scottish accent oh kitten masturbation classic dwarven slang  dan you have to see it to believe it sounds like these bells  marisha scottish accent vehicular manslaughter classic dwarf  matt all right so as you step down into the room you take a little bit of the rope you cut  if off with one of your swords you take it and you toss it towards one of the small /none/ quartzlike  runes on the ground it hits and comes to rest over the small central quartztype rune a few  moments pass no reaction then the room shudders for a second you feel the entire structure shake  with a sudden impact  zac well not good  matt a little bit of the sand comes down and settles to rest for a moment before you start  seeing certain blocks on the opposite sides of the room begin to glow  ify fuck  dan great  matt as they glow they begin to drift out of the /none/ walls almost suspended in the air and begin to  lock together in different places until eventually it forms a haphazard humanoid figure in  a matter of seconds  ify oh what is that damn whoa  dan oh wow  ify this is some like weird some like what  dan you took the words out of my mouth  ify oh damn  matt at which point this hulking humanoid form probably standing at close to eight and a half  nine feet tall made of these sandstone blocks thatve been pulled from the wall hands in /none/ place  unmoving the crystal on the side of the room flashes with a vibrant blue light as it does in  the center of this chamber where the eyes and the mouth of this humanoid would be a similar blue  light suddenly flicks on like its been given sudden sentience at which point this large  sandstone golemtype entity begins to charge towards you roll initiative  laughter  zac okay so what numbers this  matt so you roll a d20 and add your initiative modifier  dan roll and add initiative modifier its gonna be plus /none/ one  marisha we fought some golems before  zac thats all i add  dan yeah  matt all right so  dan 20  matt 20  zac 16  ify six  matt laughs nice  ify i like to call that the ringer baby  dan clean up  matt all right so were gonna say at the top of the round salty you got first up  dan oh great  matt youre still on the outskirts of the room now the only person whos really stepped in at  this point are the two /none/ of them youre kind of still in the back corner so you see it charging  more towards these two but you have the top of the round so  dan id like to slink off to the right draw my shortbow and try to shoot  an arrow at the crystal  matt okay cool so as you kind of slide down the sand decline you come around the edge pull out  your shortbow let it fly go ahead and roll for an attack  marisha sandecline eh sandy cline  liam hes showing his legitimate dd roots /none/  dan 11  matt 11 as you release the arrow the shuddering of each footstep of the golem itself is very  upsetting and in the chaos you let go of the arrow missing by a mere inch as it disappears  into the darkness  dan ah so close  matt you hear it richochet  ify you aint no elf man you aint no elf shooting arrows  dan i wake up every day ashamed  ify wheres your weapon  laughter  matt so that takes you to rest inside the chamber kind of off to /none/ the right of where the  rest of the party is next up we have snugglelord  zac okay so  matt its coming towards you  zac its running towards me really fast i look around me and i freak out and i go oh shit and  i cast that thauma  dan thaumaturgy  matt thaumaturgy  zac thaumaturgy and make myself appear to be a massive giantlike individual with a booming voice  and i intimidate him and go you are beneath me you foul creature  ify yeah make him punch you first  matt /dung/ so for a moment this frightened shaking tiefling individual grounds himself and this kind  of greenish energy begins to build around his body as it does his physical form seems to  almost rise two to three feet his shoulders broaden his face grows dark his eyes begin to  spark with a fiery red light the voice booms out throughout the hallway and the entirety of this  rooms structure catching you offguard go ahead and roll an intimidation check  marisha oh shit  zac oh fuck  dan laughs well it could be okay  zac /none/ eight  matt eight  zac yeah  marisha total  zac thats with a plus six  matt neither the speed gait or power of the golem seem to have slowed it continues to barrel  towards you  zac this was a bad idea you guys panicked yelling  ify you just made him bigger you just made him bigger man  dan oh no  zac go go go ill pay you more money i swear  ify ah thats the magic  zac all of my earnings from this like that dude that dad that bad /none/ father obviously ill  give you all of it just take care of this for me  matt as youre saying this the golem reaches forward before you finish your sentence and goes  to grab you whats your armor class  zac studded leather and 13 armor class  matt okay you take five points of crushing damage as the hand reaches crushes down on your  shoulders and body and lifts you off your feet you are now considered grappled  zac motherfucker this hurts this hurts get him off of me highpitched yelling  dan he picked /none/ him up he just grabbed him  zac do something you stupid dwarves do something  ify so if im swinging with two weapons do i roll twice  matt you do use your bonus action for a second attack you just dont add your strength modifier  to the second attack  ify so thats going to be 18  matt 18 okay and roll the second attack  ify all right oh and because i have the twoweapon fighter i still get to add the  strength modifier  matt oh you do awesome so you can do /none/ both nice  ify oh that one is going to be 12  matt 12 12 misses unfortunately but the first attack does ring true go ahead and roll damage  ify all right where are you mr eight you are not mr eight there it is i swing for plus  strength 11  matt 11 points of damage nice so after it grabs and picks up the tiefling you can see the fingers  actually crushing as hes screaming you pull the weapons out swing one that manages to pass under  its arm the second one goes /none/ straight into its torso and carves out a portion of the stone even  though the sandstone is a very hard surface you manage to find a portion between the bricks that  jammed together and actually carves a chunk of brick out of the side of its torso you can see  the structure kind of shifts a little bit on one side and now its kind of standing a little  offkilter but is still solid in its current physical form but well done you carved a  sizeable part out of it brings us  dan break /none/ it  zac im still being crushed you dumbass do something  ify got some extra money  matt top of the round salty  dan id like to reload my bow and take another shot  marisha reload that bow  matt go ahead and fire again  marisha dat bow though  zac is he trying the same thing i cant see anything theres a giant hand covering my face  dan you bet your ass 13  matt 13  dan mmhm  matt as you swing and release this does hit the crystal but at a /none/ certain angle that causes it to  just glance off  dan oh come on it hit the rim  matt it did it is a spherical object unfortunately it deflects coming piercing very  well that close but not quite enough to get to it  dan rats  matt do you want to move or are you gonna stay where you are  dan im going to yeah im gonna move back im gonna move closer by ten feet to the crystal  matt okay so you shift up youre now at the outskirts of that liquid thats /none/ surrounding it  dan yeah  matt okay its only about five feet wide so you can leap over it easily but you stop there that  ends your turn youre up snugs  zac okay can i use the hellish rebuke on him  matt you can  zac am i allowed to do that  matt you can thats the hellish rebuke as the ability here pull it up real fast because i  dont have any tieflings here we go hellish rebuke thats a reaction you can make in  response so you actually couldve done that /none/ as hes crushing you which well say you do right  now so as hes crushing you you do that as a reaction immediately you point your finger and  so as youre being crushed youre like ahh you point your finger at its arm  zac eee  dan the wet willy  matt as you awkwardly finger the sandstone golems brick structure it fails its saving throw  so it takes 2d10 fire damage  dan whats on that finger  matt go ahead and roll so tensider twice  zac tensider okay  marisha had some habanero /none/ sauce recently  dan yeah its a spicy fingerblast  zac two and four  matt two and four so six points of fire damage as your finger enters the portion between the  bricks theres a burst of flame and it looks like an impact of some sort of internal arcane  explosion causing the sutures between all the different bricks to shake for a second you see  dust and sand settle between the portions of its torso that are holding its limbs to it a pretty  sizeable impact from an unexpected position so that was your /none/ reaction now what do you wanna do  for your turn  zac okay great so the cantrips can be used  matt as many times as you want  zac  as many times as i want  ify yeah do some more of that fire stuff its working man  dan cast a spell itll be great do more of that finger stuff  zac im gonna use the poison spray on him  matt okay okay  zac see if that does anything  ify yo you trying to poison some magic stuff  dan sandstones greatest /none/ weakness poison  matt laughs all right so you bring your hand out towards the creature you release this sudden  burst of poisonous gas  zac im panicking assholes im freaking held up by the top of my head this is really excruciating  pain i may have made a poor decision i dont know im just doing something  matt as the cloud swarms around the entity it does not seem to be affected by the presence of  poison as its physical form does not fall under the category of a natural living entity however  you /none/ can use your movement to try and break free of the grapple  zac so i try to run away  matt okay so you try and break out go ahead and you can make either an athletics or an acrobatics  roll your choice  zac well  dan you should acrobatics laughs  zac acrobatics  matt all right go ahead and roll acrobatics  zac okay thats 12  matt 12 all right you manage to just squeeze out of its grip land on your feet and get back  about five feet its still right in /none/ front of you but youre no longer in its grasp  dan slippery bastard  matt okay so as its turn its going to do frenzied punches its gonna do an attack on both  of you just giant fists it clenches its fingers together into two giant hammers of sandstone  zac ah dammit no i cant take this kind of punishment youre supposed to take these  matt thats going to be a 16 against you  ify my armor class is 16  matt it just manages to impact so as one fist goes bang hitting you /none/ right in the breadbasket  you can feel the armor absorbs a lot of the blow but it still nearly knocks the wind out of you  dan not the basket  matt you take seven points of bludgeoning damage  ify god damn  matt from the sheer impact and force of the blow as it pulls its fist back  it backhands towards you  zac of course yeah it gives me the backhand  matt thats gonna be an eight whats your armor class  zac 13  matt 13 you duck beneath the arc and it /none/ swings wildly missing you entirely  ify all our lucks been wasted on you man that hurt  matt ulfgar its your turn now as you recover from the blow  zac you got this you got this  ify oh nobody punches me in the chest and lives to tell the tale so im gonna go ahead and  sliceanddice all right regina i swing for  dan his righthand sword  ify  21  matt 21 hits roll the second attack  zac you announce it his righthand sword  dan i just love color commentary  /none/ ify and linda and with linda i swing for 19  matt both hit go ahead and roll damage on both strikes  ify oh yeah laughs so um regina smacks for five  matt five damage  ify linda smacks for 11  matt nice so you bring both swings down simultaneously streaking an xmark strike across  its back as you do you carve a sizeable rock from the side of its back as the stones tumble  off of its torso and its shoulder area it hits the ground and they just turn to dust upon impact /none/  with the ground you can see now within the sandstone in the center there is kind of a  crackling arcane energy almost like a spiderlike electricity that is holding its form together that  is the same color as the stone in the center of the room do you want to move at all or are you  going to stay where you are  ify i think im gonna stay there and actually use an action surge to swing  at the innards of this beast  matt okay go ahead and roll another attack  marisha /none/ oh snap  dan like the magic school bus going inside  ify that is going to be 14  marisha i knew i shouldve stayed home today  matt 14 with this actionsurge strike you go and you bring your sword down as your sword gets  within a few inches of the back a bit of that blue energy arcs out and hits the blade causing  your hand to recoil instinctively you drop the weapon for a second from the sheer shock of it  realize what youve done and reach down and pick it up again /none/ it manages to knock your attack out  of use unfortunately  ify oh go for the crystal i think the blue stuff might work  dan yeah you think  matt that brings us up to the top salty youre up  dan all right  zac do it again i know i said it was stupid last time but go for it  dan im gonna believe in myself im gonna sprint towards the crystal leap through the air doing a  flip grabbing it and taking it out of its hold  ify is the flip just /none/ natural you just had to add the flip  matt all right  dan go for broke  matt go ahead and make an acrobatics roll  dan i got a one  laughter  dan this die is terrible this is hot garbage  marisha another die  matt you back up pushing off the back wall of the room you go into a ninja sprint leap through  the air over the moat of brackish liquid around the orb you reach out and realize youre about a  foot and a half too high you reach down for /none/ it pass through your fingers you tumble over and  land backfirst into the other side of the moat splash splashing liquid all over your back and  torso you tumble off slide across to the side of the room slam hitting the opposite side of the  wall on your back your feet assup assoverteakettle  dan never believe in yourself  laughter  matt you are considered prone and you take three points of acid damage from splashing  into the liquid  dan oh god  matt snugglelord youre up  marisha believing in yourself is a /none/ lie once again dd teaches real life lessons  zac its coming for me  dan i almost got it  zac i know man its a  dan are you casting a spell called friends  zac oh no i cant no i cant i cant do it because hes hostile towards me i cast fire into  the weak spot on the back to see if fire does anything to disrupt the energy thats inside it  matt what spell are you using for that  zac thauma  matt thaumaturgy  zac thaumaturgy  matt okay as /none/ you focus for a second you raise your hand up in the air using your demonic  heritage to call forth some infernal fire that bursts for a second in the center of where that  electricity is it sparks up and then is snuffed no seeming effect  zac am i allowed to move after that  matt you can move after that yeah  zac i move a couple steps back like whoa shit shit shit shit shit  matt okay so you carefully step away it takes a swing at you as you step out of its /none/ range that is  gonna be  dan attack of opportunity  matt  11 which i believe misses you  zac yes  matt so as you step out of the way it comes down with a giant fist hammerblow style as you  sidestep out of the way as it cracks some of the stone on the ground  zac can we all take a second to laugh at how great what salty just did was  because that was amazing  dan it was pretty great  matt ulfgar youre up  dan im in so much /none/ pain  ify all right am i close enough to the crystal to run towards it  matt you can youd probably take an attack from the creature but  ify all right yeah i run towards it safely not trying to do any fancy flips or anything  matt okay so as you rush past it swings out at you thats gonna be a 14 i think you said your  acs 16  ify yeah  matt so you just it glances off your shoulder you take the blow but keep pushing forward with  the sheer force /none/ of your dwarven physical self  ify woo  matt as you leap just over the liquid im just gonna make you have you do a  quick athletics roll  ify all right i rolled 24  matt 24  dan oh come on  matt you leap across threepoint landing  ify kobe  matt you stand up the orbs there in front of you you wanted to grab the orb you said you  wanna grab the orb you said  ify yes  matt okay you grab the orb you pull it off the pedestal make /none/ a constitution saving throw  dan laughs classic slang  laughter  ify i so constitution i roll a god damn 24  matt 24 as you clutch the orb you can feel for a moment the electrical energy surging through  your forearms and into your body and for a second your muscles tense and you feel like your physical  form is being slowed down but you shrug it off for a second as youre clutching it in your hands  right now youre looking at it youve pulled it off of the pedestal as you pull it /none/ off the  pedestal it leaves a couple trails of sparks off the top that stretch out between the pedestal and  where youre pulling the orb off you look back and the entity currently is looking like its  slowing in its physical ability to move around when its in your grasp but its still turning  around towards you kind of looking noticing that youve now grabbed something that is inherently  connected to its physicality  ify all right then i break it and say i own you  matt make an attack  laughter  dan /none/ great breath control  ify 14  matt 14 all right you take the orb you spike it on the ground and you see it crack upon the  impact it doesnt break but a big solid crack suddenly spiders through the entire interior of  the orb as it rolls off and into the liquid on the outskirts you can see the electrical center  in the center of the sandstone golem flicker and flash with light and you see one of its arms hits  the ground behind it and scatters into dust and sand its still keeping /none/ its form together and  its kind of lurching towards you with its other arm rearing back for some sort of an attack but  it looks like its having a really hard time holding itself together thats gonna end your  turn salty youre up  ify salty you gotta put your hand in the juice again you gotta put your hand in that juice get  that orb  dan you cant be serious  marisha believe believe salty  dan no it never works  ify just put your hand in the juice  dan im going /none/ to so if im not mistaken i can expend a hit die to regain some health  is that true  matt you can during a rest not in the middle of combat unfortunately  ify laughs you got this baby  dan all right ive got i think i have three hit points left maybe five or three somewhere i  think im at five so sorry the orb is in  matt its currently he slammed it into the ground it cracked and it rolled into the moat on  the to you it would be on the /none/ right side of the building right now  dan oh come on all right im going to take my cape wrap it around my arm and just run and  scoop it  matt okay so you use half your movement to get up and you rush towards you can get just to the  outside of it cause you can see a little bit of the blue interior you reach down inside you pull  it up i want you to go ahead and make a constitution saving throw  ify you got this salty  dan not using /none/ that die again  zac i kind of believe in you  dan oh you shouldnt have done that thatll be a seven  marisha oh no salty  matt so as you pick up the orb you grab it triumphantly in your hand you can see the liquid  its not touching your skin for once however there is a surge of electrical energy into your  body and as you grasp it you can feel the muscles in your arm and shoulder and back all tense up  you find yourself held in place unable to move  /none/ dan guys little help  matt that ends your turn that brings us to snugglelord what you got  zac shit  ify its the orb break that orb man its the orb  zac i pull out my crossbow  ify oh no no anything but that  dan i always knew it would end like this thats what the gypsy woman said  matt you have other spells  zac not really i picked terrible spells for this  matt your firstlevel spells you have three you should have  liam wait whats your melee weapon  orion /none/ eldritch blast eldritch blast  zac i have a handaxe  matt do you

liam smash it  zac okay im gonna smash it im gonna run up and smash it in his hand  dan please no  ify dont worry dont worry salty ill drink to your name  zac im honestly not worried about /none/ his hand hes already lost a lot of use of it the skin is gone  like hell be it doesnt matter youre not gonna masturbate with that thing anyway anymore  dan i never did  matt so snugglelords tiefling form darts in and in the shaded interior of the room runs across go  ahead and just make an acrobatics check real fast as you cross the moat  liam oh sever his wanking hand classic dwarven move  dan classic tiefling betrayal  zac okay all right 19  matt 19 you leap over without an issue /none/ you actually tumble and roll on the ground as you  come up you use the inertia to swing your axe in a wide arc down towards his hand roll an attack  ify ill drink to your name man cause youre about to be dead  zac okay what do i add on these  dan 15 you beat a 14 armor class you hit  liam dan casey still in character holding up the orb  matt okay so go ahead and roll damage for the axe  dan oh this is gonna suck  zac what do /none/ i do for damage dice  ify 1d6  matt 1d6 and add your strength modifier to it  zac well thats nothing  ify zero  zac one  liam no  orion thats for the attack  matt ones all you needed  marisha ones all he needed  matt the crystal is already heavily damaged you bring the axe down  dan ah god  matt it shatters the crystal into a hundred pieces across the room i want you to go ahead and  roll another damage attack on his hand  dan fucking great  /none/ marisha how many hit points did you have left  dan five on a good day three more realistically  zac low roll low roll low roll  ify five  zac five  laughter  dan thats a whammy  matt so as the crystal shatters you can see the golem form which is coming up behind you with a  giant pistonlike hand suddenly just vanishes into dust and sparks as it scatters across the  ground the axe swings through and youre extremely excited at the impact as you look up and  see what is a /none/ fingerless halfhand now bleeding profusely  zac haha you look better now  dan oh everybodys a fucking comedian  matt which is the last words you say before you fall unconscious on the ground from the severe  shock and blood loss  zac we did it  ify aw man i really liked that dude man  zac hes fine he just lost some fingers  matt so as hes now unconscious on the ground bleeding out does anyone wanna try and help him  ify yeah im gonna try and resurrect him in some way  matt /none/ all right go ahead and make a medicine check do you have a medicine kit or anything like that  zac i dont have one  orion yes say yes thaumaturgy  ify i just have the dungeoneers kit  matt all right make a medicine check  dan cauterize the wound  marisha are you trying to say stop the bleeding with thaumaturgy is that what  youre trying to say  dan yeah cauterize my stump  marisha by screaming at it  liam he could stick a dagger into the end of that hell be fine  /none/ zac or that spicy fingerblast  ify i rolled 17 for medicine  matt 17 okay well say between the two of you working together to bring out some material you  rip off part of a cloth you had stored in your bag you use thaumaturgy to go ahead and cauterize  the wound eventually you stop the bleeding you wrap it up you wait a few moments and he comes to  slow consciousness sore worse for wear but alive nevertheless  zac you did good  ify hey man  dan i beat the golem i did /none/ it  zac you did all of it it was all you  dan im going to cough blood  matt and he does  ify just want to get you guys invoiced that gem that you guys destroyed was probably worth like  500 gold so yall both are in debt  zac youre still getting paid youre still getting paid  dan classic dwarven accounting  zac well just go back to the bad father hell give you your money  ify yeah yeah you totally gave up your share so its between me and salty  zac /none/ i remember that  matt you do notice as youre on the ground looking around suddenly the brackish liquid  thats surrounded it seems to have lost a lot of its darker viscous aspect and now its kind of  clear smooth pure water  dan i am gonna plunge my mangled paw into that clearass water  matt it is cold and slightly helpful in soothing the pain and you are glad for once since you  arrived here to see some water that is not absolutely terrifying  dan thank god for that  ify yeah man we /none/ did it  dan its good its good  ify so do you want me to pick up your fingers or  dan yeah thatd be fucking great  ify all right so i put his fingers in my pack  dan im a little shorthanded  matt go ahead and make a perception check  marisha fingerscouting mission  liam one two where are the other three  ify perception ten  matt you find two fingers god knows where the rest are buried either somewhere in the remains of  the sand creature or somewhere else in the /none/ room but after a good five minutes of scouting you  manage to find two of the digits  liam he can still rock on though  orion thats all you need  dan its all i have surfs up  matt as you guys slowly find your way back up to the top of the pile of sand that led you into this  chamber you look up and you can see theres a small bit of light and you hear a voice echoing  through going hello hello  zac yeah we are down here and all the /town/ trouble seems to be gone  matt youre alive  zac yeah well  dan you could say that  zac were kind of okay  matt okay hold on and eventually over a few minutes you see a small rope being let down  ify oh thats what i like to see  matt one by one they pull you up  zac you know i do like those ropes  matt one by one they pull you back up through the surface you find yourselves at the center of the  town and everyones gathered around with what /none/ seems to be a slightly more positive demeanor to  them as you guys all get up there lily runs up and gives you all an immediate hug and says  thank you i felt it lift i felt the darkness in my mind disappear whatever you did it worked  youve lifted the curse  zac please please please dont shower us with all of your riches and food and foul women  ify this guys delirious were fighting on gold  zac if you must if you must throw all of those things at us as some sort /none/ of reward for the good  deed we have just done that would be wonderful and great  matt all of them kind of look at each other and you can see there are a few people now stepped out  of the tents some of them almost lepers in the way that theyre bandaged just going uh and the  old woman goes we havent much in the way of food but weve pooled our resources and she  looks to the halfling male apparently the father figure to lily who says a promise is a  promise and /none/ he reaches back and he pulls out a pouch you can see its hefty full of coins and  looks to who to plop it to immediately  ify its over here he gave it away in the battle  zac hes

the same way i feel your pain  liam classic tale of childhood innovation  dan thats so sad  orion thats gonna have to be integrated  somehow  zac all i hope is that the fans of critical role got some enjoyment out of that and that we get  even an inkling of the fanart that you guys get when you /dung/ do your show  matt oh im sure  liam please please something  marisha i really wanna see salty pete with his cape  zac yeah we didnt really get a good description of what you look like  ify oh basically you know i look like a dark iron orc which is like a grayish stone skin ive  got a kimbo slice beard going on  dan hell yes  ify i have an iron chain around my neck at all times over my chainmail and i got a stein with  brass knuckles as the handle /none/  laughter  ify and i always wear my gold sack just out  dan flaunt it  ify so people know how much money im rocking with  zac i basically look exactly like a tiefling wearing a unicorn onesie for no apparent reason  whatsoever i did cut a nice little tailslot out the back though  matt good that wasnt confusing at all for the horse youve been riding this whole time  zac well that horse has seen better days now  matt yeah  marisha what do you look like salty pete  dan well /none/ salty pete strikes an imposing figure he cuts a mean swath basically hes wearing a  battered leather jerkin some rich woolen pants to get him through those salty nights on the open  seas he also has a velvet doublet because youve gotta treat yourself right every now and then and  of course hes never seen without his signature black cape which was once upon a time the flag  flying high above the masts on the obsidian helen the ship that he lusted after he also has a  grizzled gray beard not kimbo sliceesque more like /tavern/ ser davos seaworthean in stature and size  marisha nice  matt fantastic  zac we basically look like the most hilarious gay bar troupe you could ever see  laughter  zac straight out of central san francisco  matt i would party so hard with you guys  zac ive got these two on metal chains  dan well im a polar bear  marisha laughs metal chains ive seen that at anime conventions  matt get on it artists  zac im pretty sure in west hollywood ive seen somebody walking down the street  in this /none/ exact getup  marisha im pretty sure i have so heres my question cause was this your first time playing  dd too dan  dan no  liam no hell no you can tell  marisha but this was your first time  zac ive never done this this was great  marisha did you feel like it was intimidating the roleplaying aspect of it at first and how  did you feel any awkwardness easing into it  zac well we are on the internet in front of a lot of people that are silently judging me there /tavern/  is that small factor also theres usually the people sitting here that are fucking  professionals so there is a slight bar thats really really high like a little intimidation  there the roleplaying parts really fun what im intimidated by is just this is a lot of stuff  this is a lot of information and its a lot to learn im excited to learn and i want to know  what all this stuff is because i dont want to feel like a dumdum and i feel kinda like a  dumdum but this is great this /none/ is so much fun but yeah a little intimidated by how vast the  knowledge is thats incorporated into this  matt yeah its a lot to throw you at once you did really good with what was thrown at you  taliesin it does start to feel smaller it does eventually start to feel its like learning how  to juggle youre like ahh and then suddenly its like okay  dan once you learn the basic math its basically just applying that to every situation and once  you get that down its just a matter of getting /none/ into the minutiae and thats something that took me  a while cause math was not my strong suit  zac oh no  dan unless its the number one which ill roll all day everyday  zac yeah you were throwing number ones man  dan i thought it was golf no once you learn that basic system its really cool because you  can extrapolate from that and apply it to every situation  zac nah  ify what  dan i mean thats literally how it works  zac i was gonna say we could elaborate on /none/ ifys dd experiences but id prefer to not travel down  that trail  ify nah ive been in a few groups im currently in a ucb group and i usually tend to play im  the guy who starts the fights all the time  matt i had a feeling  zac hector was in your group and you guys killed him off right  ify that was actually dale it wasnt darren hes our only cleric and the one fight the dm  told me that like the fight initiated monster went for hector critical hit dead one /none/ shot at  the beginning of the encounter  dan brutal brutal  ify and so the guys that i play with decided because hector missed a few so well just  resurrect him when he comes back and so we were playing last sunday and i was like oh what  about hector and he goes yeah how long until we have to resurrect him he goes oh its about ten  days and i was like how long has it been hes like in the game its been about a month so his  corpse is rotting  /none/ matt shouldve put that in my icalendar oh well  marisha oh we missed that resurrection appointment reschedule  zac can i take one small moment to say i saw we were at 3170 subs 30 more well do another  giveaway of a book and a picture it will take us a little bit to get the books though guys  because im pretty sure you guys had something to do with this but in the last two weeks all the  dd handbooks on amazon have been out of stock and they werent a month ago we keep /none/ trying to  add them to our wishlist to get more and theyre just out of stock so were working on getting  some more so we can do them for giveaways and stuff but when we get to 3200 well give away  some more so sub if you can it supports all of us  matt thank you guys so much for watching any last comments you want to make before we sign  off  zac thank you coaches  liam i would love it if what was your name again  dan who me  liam /none/ no the group the group  matt dan and ify the good the rad and the nubbly  liam the good the bad and the nubbly  zac the good the rad and the nubbly  liam the good the rad and the nubbly could come back somehow and intersect with us  dan a multiverse  zac if we cross your path run away just run the fuck away all right  marisha oh shit its the good the rad and the nubbly run run theyre the fuckups of emon  zac youll see us coming from a hill /town/ a long way away the guy on the horse with the two dwarves on  chains and leather behind him  marisha youre just that adventuring party where whenever you roll into town were just like  sighs heavily  taliesin its like the blue beetle and booster gold of the critical role  dan classic skates  taliesin thank you thank you  orion and id like to say to everybody whos watching that had those questions about how do you  roleplay how do you have fun you just saw three dudes with different levels of experience having /none/  all an amazing time and we loved every second of watching it so  taliesin doing something totally different than what we do  orion no game has to be the same you play it how you want and thats a good time  marisha i actually had someone tweeting at me being like you know talking about us mentioning  how you shouldnt be intimidated by roleplaying they said yes but conversely not everyones an  actor and i just want to address that like roleplaying has nothing to do with acting  zac i am not an /none/ actor not an actor  marisha roleplaying isnt about acting its about playing pretend its about makebelieve  with emphasis on playing so just play its not about coming up with a character and a motivation  and any of that its just about playing  orion or that money  marisha or that money  ify its about the damn money baby  zac sometimes motivations are easy to come  by just tap that different part of yourself  ify throw them gold pieces on the table throw them gold pieces on the table  zac theres a /none/ character inside each of you guys just tap into that inner ify and just put it out  on the table  marisha as sarcastic as zac is being its totally true  orion its true it is  marisha its totally true like if you guys notice they made their characters while matt was  talking about dming and then they had fully fleshedout characters by the time they started  playing and mainly thats because they just had a few solid ideas and then their characters built  as the story unfolded and that was great that was /none/ awesome  matt and like i said earlier if you are still intimidated dont worry you dont have to come  out of the gate being completely open to it just find your way in play as comfortable as you are  and work towards getting to that point where youre able to talk as that character and just  notify the rest of the party and your dm that youre working on it and let them be respectful  and eventually youll find your way comfortable to talk like it if thats what you want some games  just /none/ wanna be you know diablostyle dungeoncrawlers kill shit get loot and thats  totally fine too  marisha and seriously if anyone judges you because of your roleplaying fuck them they  shouldnt be in your game anymore  dan sneak attack they wont expect it  zac sneaky pete em  matt 5d6  zac sneaky pete em right in the face  liam just be willing to be stupid because thats half the fun  dan friendly fire is on  ify im a big proponent of friendly fire  dan oh zac do you like friendly fire /none/  ify basically quick story last sunday in our group we kidnapped a guy cause we were  questioning him and he just never was intimidated by me because early in the game i tried to bluff  check to try and get him to give me 200 gold for no reason and rolled a one and so we had him  and so dead strongjaw is a barbarian huge barbarian like i rolled hot that night i had 21  strength so i tried to punch him to knock him out cause he started screaming for help we ran /dung/  inside his apartment and i broke his jaw and we dragged him into a nearby cave and  marisha where is this going  ify  so the whole time  dan that man was kanye west through the wire  ify so through that our we had this warlock or wizard who summoned this infernal mastiff to ride  and he was talking all this shit so i rolled and punched his mastiff and since it was a spell i  punched it out of existence and thats when the archivist came to and he was like he /none/ just sees  me punch it and i kept saying we are good people because i realized that im neutral good so i  didnt want to torture him and then thats when the dm was like just so you know he came to you  punched a devilish mastiff out of existence and yelled were good people  over and over to him  matt thats a way to get it across thats the kind of shit that happens yeah well guys thank  you so much for watching i hope its been semiinformative at the very least fun /none/ to watch  well definitely be up next week for the continuation of the critical role storyline  picking up where kvarn was defeated in the depths of the temple of yugvoril the
