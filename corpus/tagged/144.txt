town	 matt hello and welcome to this evenings episode of critical role well be with you in just a  second unfortunately were down a travis willingham tonight but in grogs stead we have  the rest of the party venturing forth into the emberhold after just recently discovering lady kima we shall see  what happens very shortly but in the meantime lets go ahead and  give you guys some character backstory  dramatic music  ashley pike grew up on the outskirts of town near the bramblewood her ancestors were a family  of deep gnomes with quite 
none	 an unfavorable reputation thievery destruction and trickery  left them with the curse of the last name trickfoot sarenrae the goddess of healing and  redemption had other plans for pikes greatgreatgrandfather wilhand who left his  family at a young age after a dream a dream that changed the course of the trickfoot family  wilhand devoted his life to sarenrae and pledged from then on that him and his family would live a  life of service and devotion as a child pike seemed to have an affinity to heal whether it was  animals people or even 
none	 flowers she felt she had a purpose in making things whole that had once  been broken she studied and learned the ways to heal through divine magic she lived a peaceful  life quiet and simple until one day wilhand was captured and almost killed by a group of goliath  barbarians one of the goliaths took a stand against the murder of the innocent gnome and he  himself was beaten bloodied and left for dead abandoned by his herd wilhand went to pike for  help she prayed and healed this barbarian as best she could bringing 
none	 him back to life when he  awoke she discovered his name was grog strongjaw after that they were the best of friends a  rather unlikely pair little did she know that in a few years time grog would soon return the favor  and bring her back from the clutches of death roaring crunch after being killed in battle  pike felt angry she wanted to be stronger so that it would never happen again she spent four months  at sea training with the men and women aboard a ship called the broken howl gripping her holy 
none	  symbol in one hand and her morningstar in the other this time pike is ready  travis right listen up if you have ale then you have a friend in grog strongjaw a goliath of  towering height and size this barbarian has an appetite for the two great loves in his life  combat women and ale wait easily the brains of the group grog is often consulted for his vast  knowledge of shapes colors and shiny things also ale in his early years armed with his  twohanded great axe grog often enjoyed proving his might 
none	 amongst the ranks of his familys  wandering herd but after coming upon an unsuspecting elderly gnome in the woods he  objected to the killing of such an innocent life a creature of impulse grog felt only pity for  this terrified little thing his disobedience cost him dearly beaten bloody and banished by the herd  leader his uncle kevdak grog was abandoned and left to die exiled from his herd it was then  that the relative of the very gnome he fought to save saved him it was the kindness of a gnome  cleric named 
none	 pike that healed grog bringing him back from deaths edge and they have remained  close friends ever since most nights grog can be found challenging entire taverns to wrestling  matches or accompanying scanlan to the nearest house where you pay for lady favors also ale  marisha a first impression of keyleth would leave you with little information on the halfelven  druid you might even think that her social awkwardness due to her sheltered upbringing is  kind of sweet of course it would be unwise to underestimate her based on first impressions  under that unintimidating 
none	 petite frame is a vicious beast waiting to be unleashed whose  natural powers have made even the fiercest of champions pee their pants literally laughs  born to the air tribe of the ashari people keyleth was raised with a deep love of nature and  the elemental magics it is her peoples inherent duty to protect the delicate areas in taldorei  where the four elemental planes begin to bleed with this realm since she was a little girl she  had quite a knack for air manipulation and beastshaping abilities well if you consider  kittens and 
none	 flying squirrels to be little beasts which i do anyways it wasnt long before the  headmaster of the tribe her father korren realized her true prodigious abilities and she was  inveterated to succeed him as the next headmaster just like that her jovial childhood was stripped  and replaced with endless spell memorization teachings from ancient traditions and exceedingly  high expectations every druid leader to be must embark on a journey to seek out the sister tribes  in order to introduce and establish respect amongst the fellow headmasters they call this the  aramente or noble 
none	 odyssey when her father felt she was ready he set her on the path to truly  discovering herself not knowing when or if she will ever return as she hiked down the mountain  towards stillben she meditated on the task ahead part of the aramente is proving yourself a strong  warrior a valiant protector and a wise and compassionate leader with this knowledge one  thought plays in repeat in her mind is she even worthy  taliesin percy was the third of seven children born to a noble family who lived far to  the north 
dung	 in the ancient castle of whitestone with so many siblings to share the burdens of  lordship percy turned his attentions to the sciences engineering and naturalism one day a  mysterious couple named lord and lady briarwood came to court during a feast held in their honor  the briarwoods violently took control of the castle killing or imprisoning everyone who would  stand in their way percy awoke chained in the dungeon only to be freed by his younger sister  together they fled chased by the briarwoods men as they ran percys sister took several arrows to 
none	  the chest and fell percy kept running eventually jumping into a freezing river and floating  unconscious to freedom he did not remember waking up on a fishing boat he barely remembered the  next two years as he slowly made his way as far south as possible then one night percy had a  dream a roaring cloud of smoke offered him vengeance against those who destroyed his family  when he awoke percy began to design his first gun gunshot  sam oh you havent heard of scanlan shorthalt well gird your loins ladies because he has 
none	 his  eye on you a talented musician master of disguise and dashingly handsome in his own mind  scanlan sings songs almost as much as he sings his own praises born a poor gnome scanlan used his  endless charm and soaring tenor voice to croon for coin and support his single mother one day he was  discovered by a halforc promoter and joined dr dranzels spectacular traveling troupe where he  learned the ways of the world and honed his skills as a bard extraordinaire a loner much of  his life scanlan has never quite come 
town	 to terms with the violent death of his mother at the hands  of a goblin invasion while his years on the road provided many shall we say educational  experiences with the opposite sex deep down scanlan yearns for the one thing hes never known  the true love of a fellow gnome still scanlan considers himself a lover first performer second  and fighter distant third on the battlefield hell support his allies but rarely draws blood  unless its to protect fellow gnome pike count on scanlan for a hearty laugh a rollicking song  and a 
town	 twinkle in his eye that melts hearts and makes the females swoon  orion greetings and salutations i am tiberius stormwind i hail from a town called tyrex  located in the heart of draconia born from a politically respected family at the age of 15 i  succeeded in passing the sorcerers rite showing prodigylike control of my magic the judges and  the draconian high council were amazed at how powerful my spells were for how long i had been  training at 20 years old i was the youngest appointed member of the magic guild in draconian 
none	  history for the next few years i almost went mad from the malaise of being a guild member as its  rather boring however one day i happened upon a chamber unused for quite some time in the room  were stacks of books and maps of the surrounding cities and areas around the known world for  months i would frequent the chamber and learned of artifacts from legend after a long period of  research i made a list of artifacts that caught my eye i brought these findings to the high  council and was told 
town	 that all of the information in the chamber i had stumbled upon was either  believed to be fiction or unsolvable mysteries and hence were lost forever i found those answers  to be unacceptable a year later i devised a ruse and managed to convince the city council to lend  support in me leaving draconia on a mission of peace and diplomacy for the surrounding kingdoms  going from town to town and making friends and allies in and for the name of draconia being a  red dragonborn i had quite the task on my hands in 
none	 that respect but it was exactly what i needed  so i could explore the world and find these artifacts as i felt the truth was out there some  may describe me as buffoonish but i say poppycock to all that i am much sharper than most give me  credit for i just dont pay attention to things sometimes ive also been known to be rather  cunning loyal happygolucky and well dangerous i cant help but show my true scales  every now and then but overall i think im quite friendly for a dragonborn  liam 
none	 never entirely welcome in the company of elves or men vaxildan learned at a young age to  skip past formality preferring instead to invite himself in your door along with twin sister  vexahlia vax was born by a chance encounter between elven royalty and human peasantry raised  by their mother in their early years the twins were eventually sent off to their father in the  elven capital of syngorn but their cool reception among the elves there never warmed and their time  in the capital didnt last the siblings stole away one autumn night and 
town	 set out on the open  road after a few years of wandering they eventually decided to return to their mother and  journeyed back to the lands of their youth but instead of finding their childhood home they  returned to a pile of rubble their mother was gone their home burned to ash pressing the  townspeople for answers they learned of the day the dragon came with their ties all severed  vaxildan and his sister set out to find their fortune together in taldorei an outsider since  birth vax quickly learned to solve lifes challenges 
none	 in his own particular way often by  sidestepping them entirely and when his knack for circumventing adversity isnt enough the way of  blades the elves schooled him in more than makes up the difference  laura like so many halfelves vexahlia has spent most of her life suffering the cool  reception of a people who dont fully accept her born of a human mother and an elven father who  only later in life took an interest in their existence vexahlia and her twin brother  vaxildan quickly realized the only people they could truly rely on 
none	 in this world were each other  it was at the age of ten when the two were taken from their mother and brought to live in syngorn  the isolated elven city for which their father was an ambassador he quietly took them in but always  kept an icy distance and after too many years of disdainful looks the pair decided to leave his  indifference behind and set out on their own vax took to the cities stealing small trinkets and  learning the ways of the thief while vex kept to the woods she preferred the 
none	 isolation always the  keen observer she learned to hunt and to track to spy and to shoot and through a series of  fateful events earned herself a companion in the form of a bear her own stolen trinket to fight  alongside her and protect her fiercely also he is adorable and gives expert massages  dramatic music  matt hello everyone and welcome back to the next episode of critical role we unfortunately are  down one grog this evening as i mentioned before  all distressed noises  matt we are missing him terribly well see

town	 indeed so fantastic i may have some more stuff down the road well be able to talk about  but in the meantime lets go ahead and get everyone caught up to speed with what has transpired  recently on critical role so the party to give you a quick overview for those who have just  joined us they were given a mission to seek out a female halfling paladin named lady kima of vord  who had been missing going on a vision quest apparently seeking some deep dark evil that had  begun to simmer and grow 
none	 beneath the dwarven city of kraghammer the party managed to make their way  to the city delve deep within its caverns to discover an entire series of caves and what  eventually led to the underdark itself a subterranean landscape of terror and darkness  after a series of battles with some duergar which are kinda ashyskinned evil dwarven offshoot  people characters and a few brushes with some illithids or mind flayer creatures they managed  to befriend one or i should say ally with one named clarota who has been traveling with them  who has apparently 
none	 been kicked away from his society and wishes reentry to save them from the  kind of ominous presence of this unseen barely spoken entity called kvorn kvarn  laughter  matt long day long day so upon traveling deep into the recesses  sam dont worry matt you just have to talk for three straight hours  matt laughs i know i know  laughter  marisha your day is just getting started  matt i know but yes so they have now after a series of battles found their way into the  magmacovered kind of obsidian jagged 
none	 caverns where the emberhold the duergar fortress  currently resides where they believe lady kima was upon finding a way in unfortunately  announcing their presence to the fortress itself they managed to find lady kima in a torture  chamber beneath emberhold save her slay her oppressor and now they have after a tenuous  alliance was made as lady kima and their mindflayer friend clarota are very much at odds  a very tenuous alliance was forged and they now journey back up to the main basement floor or  main base floor of the emberhold proper and 
none	 thats where we left off last time so hope you  can absorb all that guys laughs  sam we are inside this fortress  matt correct  sam we are moving towards the armory were trying to find the armory or something  is that right  matt youre trying to find essentially lady kima has mentioned she wants to find the rest of  her equipment that she says is either in an armory or she mentioned a vault and also she  knows she mentioned something about vengeance to those who run the keep so she stormed 
none	 up  laura were following her right  matt youve followed her back into the base floor of the emberhold itself you all currently are now  back kinda where you started after you snuck into the side passage of the emberhold  laura and she said she would lead the way to the vault  sam can we be quiet for a second and see if theres any footsteps around us or guards marching  around are we in immediate peril or do we have a second  matt certainly everyone go ahead and make an immediate perception roll 
none	  sam okay  laura so fast  marisha website went live if you want to announce that now or later  matt later two  laura no 22 laughs  liam 28  ashley 13  taliesin 24  orion fail  sam ten laughs  matt thats a fail all right so youve got to be ready  marisha 27  matt okay  laughter  sam im sure hell give you half of that  matt nearly at the ready all right so as you all take a moment and kind of steel yourselves  your ears 
none	 perk up and you can hear what sounds like echoes of distant footsteps down hallways  far out of sight you hear some movement across the stone ceiling above you that eventually comes  to a stop and you wait for about a minute and the entire place is now in a very eerie silence  liam they know were here still  laura but they dont know where we are  liam no  orion maybe they went to sleep  taliesin lady kima do you remember where the vault is  do you remember how we can get 
none	 back there  matt kima turns to you her eyes still peering back and shes creeping towards the edge of the  hallway she looks back at you briefly and says ive only seen half of this stronghold before  they captured me as far as i know probably somewhere on the second floor  laura what floor are we on now  matt the ground floor  liam the ground floor  laura right cool  ashley so its just one up  laughter  matt apparently  liam were there stairs when we went down that set of 
none	 stairs there was there also stairs going  up right there or stairs going up  matt there were stairs right there no there were stairs going up  in the first room you entered  laura oh right so we could go back in the little storage room  liam we could  laura and go up  liam we should just spend the next three hours in the storage room  laura lets go in the storage room and go up  liam lady kima allow me to take a peek around the corner see whats going on 
none	  so im gonna go stealth  matt okay go ahead and roll stealth  liam and inch past her thats good 29  matt 29 all right she begrudgingly steps back you can see theres that eagerness to get in some  sort of a fray or to feel somebody else bash along the side of this greatsword that she borrowed from  you guys she lets you pass you creep up along the edge as you do you see back here there is  in the middle of this hallway a series of doorways and what looks to 
dung	 be a large room in the  center of the chamber where two duergar currently stand  liam i turn back to the group  taliesin whispers how about the other way  sam why dont we just kill them  liam isnt that a corner a deadon corner right there  matt this is another hallway  liam another hallway  sam lets go kill the duergar  laura how dark is it in here is it like  matt no its pretty dark in here like with low light vision youre able to see maybe a good 30 
dung	  to 40 feet ahead of you there are a few of those red crystal clusters that give off a little bit of  light incrementally but duergar themselves youve gotten to the point where you see they like  it very very dark they actually arent needing light this is more of a courtesy to guests they  may have  laura so potentially brother we could take them both out if you throw your knife  and i do an arrow  orion wait didnt we see further past that cause thats where grog did the  crushing 
none	 noise  sam no this is the area that we havent been in yet  liam i just put up a hand and then slip around this direction and slip down this second hallway  that you revealed  matt all right as you step past you do see this room here is a little ajar the inside looks  to be a storage room theres just a series of boxes barrels and various  laura gasps maybe you can put yourself in a box and walk around  marisha gasps yes metal gear solid it  liam i continue 
none	 to creep away from my sister specifically  matt all right you glare down the side of this hallway it leads to two other smaller rooms down  the way with a split towards the back end there does not appear to be anybody  visible in that hall  liam all right i got this im going to keep going  sam wait what about us  laura why are you doing this  matt all right so you go past this way  sam jesus two duergar we can take them out in a second  matt now

none	 peek in  matt perception roll  liam 20  matt 20 you take a moment and listen you hear what sounds like a light crackling of some sort of  a fire and the occasional dull ring of metal being hit against metal  sam what was it metal against metal  liam okay im going to get low to the ground and peek in the door  matt all right peeking through you do see indeed it is some sort of a smithy with two  kilns or two anvils set up a work table in the center 
none	 and there is one lone duergar that  apparently in the middle of his work has not been paying attention to any of the ruckus going  on around and is just in the middle of hitting some sort of long thick piece of black iron and  its just ting ting sweat dripping down the front of his brow the room itself is even  against the corner of the doorway you can tell the temperature is a lot warmer on the inside  liam and his back is to me currently  matt its kinda to the side 
none	 to you hes currently looking working out  the anvil banging down  liam so this way  matt yes  liam oh but i see the door on the other side so i take the earring  sam oh why dont you just keep going forever  liam  take the earring and i whisper to my sister whispers follow along  laura oh ive been invited on the field trip guys  sam just you  laura just me  sam come on  laura who else can stealth  marisha im a stealthy panther right now

none	 your heads simultaneously say  i can also accompany  ashley good plan good plan clarota  sam all right ill step ahead and go invisible  matt all right so mark off your next invisibility spell as you vanish clarota also  kind of waves his hand for a moment and his image disappears the same way scanlans did  sam ooh he does that too  matt apparently  laura what did he do  sam he went invisible sings were walking down a hall nobodys watching us  laughter  matt as youre humming to yourself  
none	 sam oh no  matt you make your way down and eventually towards the back of where  vax is pressed against the  liam i can feel scanlans flute pressing into my buttocks  sam thats not my flute  laughter  liam so i turn to them and then i start i pass the door  matt okay  liam im gonna go around the corner to that other door  matt all right  liam and now im going to stab the duergar in the neck  matt all right go ahead and roll for an attack

none	 petting all right so that duergars down the current armory  section appears to be completely open and at your disposal there are a series of partially made  weapons kind of scattered in a pile there are some ingots and even some raw iron material in  the far corner other than that it just looks like your general smithing workshop  sam is kima with us now  matt kima is currently looking around this section with you guys  sam kima do you see any of your equipment here that you wanted  matt she glances around 
none	 goes and move some of the piles by turning over the room as quietly as she  can not as quietly as youd like but quiet enough no nothings here  sam cant you just take one of these things and call it a day  laughter  matt she glares in the direction of your voice  sam im invisible i  matt this will do me just fine for now  sam oh  matt right lets keep looking she leaves the room she starts heading down this way  liam all right im following after her tiptoeing

none	 you can see kima is now  moving across  sam aw shes just going  laura go listen aw shes still going that direction  liam all right im tiptoejogging behind kima  marisha can we do something to slow her down  sam i can stop her if you want  marisha well i mean can we i mean we dont wanna stop her  i just wanna be like hey slow girl  laura shes you know what i bet shes pretty noisy too  matt shes wearing leather armor shes not very noisy right now  
none	 liam i carefully place a hand on kimas shoulder and do a little sort of curtsy motion  allow me i can  matt okay as you do so she kinda stops and looks back over her shoulder and gives a begrudging nod  but you can see shes theres shaking her hand holding the greatsword  is currently shaking with rage  liam i say silent two words three syllables  laughter  matt all right so coasting down this hallway it leads down to an open doorway and a closed  doorway immediately to your right and then 
none	 the room to actually the doorways to your left  and to the right you see another wall to another room that you dont have  a doorway currently available  liam theres a door to my left and a door straight ahead right  matt correct  liam okay i inch up to the closed door on the left and place my ear to the door and listen  matt okay go ahead and make a perception check  liam yeah natural 20  marisha what  ashley come on  sam yeah its gonna be one of those 
none	 nights  laura i need that one oh my goodness  taliesin dont jinx it  matt im gon kill all you  laura no  laughter  matt you put your ear to the side and you hear nothing  liam okay do i sense any kind of im checking for traps on the door  matt okay yup  liam traps perception right 26  matt so the door itself does not appear to be trapped it does appear to be locked though  liam all right well i pull out my picks and i get a three 
none	 on that so  matt thats okay its a really really really crappy lock  laura oh  matt you notice that the door itself it has a locking mechanism on it it was kinda halflocked  and as you push it opens up into a commode  liam aw yes  matt theres nobody in there it is a room with what looks almost like a bench with a series of  holes cut into the bench its a communal  liam well im tempted to close the door for a moment but i will press on instead  
none	 sam check for loot  laughter  laura gross  liam all right so im going to inch towards that open door ahead of me see whats around the  corner  sam im gonna follow im gonna inch up behind him as well im still invisible right how long  does that last  matt okay its concentration for quite some time i believe  marisha actually  taliesin really quickly oh do you want to go first  marisha no you go  taliesin does anyone want to hide these bodies that weve just scattered about  laura 
none	 yeah that would be good  marisha inside the loo  taliesin its a perfect place for them to be interred  liam so pike hold still please  ashley im not moving  sam pike eviscerate the bodies  marisha here im gonna ill walk over in tiger form and i just grab one by the scruff and  start dragging it  matt grog helps out you guys move the two bodies slowly over into the restroom area  marisha wait we kinda prop them up to kinda like weekend at bernies them yeah make them just  
tavern	 look like theyre you know passed out  matt okay as theyre both generally laying back like they just got really drunk and barely found  their way to the toilet  sam and throats slit  laughter  matt its really rough blockage  marisha we take that one and kind of like lean him forward so you cant tell immediately  matt okay all right thats not a worry you bring that up to that little area there  all right  liam well done there  taliesin oh thank you  matt you guys move forward to 
tavern	 that grog has come over here to be able to help now looking down  this hallway here you can see  sam who we got who we got  matt this side opens up  laura all i want to do is find the damn treasure room  matt looking into this room it appears to be a barracks a room that is just filled with  different beds all apparently empty  laura oh theyre up and looking for us  marisha apparently empty  matt from what you can see  marisha can i use my keen 
none	 smell to see if i smell any duergar in there  matt sure so you slowly approach the door using your keen senses which opens up this  hallway a little bit visibly to you you can see it goes back quite a bit sniffing this room you  can tell that there were duergar there recently apparently at the moment though there is no  immediate scent that matches a duergar so the room for the most part has been completely  evacuated  marisha okay i kinda even though im not a dog im a cat i still 
none	 kinda point i go into  pointer face you know like  orion pointer face  marisha you know like a pointer  liam yeah angling your nose forward all right  sam i think keyleth has to pee  laughter  sam i never had a cat  liam all right im gonna start sliding down that hall there ignoring this other passage and get  up to the door and again place my ear to it oh look theres the front entrance  matt as you look to your right this is a large foyertype area with two 
none	 red carpets that are  rolled on the sides of it that lead to the front of the main doublesided large tenfoottall  stone doors of the front of the fortress to your left there is a double wooden door about eight  feet tall each side about five feet wide that are currently closed leading into whatever this  large chamber is immediately to your left  sam can i hang a right and go down that other hall  taliesin we should check out whats in that other hall  sam is there a door over there  
none	 matt there are two doors actually  sam closed  matt both closed  sam im going to listen into those doors  matt make a perception check  sam natural 17  cheering  marisha gotta love that nat 17  matt listening in you dont hear any noise  sam that could mean nothing  liam are you at the double doors with me  sam im to the right i went the other way  liam okay im going to listen at the big wooden doors and i rolled oh  not that great 17  matt 
none	 all right listening in  orion i scootch up ahead of grog like excuse me excuse me  matt as you listen back there is no noise internally except for the slight squeak as you  put yourself against the door it shifts a little bit making no noticeable noise but it appears the  doors are unlocked or there is no lock  laura oh no  matt youre not hearing anything from inside that one door youre at  sam wait i just heard a noise  matt no you hear no noise coming from that room  
none	 sam oh okay stinking cloud can i go through doors or do i have to see what  im casting it at  matt you have to have sight unfortunately i mean you could peek very low  sam im going to open the door and look  matt okay  sam cause why not  matt you open the door it appears to be some sort of a guest bedroom its a singular bed  thats in much better condition than the barracks its empty its wellmade its more lit than the  other rooms it seems to be 
none	 a room thats designed for either nonduergar riffraff or general  soldiers or guests or people that would come to the fortress to stay so  sam okay  liam im going to try to peer into the door and i havent talked about this before but im wearing  a cloak of elvenkind which means i have advantage on stealth and enemies have disadvantage on  spotting me so im going to lean my head in  matt all right  liam do i need to roll for stealth or am i already stealthed  matt for this youre 
none	 already stealthed so as you glance inside the room you see what appears  to be a great hall of some kind there are large wooden tables there is a fire pit in the center  that has a number of mostly burned wood that is mainly just small darkened embers with a little  bit of glowing yellow and red to it there are stools scattered about the room you can see there  are remnants of some of a meal that hasnt been fully cleaned up yet on some of the tables but  the room appears to 
none	 be empty you do see a slight glimmer across the way on one of the tables  liam oh im going to go check it out  laura whispers get the sparkly thing  matt all right everyone else what are you doing  sam can i look around the guest bedroom just kinda snoop around up in things  laura can i ask him im asking you what you see in there what do you see in there  liam i dont know yet hold on  laura is it sparkly  liam im going to try to sense 
none	 for traps in this room  matt okay  marisha im going to snoop in the barracks  matt snoop in the barracks  liam 14  orion im going to make my way around all this riffraff uh no uh yes  matt you push your way through excuse me excuse me pardon me pushing through everybody  orion im going to go past where vax is in the room down that hallway then im going to do my  mage hand thingy again oh my prestidigitation  matt down this hallway  orion mmhm  matt okay  
none	 orion slowly five feet by five feet  matt all right you see slowly as you move down this hallway to check it out a secondary set of  barracks that are also apparently empty  laura where are they the stairs are up in the storage room man thats where we just were  matt you see a secondary commode that is open and as you glance around the corner as the light  passes by you see there are two duergar currently coming down the hallway this direction  marisha oh shit  orion i just stop and 
none	 i creep back  matt okay as you creep back you hear footsteps coming your way quickly  liam im going to the door then i can hear that inside the door inside the door  matt oh inside the door there  marisha im going to stay actually right there just right at the threshold  matt okay the rest of you guys  laura i mean im so far away i can try to get up there but  matt you can glance theres still a hallway around that way if you wanted to go around  laura 
none	 okay ill go around the back way then  matt okay so you move around  laura with trinket  matt trinket follows up behind makes your way up there scanlan you staying in that room  sam im taking a dump on the guest bed  laughter  orion they dont see me right  laura i like walk by the door and see that happening  laughter  sam but also just covering it up with a blanket afterwards  matt okay well youre in midprocess this is all happening very quickly  sam oh grunts  ashley 
none	 ill go around back behind where trinket and vex just went  matt okay because of your little legs you get about that far your little legs carry you  sam im invisible its poop  laughter  matt sighs  grunting and laughter  marisha its apparating poo  taliesin im staying in the hallway  sam scanlans just like i hate this mission  matt okay so tiberius as youre backing up both the duergar turn around immediately seeing  you and rear back with javelins throwing them directly at you  orion oh ill cast blur instead 
none	  matt okay go ahead and roll initiative real fast to see who gets off first what  orion im not going to count that oh ill count that 19  laughter  matt what why didnt you count it  orion because it flew out of my hand i didnt roll it  matt okay all right  orion yeah  laughter  orion its on camera tell them to play back  matt so you go ahead and cast blur you guys see as tiberius comes running back startled sounds  he manages to cast a spell really 
none	 fast as two javelins come flying towards him his visible  image begins to actually blur the outline looks almost like theres two mirror images of tiberius  in the same place that are both shimmering and preventing them from actually telling where hes  actually standing the first javelin comes in at a 14  orion nope  matt second one comes in at a 17  orion 17 yes  matt oh sorry no its a four cause it has disadvantage so both javelins just whish past  looks like they pierced part of that kinda shimmering blurring 
dung	 form but both just ricochet  off the walls of stone and come clattering to the ground kinda near back where kima and grog are  they both step out of the way as they land  marisha haha  matt all right so that brings us to that was your action who else wants  to take the next action  liam im gonna hold  laura i cant see anything can i from where i am  matt its kinda dark and you can see movement in the distance  laura can i hop on trinkets back and 
none	 see if i can see higher  matt you can try all right so you hop on the back of trinket laughs looking over the top  and you know grog is kinda blocking part of your view but you can see with your lowlight vision  what looks to be tiberius form shimmering and two duergarheight individuals that are partially  blocked by him so they do have partial cover or threequarters cover do you have the feat that  ignores that  laura i dont know i dont know  matt laughs because you dont know im going 
dung	 to say no  taliesin it would be called sharpshooter  matt yeah it would be called sharpshooter is the feat  laura no i dont have that  matt okay yeah so go ahead and roll for attack on one or both duergar up to you  laura 21  matt okay  laura and 23  matt okay the 21 misses the 23 hits because they have cover and because its so dark its  difficult to make out their form but you do manage to hit one with the arrow  laura okay i hunters mark him 
none	  matt okay next time make sure you do that before you attack otherwise it wont count for  the attack  laura okay okay 13 uh 12 laughs math stay in school  matt laughs all right there you go 12 then add your hunters mark bonus to that as well  laura oh good one  matt all right gotcha so one arrow sinks in the shoulder but doesnt appear to be stopping his  angry advance towards tiberius lets see youre staying where you are  liam waiting  matt all right you guys are actually kind 
none	 of like pinched off in the hallway right here so as  you guys are all kind of  sam strained dont say pinched off to me  laughter  matt  as youre doing this tiberius youre right there the two duergar catch up to you and  both now that their javelins are out of their hands pull out their hammers with their bonus  actions and come down at you with an attack each  marisha run tiberius  matt thats gonna be a six  orion no  matt and a 17  orion 17 hits 
none	  matt okay yeah that blur is saving you man all right so as the one both the duergar are  kinda like swelling with frustration anger its an ability youve now gotten to the point where  you can see these duergar can actually temporarily increase their form for stronger blows  and attacks comes and strikes you for 12 points of bludgeoning damage as the hammer comes cracking  down finding purchase on your torso and it kinda pushes you back a few inches thats gonna bruise  tomorrow morning  marisha can i do a combo move 
none	 with grog assuming that he would agree with me that its gonna be  super cool  matt hed probably agree with you what do you wanna do  marisha okay laughs thanks grog so since grogs kind of there can we arrange like a  fastball special almost so have him like kind of go up and crouch and im gonna bust out  matt how are you going to communicate this to grog  marisha he with  liam meows  laughter  matt im gonna have to say unfortunately thats not gonna work out for this moment 
none	 grogs  attention is on the duergar and you are a giant cat  liam hey im gonna sneak behind tiberius and stab that guy  laura it wouldve been so cool though  ashley that wouldve been really cool  liam and since tiberius is there i can get sneak attack damage cause one of my allies is there  matt all right just a second there youre still holding lets finish keyleth so keyleth what  are you doing  marisha well is grog in my way  matt grog is there you can attempt to leap over 
none	 grog  marisha i was wanting to vault off grogs back is what i was wanting to do  matt you can do that without asking him  marisha yeah thats what i was going to do  matt no you were saying you wanted to tell grog you were going to do that but yes you can still  do it so go ahead and roll an acrobatics check  marisha no you asked how i was communicating it  laura just do it keyleth  marisha so im gonna come out and im gonna vault off his back 
none	 and try and do a pounce over top of  tiberius for that duergar thats closest to you what am i rolling  taliesin acrobatics  marisha acrobatics is this an acrobatics thing  matt yes from around the corner you pull back leap up jump onto grogs back and attempt to  spring off of it  marisha 11  matt 11 okay laughs all right so you jump off of grogs back grog not expecting it  instinctively ducks down and the force you push off as hes not aware theres going to be a giant  cat 
none	 there  marisha uhhuh  matt  in doing so it doesnt give you the momentum you need you are able to jump over him  and get kind of into center of the fray but you do not have the pounce attack unfortunately  marisha okay thats fine  matt but it gets you there at least  marisha oh can i not attack  matt you can attack yeah  marisha okay okay okay im gonna go ahead and do my bite attack  matt go for it  marisha im gonna go right for his throat still 
none	 with the same intention that i had in mind  matt okay this is the one that took the arrow from laura  marisha okay 17  matt 17 that hits go ahead and roll for damage  marisha 1d10 plus five wheres my d10s ten damage piercing damage  matt ten piercing damage all right so as you rush forward you bite at him you see he pulls  back but you get a big meaty chunk of his forearm and clamp down and you feel a snap some  sort of bone in the middle of his arm 
none	 and he gives out a horrible yells sound as he takes the  butt of his hammer and hits you on the snout doesnt do any damage but its enough to get you  to kind of let go of your grip a little bit and he rips his arm out of your jaws leaving that  kind of nasty irony taste of duergar blood that youve now become accustomed to unfortunately  that ends the round now you have tiberius and a cat in your way  marisha meows  liam do the doors go in or out that 
none	 im by  matt the doors go in  liam in so im just gonna go like this hinges creak and throw a dagger and say peekaboo at  the same time  laughter  matt okay as you step out fwip  liam that is a 29 to hit  matt that does hit  liam okay  matt you do not get sneak attack bonus unfortunately  liam even though my ally is five feet away from him i thought i remembered that rule  matt you do if you are in melee with them  laura oh 
none	 right  matt you get the bonus if youre both like flanking them or youre like harrying them in  combat because youre at a distance you dont get the bonus  liam okay so that is a nine and then im going to follow the nine of damage  matt all right  liam and immediately follow up with my other dagger which also hits  matt all right go ahead and roll damage on the second dagger which is 1d4 plus what  liam six thats a nine  matt nine okay so after the guy rips his 
dung	 arm out of keyleths face essentially a dagger comes  swinging out from behind the doorway stabs him in the other shoulder you see he looks down at it  confused for a second and as that dagger vanishes in a puff of dark smoke returning to your the  side of your hilt he looks up just in time to see the second dagger catch him right in the middle of  the forehead and he just falls onto his back at that point unmoving that duergar is stripped  laura whatwhat  matt whos up next who wants 
none	 to do anything who hasnt done anything yet this action  sam is there is a door next to me for another room  matt youre just finishing  sam oh im just finishing okay  matt sorry so pike have you done anything yet  ashley can i is there a door there somewhere right there  matt you move around here there is a door over here yes  ashley i cant really do anything check it out check it out  liam yeah bust in you cant stealth  matt the door is a secondary guest room 
none	  liam and now poop on this bed  ashley all right  laughter  taliesin i cant do anything that could make noise anyway  matt it is a guest room of equal design and dressing as the one that scanlan you are unaware  is currently fouling  laughter  ashley maybe i get a sudden urge for some reason to just poo on the bed  laughter  matt you can do what you want be aware pike as a character has her intent the more you stray  from that the more it will have ramifications 
none	 for her in the end  ashley yes i know im just kidding thats not what thats not what i want to do i was just  had this feeling that scanlan was doing something and i felt that  sam she could probably hear muffled from behind the door grunts  ashley okay so ill just i guess i cant do anything while im in there so can i just  matt thats about as far as youre able to move you can still use your action if you wanted to do  anything but right now your vision 
none	 is currently fairly wellblocked by a woman and a bear and a  man the size of a bear  ashley yeah okay so ill just hang out there  matt okay so that brings us back to kima who currently doesnt have any sort of way of getting  over there kind of frustrating trying  to find a way over  marisha its a narrow hallway  matt clarota who is still invisible is just gonna hold on that point  orion as everybody is doing this im going to why are you blocking me im not supposed 
none	 to be  this close to this thing keep going  matt okay percy stand there all right tiberius youre up  orion oh like i was saying well shit  sam arent you right next to the guy kill him  matt do it quick or we are gonna move for the next turn  orion okay ill just lift up my hand and go firebolt  matt okay pointblank firebolt go ahead and roll your spell attack  orion okay okay 20  matt 20 all right thatll hit go ahead and roll for damage for the firebolt 
none	  orion okay ten 18 20 21 23  matt 23 damage all right so as you instinctively pull back you release the blast of  firebolt energy the duergar who is currently harrying you with this warhammer takes the brunt  of it right to the bottom of his face and his torso the studded leather armor that hes wearing  tears open with a sheer flaming burst of the impact of it and you see most of his skin is  charred and burned at that point he reels back for a second looking very very hurt but 
none	 not quite put  down yet  orion as my bonus action im gonna spend two sorcery points and do it again so i roll for  that its a 22  matt all right the second blast as he reaches back before he can get a chance to get back to  his feet the second blast hits this time it sends him off his feet flying about five to ten feet  back skidding across the ground  orion 15 damage  matt yes and that puts him still on the floor laid out with a burning kind 
none	 of crippling crispy  scent in the air of what was once a standing duergar now dead and burning on the ground  marisha so once again i grab him by the scruff take him and put him in the bathroom  liam i give a couple of pats on tiberiuss shoulder and start to inch down the hall  matt all right as you guys are doing this scanlan steps out of the guest room getting his  pantaloons back on  sam my invisible pantaloons  matt yes you hear the footprints of scanlan you being still invisible 
none	 you essentially just  sam i phantom pooped did i find anything in there by the way  liam just relief  matt you found a fun way to prank duergar  marisha oh yeah did i find anything in the barracks  matt over there no  taliesin did liam did vax find anything shiny in the room the shiny thing  liam no i got interrupted thats a good idea thanks for the reminder percy  taliesin youre welcome yes  liam checking for i checked for traps before but i cant remember what i rolled im  
none	 sure it was successful  matt go ahead and roll again  laughter  liam 17  matt okay as you push the door open and get a glance inside of the main hall you dont see any  traps across the floor  liam okay im gonna go check out the shiny thing  matt okay everyone else staying out in the hallway  sam im coming with him  matt okay  sam if i can get there  matt you manage to scoot through dancing around folks people kind of let you get by  anyone else 
none	  laura yeah sure i like shiny things  marisha im burying my shame again burying the duergar  matt so youre dragging the duergar over in the  taliesin ill go in too  ashley ill follow ill follow  laura were all going its a big happy room  liam so say we all  marisha well i guess ill go after i bury duergar  matt yes as you guys step in here move up towards the back corner where theres the shiny  glint tiberius you stay inside or outside  orion im going to wait 
none	 for everybody to go inside  marisha we will be team outside posse  matt kima walks in grog goes to start making his way in as he does you go over towards the  glimmer the glimmer on the table you look its just formless and kind of this weird spark of  light it then vanishes and the doors that you guys entered  laura singsong its a trap  matt  slam behind you with tiberius grog and keyleth all kept outside of the room  ashley no  matt the rest of you guys the flames 
none	 go to darkness and the entire room goes pitchblack  marisha oh shit  laura oh no we dont have light  liam in the darkness i say fuck  laughter  laura stupid stupid stupid  orion i motion to grog and im like you know what to do damn it  matt grogs gonna go for the door however at this point in time im going to ask for  laura can we stealth i mean i guess were all kind of  sam ask for  liam roll for deus ex machina  sam oh youre gonna 
none	 ask the chat room something  matt no no no im not im working out whats actually gonna happen here all right  so suddenly there is a cacophonous bit of pain streaking through pike vex and clarota guys go  ahead and make an intelligence saving throw  sam intelligence  laura all of us  sam some sort of a mind thing  laura oh crud  marisha intelligence  laura oh oh oh oh no i dont get any advantage in this  liam 13  matt not you just you two so whats the  taliesin 
none	 never mind that was such a good roll  ashley what was that thats a one laughs  matt okay  ashley i rolled a one  matt so in the darkness suddenly there is this searing pain like some sort of screaming sound is  blasting you from the inside of your very mind you two are both currently stunned  laura oh crud  sam whos you two  laura me and pike  ashley i did bad things i did bad things i shouldnt have killed a man while he was down  wait so what does 
none	 that that means we just cant do anything right  matt on every turn you get to try and break that but right now neither of you can  marisha every turn they have to try and break out of it it keeps going  its like a keepgoing thing  matt you both just sit there grasping your heads just screaming in pain as your body is  unable to function or listen to any thought process clarota also unfortunately falls victim  to this and is also unable to make any actions  sam oh boy  liam 
none	 im pulling out my flametongue dagger to try to get a little bit of light in here  matt all right however you as you are currently pulling out your flametongue dagger you  feel a presence nearby and with a little bit of embers around the fire you see out of nothing a  figure step into view that apparently was not visible but a moment before a tall lithe figure  with long limbs fingers and a wrapping of facial tentacles coming towards your face  sam it was invisible  liam i see him im gonna stab 
none	 im just gonna stab  matt before you get the chance to stab you get a surprise attack from this guy  laura oh no what if he sucks our brains out  matt all right that comes to an 18 versus armor class  liam yeah he got me  matt so as you go back for your blade to pull it out he grabs you by the shoulders and pulls you  and the tentacles wrap around your face and pull you into this horrible toothy maw you feel this  tearing pain sensation as its teeth begin 
none	 to dig into your face  ashley no no no no  laura oh my god hes gonna die  liam that hurts a lot  matt you take 17 points of psychic damage as the actual presence of the tentacles pulling on your  face you feel its kind of grabbing your brain and trying to hold it in place you are currently  considered grappled  marisha son of a bitch  matt now guys everyone roll initiative that was a surprise round  marisha surprise round  matt yes  marisha cause they got the drop on 
none	 us  taliesin thatll do  orion whats going on in there i hear lots of ruckus  sam well be out in a minute  orion dont give me that scanlan oh scanlan you can hear me whats going on in there  sam were all dying  orion i turn to grog theyre all dying  matt laughs all right so 25 to 20  sam no one  matt all right 25 to 20 no one almost forgot go ahead and make an intelligence saving throw  liam 23  matt 23 all right you feel the 
none	 presence of its mind pressing into your brain and you manage to  through the pain of its tentacles pulling you towards its mouth shrug off its current attempt  to push into your mind  liam im thinking of the middle finger  matt thats a good thing okay so youre still grappled but youre not stunned  sam is he a piece on the board yet  matt both of them are now visible right there all right so 25 to 20  laura nobody  matt 20 to 15  liam 17  taliesin 16  orion 
dung	 17  matt 17 and 16 all right so actually grog is going first all right and percy 15 to ten ten  to five  marisha oh oh wait 13  laughter  marisha sorry i was thinking about shit  matt thats okay ten to five  laura nine  taliesin thinking about shit  marisha thinking about life and death laughs  taliesin word  matt all right  sam two  ashley oh so did i best friends  sam besties twinsies  ashley gnomesies  laughter  sam were still mr dungeon master sir this 
none	 is all the same day  i dont get any of my spells back  matt no you guys have not rested all right so first the top actually kima is at the top of  the initiative order  marisha kima get it girl get it get it girl  matt kima angrily leaps on top of the table and goes running down with an angry yell and leaps  down toward the one thats currently grabbing onto you with its grapple as shes running a little  bit of light bursts as you can see this divine energy 
none	 begin to burst and glow off the edge of the  greatsword that shes holding she leaps down and with a giant arc through the air that lights  up that portion of the room with a brief sweep the blade comes down towards oh thatll hit  second attack also hits  ashley yes go kima  matt so that comes to okay using her divine smite ability on top of that she manages to deal  37 points of damage to it  taliesin damn  matt as she finishes both of her strikes simultaneously the mindflayer however 
none	 does not  release its grasp on you you are still considered grappled that ends her turn grog now is gonna  angrily attempt to bash into this door is gonna make an actually no no athletics check hes  going to go into a rage and hitting away at the door  growling  liam and laura grog voice i would like to rage  laughter  matt all right that puts a total of 32 points of damage thats enough so grog just takes two big  swings the first one comes through cracks the door in half 
none	 splitting it down the center rears  back a second time cleaves through the door entirely what little bit is left on the hinges  he kicks out with his foot leaving now this side completely open to the interior he then moves in  around clarota thats as far as he can get in this current turn that brings us to vax  liam what can i do while grappled nothing until im ungrappled  matt well no you can try and make an acrobatics or athletics roll against them  to try and break free  liam okay

none	  can see as it rears back a spray of darkcolored liquid kind of warms the side of your face as you  pull the blade back out it rears back and growls you can hear its voice piercing into  your head going i will eat you one way or another  ashley no you wont  laura did it distract him enough that we lost our thingy  matt thats your main attack  liam i mean i would imagine between ungrappling and stabbing is that it for me or do i get my  second attack i

dung	 do you hear this blast burst of angry scream  inside your head before it goes dead cold silent and the mind flayer falls to the ground  liam i fucking hate these things  matt all right that brings us to clarota whos currently stunned and fails save clarotas still  stunned tiberius  orion i look through the door  matt look through the door  orion whats going on in here are there any enemies i can see  matt you can see over here barely its very dark in the far corner you can see just

none	 like theres just very little light in there currently  orion i will waltz in behind grog  matt all right  orion i cast light  matt okay the room all of a sudden bursts into view you can now see the walls the ceiling  its a smooth stone room there is a large chandelier currently hanging from the top of the  ceiling its about 25 feet up to the ceiling in this current room  marisha gasps theres a big chandelier thats fun  orion and now do i see that guy better  matt you 
none	 do yes you see now there is a mind flayer currently ducking behind one of the tables  right now you can see a number of your friends in the party are currently clutching their heads  silently screaming to themselves unmoving  orion ah right theres another one of those guys over there  marisha wait theres another one  orion yes  marisha theres two  matt theres two  orion i spend three sorcerer points  matt how many sorcerer points do you have left you spent a lot over the past couple games  orion no

none	 all the way up and smash that little bastard  matt all right  marisha smashy smashy  matt so whats the save you get past that for the spell  orion he does a dex save and he takes 6d6 damage and the dex save is to see if hes pinned  or not  matt right it does make its save i believe its 21  orion oh my what  matt rolled a 21 versus your dc of your spell which i believe is not higher than 21  orion no  matt so yeah so he 
none	 still takes the damage but is not pinned  orion which is 15 18 points of damage  matt okay 18 points of damage and manages to pull out of the way just in time as it slams into  him he darts off and catches himself on the ground kind of slowly levitating above the ground  as he comes to a stop the pillar then slams into the roof this section here actually splinters  part of the table which is now kind of lifted offkilter at an angle yup it  orion oh so that does that 
none	 mean hes in the air for a whole round cause how it works is  hes all the way up to that height but he gets to come or fall back down if he makes the save  thats how so he has to travel that distance so does he cast levitate as hes coming down  matt how im playing it is the impact of the pillar suddenly slamming in from underneath is  what does the initial damage and he manages to roll off before it slams into the ceiling he  kinda so however that ends your 
none	 turn the mind flayer now looking around and seeing the room lit  up seeing the entire group now in this room looks around at everyone puts its hands together  and concentrates and as it does you see its form sucking noise vanish  marisha damn it  matt a few seconds pass you guys manage to shrug your stun and clarota as well  ashley whoa what happened  marisha thats not good  laura what happened  marisha they really know were here  laura we need to get out of this room then  taliesin lets 
none	 just search the rest of this floor as quickly as possible  marisha as quickly as possible  laura grog can you always put down the dust of tracelessness  matt all right i will hes doing his flowergirl moment passes behind you guys all  right so what is the current mode of action for you guys  marisha im going to go ahead and dart down this hall that we know is for sure empty  matt okay  liam exit the other side of the great hall that were in  matt all right  laura and 
none	 i think we should all go back we should go to the second floor  matt through here  liam walking in that door  matt you look through here and see what appears to be some sort of a kitchen you can see shelf  units you can see what looks like a few tables you can see some kitchen elements  liam im gonna walk all the way in all the way in  matt all right you walk all the way in theres a door towards the back  liam the right what do i see  
none	 matt the right you see what looks to be a doorway thats partially open that leads to a  staircase  liam up or down  matt looks like its going up  marisha and whats in this room im looking over here  matt okay you look over here its a double door that is currently closed  taliesin i will head in your direction as well  orion eight two of my d6s to heal up  matt you havent taken a short rest yet you have to you guys have to stop and take ten minutes  
none	 15 minutes to rest to do that so  sam im gonna look all over the great hall and see if theres any cool stuff in there  matt make a perception check  laura i think what we should do everyone i think what we should do is make our way back to  the initial storage room we were in and go up that stairway because that ones hidden its by a  hidden entrance people arent gonna think about that one as much as main stairways  taliesin i agree i think we should i agree with 
none	 that i just think we should check the rest  of the floor as well just doublecheck everything make sure we didnt miss the  liam vax is heading back to the group  matt okay  marisha percy and i are checking this room with the double doors do you have any trap checks to  see if its locked  liam i do  matt okay so percy and both you guys open this doorway it opens up into what looks to be another  smaller eating hall this ones nicer this one has one long table this 
none	 is probably where the  more socially risen  taliesin take a quick look around  marisha yeah anything in there  matt looks like it hasnt been used for a day or two  taliesin all right  marisha no cool goodies  matt no current goodies in this area no  taliesin so well go just keep going down and check the rest of that hallway  matt okay  laura theres a lot more you guys i think we should go find the vault on the second floor  matt all right you guys press down here 
none	 there apparently are now you can see theres another  set of double doors  liam vax is following  matt all right  laura i think i should gather the group and try to make it back to the other storage room just to  get us out of this area specifically  matt so you guys are all moving back with  laura is that cool  matt  vex to return to the previous storage room  marisha we can do that yeah go for it  taliesin and youll hear us if anything goes wrong yeah 
none	 well power through it  laura use your earring  matt all right  marisha ill go ahead and very im just gonna kinda use my keen sense or sorry my keen smell  again to see if i can smell any duergar in the area  matt okay go ahead and make a perception check with advantage  marisha thats pretty good oh yeah ill take that first roll which was seven 27  matt 27 you smell that on this floor there doesnt appear to be any duergar in your immediate  vicinity there is a strong lingering 
none	 scent of them coming from the doorway  that youre currently at  marisha a strong lingering scent  matt correct like it you can kind of tell there was a recent moving of a large number of  duergar  marisha but probably not present  matt you dont know  marisha whatever i guess well see whats in here  matt all righty  marisha peeky peeky  liam i kind of parkour past percy  matt okay  orion parkour past percy  marisha parkour parkour  matt you open the doors into what appears to be 
none	 a large temple chamber a place of worship what you  see are a series of long wooden benches that are arranged to look towards the center there is an  altar to the right that is a risen kind of stone dais and in the center there is a stone table an  altar which has a piece of black cloth wrapped over it and something on top of it you cant see  from this distance in the center of the room there is a 12foottall statue of what looks like  an extremely strong armored duergar clutching 
none	 a giant warhammer and a shield  marisha hm im gonna oh wait im a tiger  matt yup  liam im gonna perception check the room which is high 27  matt 27 there does not appear to be anybody inside this room  liam screw this room  matt however do you have a religion  taliesin i would like to do a religion roll  matt roll religion guys  taliesin nine  liam nine  ashley could i do a religion roll from where i am  matt you are not over there unfortunately  marisha 
none	 thats what i was gonna do is tell somebody to get pike over here real quick  laura do you guys have earrings  ashley i can put on my sprinters boots  liam yeah pike pike theres some sort of religious artifacts over here could use your  expertise  matt pike you make your way through eventually coming down this hallway  clanking  marisha shes coming i can hear her coming  ashley hey guys im here did you know i was coming  laughter  matt go ahead and make a religion check  liam dont 
none	 stab anything  orion im gonna follow suit but slowly  ashley 17  matt all right as youre heading that direction slowly best that you can tell right now this  room is definitely a small temple built to and the name kind of escapes you the words trying to  form in your head for a second and then eventually you come to realize this is a chapel to  laduguer laduguer is the deity of the duergar its the god that basically freed them from their  original enslavement from the illithids and they worship as a 
none	 pinnacle of power  strength and conquest  orion i make it up to where those guys are  matt all right  taliesin lets keep searching  sam hey whats the darkness right next to me is there a door there what is that  matt there is a door right over here  sam oh im gonna open it  matt okay all right so you go ahead and open the door it opens up into what you can  immediately see is a chamber that is some kind of magical laboratory you see in the far corner 
none	  hunched a robed duergar and as you open the door theres a slight sound a click sound and a  jet of greenish fume begins to spray up into your face make a constitution save  sam oh god i dont even know what that is laughs 15  matt 15 all right  so you take 11 points of poison damage however you can feel the poison forcing its way  into your lungs you manage to back out of the cloud in time and cough it up and your general  physical wellbeing you resist most of 
none	 the effects of the poison however this poison fume  trap did appear to go off and as the smoke slowly dissipates you hear a chuckle  across the other side  orion as i hear the noise i  matt you dont hear the noise youre too far away  orion oh shit  matt you guys do hear it though  laura okay i come over there and see what the what just happened  matt okay as you rush over scanlans backed up away and you can see theres this chamber here  laura is the poison 
none	 still in the air or is it  matt its dissipated at this point its thin enough you still can smell it and it smells  awful like a very very heavy electrical firetype smell  laura so i can see that guy  matt yeah  laura so should i notch an arrow and try to hit him  matt its up to you whatre you going to do  laura all right i attack him then  matt all right go for it then  ashley attack him get him  laura shabang oh dang it i didnt 
none	 do it i meant to hunters mark him and transfer it over  but thats okay i didnt say it  matt you didnt say it this time  laura thats 30 for the first  liam you did say shabang  laura i did say shabang and 16 for the second  matt okay both hit go ahead and roll damage on each  ashley hit it  music flares up  laura well sort of 15 and eight  matt 15 and eight all right  liam the music is on  matt all right so both arrows 
none	 youve been firing over the top hes kind of hard to see with the  table and from being crouched in the corner but both arrows still manage to barely make their  mark one kind of pins him against the wall and he looks at his shoulder briefly looks back at  you raises his hand as he begins muttering something under his breath as he does your arrow  shnk through his hand and he tries to shake it and now hes pinned to the wall with an arrow in  the middle of his hand  laura 
none	 and ashley yeah  laura trinket oh no i used two attacks  matt yeah  laura dang it  matt you can still tell trinket to move what are you gonna do  laura no no no im gonna hold him there cause hes already in the room  matt okay got you all right so what are you guys doing over in the temple  liam exiting  matt all right  marisha no look and see if theres anything cool first what was that thing thats covered up  by the blanket on the altar  matt 
none	 you keep walking towards it  marisha yeah whats up with that  matt you make your way you look at the top of the dais where the altar is and on top you can  see the black cloth that is wrapped over it the scent gets to you before the actual visual its  freshly rotting flesh of some kind and as you glance over you can see there is a heart that has  been cut from a body and its at the point where the blood has coagulated and begin to become  thick its roughly 
none	 dwarven size  marisha i get up and i grab it in my mouth  matt okay it tastes disgusting  marisha and then i walk over to vax and i lay it at his feet i kind of nudge it with my nose  matt she got you a heart  liam i scritch keyleth behind the ear but nudge it aside with my toe and exit the room  matt okay  liam i did scritch her ears but im going to continue down to the end of the hall  matt this way  liam yeah  
none	 matt okay you make your way into what looks like a giant foyer into a secondary entrance in the  side of the fortress  liam i just walk all the way over to the corner stealthing  matt make a stealth check  liam its high its 28  matt 28 got it okay so as you make your way through you eventually careen to this corner you  can see another hallway what appears to be another room of some kind you also glance back  and see there are two sets of stairways that go up and 
none	 down  liam whats behind me  matt this is a giant foyer that leads outside of the fortress  liam and the edge of the map this way  matt this way here this way this comes to an abrupt end at that point a rocky wall into the  mountain itself that its buttressed up against  liam okay im gonna keep coming this way stealthing  matt all right as you move through  laura whats happening with that dude i are you doing all this while i just pin down  liam yeah i dont know 
none	 whats going on back there im just walking around  matt so you glance in this room theres an open walkway and what appears to be another barrack  section also completely empty  liam screw that do i see a door for this room thats still darkened out then im gonna  keep sliding along the wall  matt okay as you slide along here to make your way around to a door there  liam okay pressing my hand just to see if i can check any for traps  matt okay  liam 26  matt 26 
none	 all right the door does not appear to be trapped  taliesin im gonna be heading in that direction anyway  marisha agreed same here  matt okay  liam i would like to stealth through the door  orion before i leave i carefully examine that statue  matt okay what are you examining  orion the facial features of the god the deity right is that what he is  matt yeah okay so you look at the face of laduguer you can see its very very old its  very wellcrafted you can see a lot of 
none	 very meticulous craftsmanship went into its creation  it almost glistens with a perfection that is out of place in an area that is so covered in soot and  various other volcanic activitybased mineral deposits  orion im gonna do a quick arcana check just to see if theres any kind of mystical thing around  it or anything like that and its 19  matt okay there is some sort of a hum to the air that has an arcane element to it but you are  unable to pinpoint what it necessarily means or what the source 
none	 is  orion interesting knowing that i kind of gather my thoughts and i head towards where the rest of  the group is  matt okay so while youre opening the door the mage in the far corner kind of looks about  sporadically and looks down at the arrow in its hand and its shoulder and just kind of fearfully  wait wait wait wait stop dont attack lets have a conversation  laura speak fast before i kill you  matt he leans forward kind of pulling the arrow out of the doorway groans in pain starts 
none	  hobbling towards you a little bit  laura can we all we go in the room and trinket goes up next to him and like  gets all up in his face  matt okay as you both enter both of you make constitution saving throws as two more plumes of  poison pff out of the ground as both you and trinket walk in  liam good  laura 15  matt 15 okay and for trinket as well  laura oh i shouldve been so smart but i wasnt  laughter  laura 14 for trinket  
none	 matt okay you take seven points of poison damage  laura okay  matt trinket however takes 14 points of poison damage  laura oh man what did i get seven  matt seven and trinket is currently considered poisoned  laura oh no  sam what does that mean  matt it means disadvantage on attack rolls disadvantage on ability checks  laura thats okay  matt and now theres a bear coughing and kind of thrashing about the room the table it bumps into  and it kind of topples over  laura is this like a turn 
none	 thing or can i do something  matt well this is just a reactionary moment of you guys coughing and trying to get out of this  poisonous fume  laura i mean can i quickly cast protection from poison on trinket  matt you can yes  laura okay i do that  matt okay  laura and that cures it  matt that completely removes the poison  laura yes it does  matt okay  laura yay trinket  matt well done so thats your action you now as you are checking the door and you open 
dung	 it up  you hear all this commotion going off to the side now scanlan youre over there as well watching  as more plumes of these poisonous smoke bits  sam if i get close to the door without going through it can i see the guy  matt you can move over and look you can just barely make out his form it is a dark room that  is currently filled with a slowly dissipating green cloud so its hard to make him out  sam okay well then i will just fuck laughs well if i 
none	 cant see him  then i will just yell at him  matt all right  sam ill yell with vicious mockery i dont like you very much for poisoning me and my friends  youre a poopy head  laughter  marisha so vicious  laura that is threatening  marisha damn  sam ooh that does seven points of damage  matt seven points from vicious mockery all right  laughter  matt i dont know how that works  sam its vicious mockery its an attack  matt thats crazy  liam thats like 80 points of 
none	 damage  marisha and who said that words couldnt hurt people  taliesin and bonus damage to his mother wherever she may be  marisha sticks and stones can break my bones but words can hurt  matt okay so it has to make a will saving throw against your dc it rolls a three it does not  so as you shout out into this room the currently fearful duergar mage kind of glances eyes slide  about hears these words and you see him wrack his head for a second with a sudden sense of  selfloathing and 
none	 disappointment  laughter  matt his hands drop and it looks like for a minute his intent to begin muttering some sort of  incantation is momentarily distracted  orion nice  matt all right awesome  ashley can i start moving back  matt yeah you can start moving back this way  liam i hear that but im still going to poke my head stealthily through the door and see what i  see do i need a new stealth check or  matt yes you do  liam okay great so that is a 32  matt 
none	 all right you glance inside at what looks to be some sort of a training room there are  most of the floor itself is stone and in the far corner there is a large section that is mainly  just sand and dirt and there are a number of wooden training structures you know various  shields and wooden bars that are used as a means of training for weaponry theres what looks like  a giant rack of weapons full of arms and stuff  liam anything goodlooking  matt go ahead and make a perception check  
none	 liam one  matt most of the materials in this room look like the basic duergar fare  liam these dont look very good  taliesin i was going to run in and take a look around anyway so  matt laughs okay as you run in go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw  taliesin god damn it okay  sam sings traps traps trapstrapstraps  taliesin 24  matt all right so you take ten points of lightning damage as you feel a tile on the ground  trigger and then spring up and as it does 
none	 you hear this sudden highpitched whine as blue energy  streaks up from the floor runs through your body thankfully you manage to dive out of the way and  touch the ground to ground the energy minimizing the damage but yeah you triggered laughs  triggered a trap plate youre beginning to get the sense that a lot of this tactic of this  fortress now has been to lead you guys through a  marisha maze  matt a maze of traps  sam a labyrinth  liam before we hurt ourselves any longer we should  laura 
none	 weve got to kill this guy or talk to him at least  liam we need to get to the main event here  matt all right at this point kima is now as kima hears you shouting all these curses into the  room kima pushes past you and pushes past you you can see kima coming into the room behind you  guys steps over the broken table down in front of the circle and grabs the mage by the front of  his robe pulling him into her face the mage at this point is still kind 
none	 of reeling from the fact  that you managed to strike him so deeply in the heart of his hearts  sam hes just not a nice man  matt however kima with a look of absolute death in her face grabs him and pulls him forward and  says listen where is the rest of your fucking army  shes going to make an intimidation check  taliesin yeah damn  matt he does not succeed in resisting that  laura yes  matt the duergar is pressed against the wall now and shes slamming him against the back 
none	 of a  bookshelf look all right theyre waiting for you up there all right youre not  going to survive this at this point the entire citys probably waiting for you in the outside of  the fortress and those that are upstairs are wellprepared okay your best chance of survival  is laying down your arms and surrendering im looking out for your best interests here  liam kill this asshole  marisha kill him  matt kima who is still holding him against there you can see her hand releases the scruff  and he takes a 
none	 deep breath for a second but before he can finish exhaling she goes in  immediately grabbing his throat and squeezing it extremely tight as she does you see his tongue  dangling out the side of his mouth strangling noises as shes cutting off his entire air  supply she pulls forward and takes the greatsword and begins to slowly push it into his abdomen as  she does he starts screaming in terrible pain you can see her just slowly pushing the blade  through his body into the bookcase behind as she does she goes youre gonna 
none	 tell me right now  who they have waiting for us upstairs as she begins to push all the way to the hilt now hes  pinned up against the bookcase and probably a portion of the stonework behind him hes now got  blood pouring out the sides of his face and outside the front of his nose the duergar being held  up against the wall says whatever you havent killed the armys probably up with the king  himself theyre all waiting for you and i hope they piss on your body when theyre done at  
none	 which point she takes the blade and twists it as she does he gives this guttural yelp and his eyes  just go blank blanker than the duergar eyes normally are  orion i make it to the doorway and go what is going on in here  laura are there any taking that in any healing potions or anything in  here that we could use  matt go ahead and make an investigation check  sam can i look at the door and see if the trap will go off again if we step through it again  
none	 matt perception check  sam 20  matt looks like from glancing about the room and getting a feel for it there were three traps that  were all placed directly at the front of the door basically to give him a point of defense theyve  all been triggered so you dont have to worry about any more in this room  laura is this still considered the underdark  matt this is yes  laura oh cool  sam im going to go in and look around some more  matt youre looking around as well  sam 
none	 look around for potions and stuff  laura oh thats considered the aw i could have been rolling twice for all these damn things  matt sings remember your abilities  laura sings 25  matt okay  sam whos the singer here people  matt sorry scanlan so as kima pulls the blade from its body kicking it off the greatsword and  wiping it across the leather on the side the leather that you gave to her and a little part of  you is like sadly hmm  liam thats all right worth it this halflings hot 
none	  matt so you guys made your way back clarotas there against the corner and grog rushes over  just feeling like he was ready for action whats going on  ashley youre too late  marisha this might be a good time to stop for a moment  matt thats up to you guys as i say do you guys want to take a short rest  laura did i find any potions did i find anything  matt yes glancing around the room you manage to find two potions of healing one potion of  superior healing  
none	 all ooh  laura what is that thats major  marisha thats cool  matt you also find one vial of some sort of weird viscous yellow liquid  that you cannot identify  marisha oh dont open that who knows how long those guards had to be staked out here  dont open that  sam can i do a can i investigate it or arcana it  matt sure you can give it a go  sam yeah thats a one  laura oh good  sam oh wait no thats a seven these dice are horrible anyway 
none	 it doesnt matter its bad  matt it looks delicious no actually you cant make out it has some changing color as you kind  of swirl the bottle and watch the texture inside shift and change with the centrifugal force you  cant make out anything about its intent but it does feel like its a potion  created with some effect  sam tiberius do you want to drink this  orion no what is it i check it for 18  sam for what  orion for whatever youre trying to hand to me  matt 18 
none	 arcana okay you take a look at it it definitely is magical you dont have a lot of  experience with alchemy but you gather that the effect that it would have upon imbibement would be  to alter your physical form in some way you just dont know the specific effects  orion absolutely scanlan ill take that for now and i put it in my pouch  taliesin lets take a short rest  matt so as you guys all kind of enter this room this brief safe zone to take a short rest if you  feel 
none	 you want to heal yourself up and regain any short restbased abilities do so  marisha can we talk about what this duergar just told us  laura can we go to the bathroom before we do that  matt thats what i was going to say we can return so were going to take a quick bathroom  break were going to play the videos again well return here in just a second as the next element  of the attack on emberhold continues  marisha oh and this is your last chance because after the break well pick

none	 blister  matt so as you guys manage to pull yourself out of your rest mode you now glance out and the  hallways still quiet you can hear the movement of footsteps up above you what is your intent  sam to win  marisha okay wait what are we gonna do cause heres theres an army waiting upstairs for us  liam they know were up there but kima needs her stuff and we need to kind of  put an end to this problem  marisha im gonna hop out of tiger form by the way since 
none	 we rested and stuff  sam wait theyre above us  liam yeah theyre all upstairs including the mind flayer who vanished from the room were in  so im sure he told everyone whats going on but they dont know weve found the secret entrance  so i think we should go vexahlias correct we should use the stairwell  near the secret entrance  orion are we sure theres no other way out of here through this particular floor  is that the only exit  laura theres i mean theres the front entrance theres that door over 
none	 there theres  like two other stairways but we should use this back one by the back entrance  liam also lady kima our purpose here was to find you but your purpose is somewhat greater  than our own what do you suggest we do in this moment  matt as she stands up and she holds the greatsword and swings it a bit what im seeking  lies deeper into this cavern whatever is at the heart of this illithid scourge and she glances  over at clarota whos in the back corner hands folded and theres a 
none	 slight mental hiss sound in  her direction theres something far darker at the heart of this temple ive seen it but i have  my thoughts and my ideas but i need confirmation before i speak of any doomsaying however the  link between those foul creatures and the assault thats currently mounting against kraghammer lie  upstairs at the center of this duergar people  sam oh here here at where we are now yes here  matt the link between this kvarn character  liam and let me ask you this we can be on the same 
none	 page we can go up and fuck shit up however  your weapons and armor would they be a great help should they be our shortterm purpose or  should we just go up and try to end this problem  matt to be honest weve entirely lost the element of surprise i would not wish to sacrifice  as foolishly for a few additional trinkets of my own when i feel that this should do well enough  as long as we manage to work together and be smart about this  laura so we should potentially just leave 
none	 this castle for now and go find kvarn rest up  sam no no no  liam no kima is saying this is the main event  sam she just said theres a link upstairs the link from to kvarn that we need to  laura i get it okay yeah  matt how do you think kvarn is able to send these armies up again and again towards the back  door of kraghammer  laura right  matt besides if we go on and leave them as they are whos to say they wouldnt come up behind us 
none	  and then were fighting a twosided front once we get there  laura then lets we gotta go upstairs  liam vox machina our years are short lets make good use of them  sam lets leave this decision up to grog  orion absolutely not  laughter  matt grogs standing there clutching his greataxe i say i havent been able to kill much  since we got here lets kill something  orion thats a terrible idea  laura have some ale before we go out grog  matt oh yeah of course and he goes into 
none	 his bag of holding and pulls out his now halfempty  cask and you see him frown as he hears it clink around he pours everyone a small drink to what  is now an empty cask  laura this could potentially kill us all  travis vox machina  all vox machina  laura scanlan had a great idea though should we talk about what scanlan wants to do  sam ah yes i have an idea but also are there two stairs up to the top floor  liam theres multiple  sam perhaps we should use more 
none	 than one one half of our band go up create a diversion the  other half sneak up and kill kill kill thats one option the other option  liam pike leads the diversion group  ashley definitely the stealthy ones with me  laughter  sam ah i do have an idea about gaining the upper hand on our first meeting with this army thats  upstairs an intimidation technique of some sort  marisha youre not going to kill another pony are you  sam i cant anymore  marisha good  sam much as i would love 
none	 to no but weve heard over our eavesdropping that some of these duergar  bastards are scared of that strange chimera sort of hodgepodge human centipede thing we could be  one of those with a little bit of deception and all of us sort of piling on each other we could  act like a big scary monster and go up and freak the fuck out of them  marisha ah thats actually a really good idea  laura  all of us piled on grog and trinket and you as the bases and we become this  sam 
none	 they would probably be at least for the moment intimidated a bit and we could get a few  licks in before they realized were just a pile of idiots running at them  laughter  laura i like it  marisha so were basically gonna be like three kids little rascalsstyle on each others  shoulders with a giant coat  sam but that could be the diversion at least  marisha okay well then why dont i actually like this idea why dont we have a few of our  stealthy members why dont we have the twins 
none	 be in the shadows and picking people off while  laura thats true cause ive got range so that makes sense  marisha right why dont we have some of our ranged people ill transform i can transform  into how about a giant scorpion that sounds fun  sam can you transform into anything  marisha i can transform into beasts they have to be beasts  sam how about the type of beast that we know would scare them like that big triceratops thing  that we saw with the big metal thing on it  marisha i 
none	 can be a rhinoceros i can be like can i do dinosaurs i can be a dinosaur right  thats a new thing i can be right  matt up to a certain point  liam what if you were a scorpion with a dragonborn tail sliding around and a gnome on your  front leg and a  marisha well heres oh wait wait okay okay okay okay okay okay hang on hang on hang on  this might be crazy wonder what would happen if i drank that weird yellowish potion  while im a monster  laura 
none	 no it could be poison though  marisha but im wondering if you can like if i can transform into a monster and then you with  polymorph can maybe just transform  orion stop talking stop talking hold on  laughter  marisha you dont have to snap at me  orion no no no youre brilliant your highness  marisha oh thank you i mean  orion i have an idea i have an idea  liam were off the rails here  laura tell it to us tiberius whats the idea  sam does it involve shitting 
none	 on a bed  laughter  orion eventually actually yes  taliesin arent you empty yet  orion this is whats going to happen as far as we know theyre all duergar up there correct  laura mostly except for the mind flayers and another big monster probably they might have  ashley which i saw in a vision i think thats whats controlling them  laura oh no thats kvarn no no no hes at the other one  ashley sorry read it wrong  orion this is what will happen those who can go stealth we will creep 
none	 up there i will go  invisible myself i will be in front you closely behind me  sam he has a name  orion vax there we go you closely behind me and whoever else can stealth follows suit i will  cast alter self and turn myself into their god  sam their god  all kvarn  marisha but you dont know what he looks like  laura oh or into that other thingie  orion i absolutely know what he looks like  matt you mean laduguer  orion we just saw his statue  marisha 
none	 well thats not kvarn though  orion but thats who they worship as i give my whatever the hell i come up with to say at that  particular time  sam maybe you should think it first think it through first  orion as soon as the mind flayers catch on and i turn to clarota and i turn to kima thats when  all of you will strike at them first the rest of you will wait til i shoot off a couple of  fireballs at the duergar once they figure out were full of crap cause 
none	 im sure that might  happen unless im super convincing which i hope thats the case but i think thats our best bet  to keep a certain element of surprise  marisha so wait so wait are you going to be their god and im still going to also be a crazy  monster as like your pet crazy monster with our stealthy team or just  taliesin i think the only thing better than their god would be their god on top of a giant  scorpion  laura and marisha ooh  liam i have faith in 
none	 you tiberius  marisha youll be like xerxes  ashley can i cast cause ive been wanting to use thaumaturgy which can make your voice three  times as louder  matt at the moment he would be speaking yeah  ashley at the moment hed be speaking okay so lets do that  laura oh thats going to be so cool  marisha some theatrics  liam i love it when a good plan comes together  sam so some of us are stealthing youre being a big god who talks loud and is riding a scorpion  ashley 
none	 so maybe ill tuck behind him on top of you the scorpion and then when youre getting  ready to talk ill just whoosh and then youll your voice will be you know youll have  liam yeah thats good thats good  sam how about this so just to clarify are we all going up the same staircase or are we going  up two separate staircases vex and vax  laura i think we should just go up the same staircase theres too many of them if we split  up we could just all die  sam 
none	 you dont know what there could be a million rooms up there  liam we have no idea whats up there but tiberius has got a plan i like it  laura if hes the god we just go in behind him as the god  ashley what if we did like your dimension door is it too not very godlike if hes coming up the  staircase like hey  sam the dimension doors off the table  liam tiberius tiberius tibs  sam but dont use the god thing but dont use the god thing until we get 
none	 to the big group the  big thing if you see a guard dont turn into a god you gotta see like more than five people  before you turn into a god  liam tiberius  orion yes vax  liam do you intend to go up one of the other stairways i believe this one by the entrance the  secret entrance we came in will afford us the element of surprise do you think you want to go  up one of the others  orion no lets go up that one  liam and make a 
none	 distraction right your plan is to make a distraction  orion yes of course  liam youre a brave dragonborn  marisha im going to cast pass without a trace on the party everyone stay close  liam whos the stealth party not you you and me you  marisha well all of us all of us i guess until we get upstairs  laura potentially all of us will be stealthed except for tiberius and you who is a scorpion  and you whos riding behind tiberius  ashley im riding on her so i probably wont be rolling 
none	 for stealth  matt uh  ashley just kidding  matt youll be rolling  ashley i probably wont roll well just putting it out there  matt you hear in the back of your mind this subtle soft echoing chuckle youre all crazy  i like it  laughter  matt at which point kima whos listening to all this with a look of kind of awe and curiosity  says you know for once i actually agree with the thing  laughter  matt all right takes her greatsword in her hands lead the way  ashley so 
none	 you guys are stealthing up first  marisha we all have pass without a trace as long as you stand close enough  liam wait wait for the inspiration  sam i have some inspiration dice to give out that i can give out as bonus actions can i give  it out before we go into battle  matt i would say like momentarily right beforehand  sam okay good to know but i cant mass give it out just have to give it to one person  matt its one of those things where it has to be 
none	 in the moment when the adrenalines pumping i  think for it to last into the combat  sam okay and do we want to send clarota and kima off through a different staircase so we have at  least a backup plan  laura no no no stick together too big of a group of an army upstairs to split us up  liam dont split the party  sam in those action movies when theres one guy who goes away for a while he comes back at the  end and saves the day if we did that 
none	  laura thats not going to be us  liam we few we happy few  laughter  liam about to go and do something very stupid lets do it  matt so you are venturing up which stairway  laura the secret one the one by in the storage room  matt all right so you guys  marisha we got this we got this  laura oh no grog fell over oh my gosh  marisha its been a good day what are you going to say are you thinking about this  think about something  orion 
none	 okay  marisha start thinking about this now  liam there are rooms up there  taliesin whats the name of the god again  marisha laduguer  ashley can i take off my armor right now  matt youd become a soft target all right you guys all make your way up and youre all  squeezing into this tiny tiny room youre all shouldertoshoulder essentially you come up to  the top area theres a small box and there is just a single stone door  laura check for traps  liam excuse me sorry sorry sorry sorry 
none	 sorry sorry sorry sorry excuse me kima sorry  sorry all right my hands are on the door im going to check for traps on this door  i get a 21  matt okay you take a moment and you place your hand along this stone surface you find that  theres a low hum to it  liam careful careful careful  matt and you can tell that theres a small almost like a thin whisper of string laid across  the very top of the stone where the wall meets it  liam of course i can 
none	 of course i can im going to take care of this hold on yeah this is  thieves tools correct 26  matt 26 okay you come up and you find that this is a very very fine hair trigger this is  actually a partial enchantment as part of a magical trap you know that with the slightest  hint of false vibration to it the door shifting or hitting it in the wrong place will trigger  whatever this trap is and so you bring your tools up you manage to place one at the base of each 
none	  point at where this arcane silver thread lies across simultaneously you take your daggers and  place them underneath the thread at each ends and sever them both at the same time the thin whisper  of a string just slowly glides down and vanishes into a small sparkle of light  sam cut the red wire  liam im just going to lay my ear on the door and see what i can hear that is 21  matt hearing it you hear what sounds like a low mutter of somewhere in the neighbourhood of ten to  
none	 15 low voices and the slow small shuffling of many many many many footsteps  liam shuffling you said and if i listen for a moment do i does it continue  matt it kind of couple of footsteps some talking soft footprints you can hear the  scraping of metal  liam and its the only way we can go is through this door right  were all smooshed into this hallway  matt there is a hallway this way  laura oh so we stealth down the other hall we try  liam so i mooshed everyone away 
none	 from this hall  matt the whispers and voices arent directly on the other side of this wall theyre just in that  room echoing through but you do hear a lot of people there all right so what are you doing  laura well well stealthing down that hallway can we check for traps check for traps i look  im perceiving  matt laughs roll for perceiving  laughter  liam 23 for vax  laura oh i get twice that good oh good that was way better  matt laughs  laura ten  matt okay no 
none	 traps  laura yay  matt you both glide your way up and peek around the corner what you see immediately are six  duergar all stationed in this hallway guarding what looks like two large doors and entrance to  this main chamber and theyre all just standing there weapons ready looking around  sam wait which is the main chamber that you just  matt this big chamber here that you  sam oh that we were listening to at the door  liam vax sneaks back to the group and motions tiberius over and keyleth over  
none	 sam were doing this  liam one moment one moment lightning lightning who knows lightning  marisha are you gonna try to lightning bolt an entire line  liam do you know the magic of lightning ive seen you do it before ive seen you  marisha i do know it right now  liam you know it anyone who knows lightning ive seen it done on the battlefield with us  person to person to person  sam i can do it  matt who is up once again clearing his throat in your presence  sam hi scanlan 
none	 here  liam scanlan you know how to harness the power of electricity  sam i dont wanna brag but im a regular ben franklin over here hes a guy hes a gnome i  knew once  marisha scanlan can you and i focus our call lightning spells together to lightning these  sam i mean mines so fricking powerful  liam if scanlan and one of the others does lightning at the same time and it goes through  that line we could drop them all at once  laura but thats noisy theyll come out  liam 
none	 its not that noisy its not like armor banging around  laura i think its gonna be noisy its not a stealthy attack  taliesin its a quick way to get rid of six people though  orion oh is that what we need to do  liam theres a row of duergar around the corner theyre all in a line like radio city we just  if i can get scanlan if you what about you keyleth do i remember light or do you bring it  down from above tiberius  orion what what  sam do you 
none	 want me to shock em  orion oh i have an idea okay ill peek around  matt okay make a stealth check  orion sweet  marisha you have plus ten because of my pass without a trace  liam youve got six duergar in a row is there anything you can do thats  orion 27  matt thats when you see this long row of duergar that are all kind of armored and ready guarding  the front of this chamber  orion i cast watery sphere at the end of the last guy and create a 
none	 giant ball  liam wait youre doing it now  orion what does it look like vax  matt okay so this giant water sphere appears at which side of the wall  orion on the last guy yeah and i draw it towards us  liam vax is grabbing the gnome and tossing him out to the right  out here at the front of the group  orion and i stop at the last guy  matt okay as the water sphere begins to pull in saving throws whats your dc  orion my spell dc 17  
none	 matt this is a dexterity save all right  sam one at a time  matt all of them fail  cheering  marisha this is gonna be cool this is gonna be cool its gonna put them all in one spot  sam they were already in a line  marisha no now we can electrocute them and theyre wet  matt there is now an entire clustered sphere of water that is containing a mishmash of duergar  marisha lightning bolt  matt call lightning all right so as keyleth you step forward out in the hallway you 
dung	 bring  your arm up and theres this small cluster of dark clouds beginning to form and swirl up on the top  of the 20foot hallway as it swirls you bring your arm downward and theres a sudden crack of  thunder a loud blasting sound that echoes through the hallway as the lightning strikes the center  of the sphere the water itself bursts as the actual cacophonous blast of the lightning loosely  shakes the aquatic sphere however go ahead and roll damage  marisha do i get any more damage because of the  matt you 
none	 get an additional two dice of damage to each one of the duergar because they are contained  in the water  orion yeah  marisha so 5d10  matt correct  marisha do i roll for each one  matt you just roll once and thats across the board for all of them and they are at a  disadvantage because they are in the sphere  marisha oh and theyre at a disadvantage  orion yeah yeah because im like holding them up  marisha all right  matt its really funny because two of them rolled 20s 
none	 in a row but theyre at a  disadvantage  marisha nice not too shabby so we have ten 19 plus 18 bringing it to 28 plus three 31 plus  one 32  matt okay so the sphere explodes the actual stone on the ground you can feel shake and shudder  with the impact of the lightning storm all but one of the duergar are blown apart and scattered  across the wall akirastyle just splat against the walls one of them is still in the center of  the sphere now looking charred and burnt and eyes 
none	 wide open with anger and frustration  marisha scanlan go  sam i say chants you ugly you ugly yo mama says you ugly and i cast vicious mockery  laughter  matt he rolled a 14 vs the dc which i think is  sam 19  matt all right how much total did you do  sam just a five  matt how much did you do total  marisha 32 total  matt hold on so as the duergar is currently held aloft in this aquatic sphere halfcharred and  burnt with pieces of his friends floating 
none	 in the water around him he hears through this kind of  warbling sound you ugly you ugly and he sees everyone kind of step in the hallway clapping with  you and he kind of looks around at himself looks at his situation and eventually just gives up  and takes a big old gulp of water and drowns inside the aquatic sphere  laughter  sam yes i shamed him to death  ashley amazing  marisha laughs what a terrible way to die  matt good news is you guys royally screwed over six duergar one of 
none	 which  you shamed him to death  laughter  matt you have definitely however announced your presence at the chamber  liam vax spanks tiberius on the tail and says get ready to deity going stealth  marisha i say i go get on my back get on my back and i piggyback him  matt you transform  orion i do  matt no marisha did you transform  marisha well im piggybacking him just now im literally just piggybacking tiberius waiting  matt okay so tiberius you leap onto her back  orion mmhm and i cast 
none	 alter self and i turn to  liam scanlan vex  ashley im going to cast the thing on him  matt okay so you cast thaumaturgy on him to give him a vocal emphasis a roaring booming voice do  you stay with him or do you move back with the rest of the group  marisha oh oh pike pike pike pike pike what kind of animal would this god use would you know  what kind of animal the duergar would worship do you know  orion its a religion check  matt religion check  marisha 
dung	 what kind of animals he might like you know check out you know animals  ashley 14  matt you have no idea you know the deity exists you dont know of any sort of animal beast or  creature symbolism that would befit a duergar god  ashley i have no idea  marisha i guess a scorpion a scorpion sounds good scorpion giant scorpion  matt keyleths form shifts as you see a bunch of arachnidlike legs sprawl out the side of her  torso her form condenses into a dark chitinous shell as two giant claws form 
none	 out the side of her body  and a giant poison stinger curls up from behind tiberius kind of holds on during the  transformation  ashley im going to go back because if they see me then theyll know somethings fishy  matt all right the rest of you are here so you feel this kind of divine energy cascade around  your throat you can feel your vocal cords themselves are temporarily infused with some sort  of divine presence youve transformed yourself now into the visage of this duergar deity  standing at probably a good what 
none	 height are you going at  orion how tall are the  matt the duergar are about fourandahalf feet tall  orion so lets make him six feet tall  matt all right sixfoottall duergar standing there  laura the two of us get back by the other twin door and get ready to bust into that entrance  sam im with them were the stealth party  liam im in fact nudging grog away from this door towards the front towards tiberius i dont know  theyre not that strong  matt what are you doing grog says which 
none	 way which way do i go  liam vax kicks grog in the butt and sends him forward go help tiberius  matt im walking back for you  laura grog dont do that not that far grog come back because if they see him  orion no stay in the corner grog wait til i say help me and then come kill everything  matt he looks like hes listening mostly  laughter  marisha back him up back him up  matt you hear shifting in the doorway from the front where you guys are whats the plan 
none	 whats  doing what  sam whos going in first  orion is this going to be the entrance where were going in  laura yeah you bust in and be a god  marisha oh are we busting in  laura when you give it well go in the other way  marisha fuck if i know  orion thats your job bust the door open  matt all right go ahead and make an athletics check  liam im simultaneously checking our door for no i already did its unlocked and untrapped  never mind  marisha giant 
none	 scorpion athletics plus my dex im assuming  matt no plus your strength  marisha strength thats pretty cool though 22  matt a 22  marisha i rolled a 19  matt all right the doors splinter open the doors are actually broken off the hinges  orion as that happens i cast light and i cast prestidigitation  sam concentrate dont cast too much shit  orion i cant hear whats going on i hear some annoyances in the background as i cast  prestidigitation to make my voice louder  laura no she already did it its 
none	 three times louder than it normally would be  orion oh shit  marisha so just keep focusing on your light  matt as you guys come bursting in  liam holy shit  laura yeah theres a lot of them  marisha maybe do some prestidigitation where you move shit around  ashley oh ho ho what  marisha oh hello everybody  liam and laura grog voice i would like to rage  laura oh no basilisks  liam what  laura those thingies  marisha oh thats right they have those pet basilisks remember  matt so 
none	 the doors burst open and you guys come through all of the duergar stand there with their  weapons at the ready you can see in the back on this raised platform where the cloth stops there  is two thrones at the top two duergar sitting on the thrones at the ready you can see two kind of  lizardlike creatures in the back on chained leashes however all of the duergar that are  ready to strike as you burst through take a step back looking extremely confused about whats  going on  orion shouts silence all 
none	 of you silence  sam we werent talking  orion who knows who i am  matt make a persuasion check  marisha get it get it get it  liam yep yep yep yep yep vax is quietly moving along the back wall  sam our door is open  liam it is now  laura yeah were going to try to stealth in and sneak attack them  orion 16  laura oh god oh god  matt okay the duergar in the front take another step back looking both frightened and awed the  one nearest to 
none	 you takes his hammer and throws it to the ground and takes a knee  orion well it looks like theres one saved soul at this point in time  matt at which point two of the other ones nearby kind of look at each other and look back at the  one whos on on the ground they put their hammers down and they kneel as well at which point in  the back you see the two throned figures stand up one of which you can barely see in the dim light  outside of your light spell 
none	 thats currently gleaming above you this long  almosttouchingthefloor black braided beard that drags right over this heavyset plate of  jagged black iron metal a giant sword in his hand youre kneeling below this false idol  orion silence  matt this imposter  orion as i cast as i say silence i blow a big plume of fire out of my mouth  and i cast control flames  matt so the light pff  orion i dont cast control flames i just do the fireball for effect i dont do control flames  because thats a concentration 
none	 spell  matt all right so you do fireball where are you casting fireball or just doing it to do it  orion just fwoosh  matt plume of flame roll an intimidation check  taliesin you guys what are you doing right now  liam im moving along the back wall i want that illithid  orion 18  matt okay make a stealth check who else is going in there with him  laura i go in and stand at the walls next to the door  liam 32  matt okay your stealth roll  ashley im

none	 first strike that is a that hits and that strike does just enough damage she  cleaves that basilisk in two with her first strike with her first strike using the inertia  she turns around and strikes at king murghol  however king murghol seeing her come forward takes his sword up and manages to parry  hers to the side both of them lock for a second as he steps into her and kind of glares into her  face oh youre supposed to be downstairs for playtime pushes her off with his blade  marisha playtime i

none	 kima rears back her first strike comes down and hits overhead into king  murghols armor and as it does it hits the blade only goes about a few inches in but then  all of a sudden the blade heats up whitehot and actually buries itself an additional six inches  into his shoulder he screams out in pain reaches up and grabs the blade and as he does his hand  actually burns in the process she pulls the blade out around and swings it down again sinking  another eight inches into the side of his torso 
none	 this time with a giant arc of white divine light  into the side he looks like hes starting to bleed out from the two of the wounds really  heavily the king is looking a little rough that ends kimas turn kimas going to try and make a  saving throw kima pulls the blade out and turns to stone herself  laura oh shit shit shit shit hes still at like really high health too the king  sam what he is  matt the king is looking a little rough  sam you never know he might 
none	 just start doing a headstand  laughter  matt the queens turn  laura oh no  matt the queen looks over at grog in front of her kinda frustratedly uses a bulk of sorcery  points puts her hand up towards him as hes pulling his axe back angrily he fails his save  and he puts his axe back down and looks towards the rest of the group  marisha oh no not again  matt eye color glazed over  sam hes so easily influenced  laura no hes under her control  matt so that was 
none	 her sorcery points her quick action she then says were not gonna die this  day alone and i wont die my love im sorry but theres much more work to be done and she raises  her hand up and you see this buildup of green arcane energy at her hand she turns it towards  the rest of the group faces it up towards the ceiling and releases this pulse of arcane green  illlooking energy that blasts into the stone ceiling as it does the stone itself  disintegrates in a large chunk and a glowing mass 
none	 of seeping hot molten magma begins to pour  into the room  marisha oh shit  orion wheres it coming from  matt its now coming from right here  laura oh my god  liam sings tpk tpk  matt so now magma is pouring onto the throne room from above the giant fall that is on top of  the fortress is now peering into the room  sam highpitched someone grab me and leave  matt that brings us to tiberius who is stone clarota currently looks around and  orion hold on am i conscious 
none	 in stone form  matt no you are a slate you are a blue screen you are grog after the intellect devourer  ashley oh god this is bad  matt okay laughs  sam pike its all on you dude  marisha do you have water  ashley i can create it  matt clarota steps back and grabs lady kima and begins dragging her back through the doorway  laura oh god weve got to get out thats a retreat  matt pulling her down towards the stairway that brings us to keyleth  sam keyleth keyleth get 
none	 us out of here  marisha okay okay okay i come out of the form yes thank you  matt its a free action  orion isnt there a dead basilisk right in front of us right now  matt there is a body of a dead basilisk on the ground yes  marisha im going to take wind wall im gonna cast wind wall and try and wrap it around the lava  column and try and contain it within the wind wall cooling it down essentially making a  tornadolike vortex around the lava  matt okay for 
none	 the purposes of this i want you to go ahead and make a basic religion check  marisha okay  matt wait no not religion for you itd be nature just for the purposes of my thought i  think a nature check would be an interesting way to see how this plays out  marisha 18  matt 18 okay so as you bring this gust of cold wind swirling around the column of magma begins  to cool and darken as trinket is like backing up against the wall and the magma is starting to  singe the 
dung	 edge of trinkets nails it cools to a dark black kind of rockish color and the magma  fall ceases but you can see parts of it breaking and beginning to break past that shell exterior  so youve slowed it  marisha this isnt gonna hold for long somebody rub some blood on tiberius quick and lets get  the hell out of here im just holding this  matt holding it there okay that brings us to pike  ashley theres so much to do i dont know if i should heal you if i should rub blood 
none	 on you or  if i should go try to remove the curse from grog  laura see if you can get the curse out of grog because if weve got to retreat then  ashley can remove curse remove the thing off of him  matt from your knowledge no its an arcane effect not a curse  ashley thats an arcane effect okay so grog might be on his own for a little bit okay so can  i heal scanlan and then also rub some basilisk blood on tiberius  matt from your previous experience its not 
none	 the blood directly the blood itself has to be  distilled into a specific alchemical form to reverse the effect  orion we just drank the blood last time  matt no it wasnt drinking after the battle you guys took the blood prepared it and then  used it as part of the recovery  marisha will someone collect some blood  matt okay so you heal scanlan how much does he heal  orion the kings almost dead  marisha do we want to kill the king do we need somebody alive to help us  ashley oh 
none	 19 19  matt so youre healed 19 youre on the ground prone but youre conscious now  sam hi  matt you look up at pike and smile and you look over and see this large column of magma thats now  cracking through stone and pouring into the throne room again  ashley is there anything else we can do is there anything else i can do at this moment  matt no this has been a heal this has been no okay you can move thats about it  ashley i can move can i take anyone 
none	 with me while i move  matt i will say you can drag him youll be at half speed  ashley can i try to drag tiberius away from the magma  matt you can try make a strength check  sam youre two feet tall hes a dragon  matt lets say athletics do athletics  ashley athletics 19  matt okay so you grab onto tiberius you rush over after healing him grab and start dragging  him towards the entrance at halfspeed you manage to get him three squares thats as far as you  got as 
none	 youre pulling back the king as a reaction gets one strike on you with his sword  thats gonna be a 19  ashley get outta here  laughter  matt your ac is 20  ashley its 20  matt so the blade hits you  ashley i just flip him off  laughter  matt the blade comes down towards you but with a flash of divine energy in your shoulder armor it  just gets deflected off the side and you glare at him out of the side of your face and continue to  drag tiberius 
none	 out of the room  liam now go home and get your shine box  laughter  matt all right percy youre up  taliesin all right im going to step into the room to give some cover right about probably  just slightly on the other end of this  matt where over here  taliesin no like next to keyleth like near keyleth  matt oh youre gonna have to go around here then this is a really harrowing place  taliesin okay the first thing im going to do is im going to ive got my ice 
none	 shot loaded im  going to take a shot at the break in the ceiling and im gonna try and ice it over  matt okay all right so as you pull over you go ahead and aim up with your ice shot ready go  ahead and fire  taliesin thats 20  matt 20 definitively hits its not hard to do go ahead and roll damage and that will signify how  long and how much it will stop so just the ice damage not the actual bullet it wont do  anything so just  taliesin oh 
none	 so just the ice damage  matt just the ice damage  taliesin two  matt two okay so as you blast up you can see as the magmas beginning to pour down again you  blast it and it immediately a spot cools into a rock and begins to slip again youve maybe given  yourself a couple more seconds that may be what you need you dont know but thats all you got  on that one  taliesin okay my next shot im just gonna turn to the king and just shoot  matt okay go for 
none	 it  taliesin im also gonna spend a point for additional damage and im also taking  sharpshooter for additional damage  matt okay  taliesin thats 16  matt 16 versus armor class will not hit unfortunately  taliesin oh wait okay no i just i dont get the oh god its not pathfinder gah  matt yeah  taliesin okay thats fine im gonna spend my bonus action to take another shot  matt okay so youre using your action surge  taliesin yeah  matt okay so action surge you now have two more attacks go for 
none	 it  taliesin 23 eff you  matt that hits  laughter  taliesin thats nine points of damage  matt nine points of damage got it  taliesin taking another shot  matt all right  taliesin this shots fire fire bonus damage and im also gonna spend another grit point to maybe  do a little more damage 28 to hit  matt that hits go ahead and roll damage with the extra grit point you do two dice right  taliesin yeah i get a bonus die i just have to find one oh thatll do thats 
none	 17 points of  damage plus one point of fire damage  matt nice okay so the next the first shot fires just ricochets off his armor and streaks  across the room you get his attention though and he looks back at you with this kind of wild  look in his eyes the muscles tensing you can see the armor actually bending and twisting against  his physical form underneath however the next shot blasts off side of his jaw theres actually  a giant gap now in his flesh as he looks back at you and you 
none	 can see his teeth and as he grits  down towards you now definitely intent on getting vengeance on that the second shot impact sound  takes off a chunk of his head you can see the skull exposed on where youve now taken a piece of  flesh off the top of his scalp hes looking pretty rough  taliesin lets move it people and im gonna take like a step back towards the door just with  whats remaining of my movement  matt okay you can get back to there all right that brings us to  
none	 taliesin oh i killed him didnt i no hes not dead damn it  matt hes not dead yet not dead yet  taliesin i know that wouldve been so cool  matt all right the mind flayer who is no longer dominated as clarota took his attention off of  that for the time being looks around at everyone sees the circumstance the magma flowing down and  just grabs his chest and you can see his form blink out and vanish  orion groans he peaced out  matt that brings us to the top vax at this 
none	 round by the way is broken and has begun to  spread the magma has now filled this much of the room and its quickening  liam my boots of haste are on so i run i just dart right around grog around that column up to  the queen while pulling out my keen dagger i speak my mothers name kiss the blade and shove  it in right into her collarbone  matt all right go ahead and roll for the attack  liam so thats a two but im gonna use luck i get ad 20  
none	 matt 20 does hit  liam because of it and because grogs there this  matt grog is not an ally currently you do not get sneak attack  liam dont get sneak attack all right three ten then thats the first attack and the second  one also hits thats a 29  matt all right  liam is ten  matt ten nice so the first blade plunges into her clavicle she maneuvers out of the way to the  point where it misses any vital points but still sinks in she looks at you angrily and you 
none	 can see  her dull white ashy duergar eyes flash with an intense arcane rage as you pull the blade out  her eyes dart around with some sort of a plan a thought process going through her head as the  other blade sinks into the side of her torso she spits out blood that actually spatters across your  face she pushes the blade out and you see her preparing herself for something that ends your  turn grog currently moves forward towards you  liam grog voice wrong direction  matt that is a 25 versus armor 
none	 class  liam yeah but uncanny dodge  matt how many times can you youve already used that its once per encounter once per encounter  you can use that next one is a 21 versus armor class  liam once a round  matt once a round you can do it okay well never mind so take half on that first attack all  right so first strike comes at you with a oof thatll be 19 points of damage reduced to nine  liam yeah okay  matt second strike hits you for a total of 15 points 
none	 of damage so 24 total  marisha could be worse  matt and thats grogs go that brings us to scanlan  liam that really hurts grog  sam with my knowledge of the arcane arts do i have any knowledge that using my dispel magic  spell would work on grog or do i just have to try it  matt its a possibility you know the spell thats been cast on him you use it there is a  chance but it has to be a contested roll  liam you could roll a 20  marisha you 
none	 could roll a 20  sam does it take my move to just stand up  matt yes it does unfortunately so its your call  sam but i dont have to be standing to cast a spell  matt no but i would say its going to be difficult its going to give  sam all right ill stand up  matt all right you get back up what are you doing  sam and i will jesus is it better for me to get out of there or get the king  laura yeah get the king you 
none	 may be able to kill him hes on his last legs probably  matt hes looking pretty rough  sam yeah but keyleth is right behind him  liam do it stab him  laura you can attack him with your sword  sam i am a tiny tiny boy i can only do  laura do it anyway hes at his last legs it would be epic scanlan  matt what do you got go ahead quick magmas pouring through  sam okay i swing my singing dawnblade at him laughs i have a dawn blade its just so 
none	 lame  though its so weak  matt okay so go ahead and roll for an attack d20  sam a natural 20  cheering  marisha we said he could roll a 20 we called it who called it we called it  matt so roll the dice  sam so thats eight  matt you rolled an eight times two thats 16 plus whatever the bonus damage is for the sword  sam plus seven plus the dawn blade gets another bonus attack at disadvantage  matt it does so you strike with a critical hit doing lets 
none	 see thats eight 16 plus seven  23 points of damage go ahead and roll for a second attack  sam ive never hit anyone with a sword before five  ashley can i give him a war gods blessing and give him a plus ten  matt you can  ashley all right plus ten so fifteen  matt so whats your total you rolled a five plus  sam five plus ten i dont know what am i adding ive never used a sword before  matt add your proficiency modifier which is four plus your strength modifier 
none	 so thats five  to that which is ten makes it 20 which hits roll damage on the attack  cheering  marisha kill him kill him  sam six  matt six points of damage all right six on that plus your strength which is one seven plus the  dawn blade which is thats eight so thats eight damage on top of the 23  how do you want to do this  cheering  sam i as i draw back the blade i say oh you shouldve stood on your head and i lop it off  
none	 matt so as you say that you the blade vibrates to the sound of your voice like the  echoing of a song of scanlan behind yours in almost a chorus out of nowhere the blade streaks  through the air coming down slitting across the back of his achilles tendon he instinctually  falls to one knee which is kind of the height level for you as you do you bring the blade  around with a flourish and take murghols head off his shoulders it spins tumbles to the ground  and rolls across the floor into the 
none	 magma blackened beard curling back as the rest of his  face is melted away by the lava which is now pouring pretty heavily into this room  sam sings scanlan make you feel good  matt all right so thats your action and your movement and your bonus action no you did your  bonus action to do the extra attack  sam oh great great i dont know how to use swords  matt all right so thats the end of your turn wow you used a sword and got a kill on a boss  sam yay 
none	  ashley good job scanlan  matt all right king murghols turn would be now but hes on the ground vex  laura i call trinket back get him away from that lava i run past cause i cant can i see do i  have an angle or is it being blocked by molten tornado  matt you its completely blocked right now  laura can i run across behind it  matt through here  laura yeah is that magmous right now  matt yeah it is its still pouring she slowed it down but its still breaking 
none	 through and  pouring out slower it would be even bigger if they hadnt slowed it  laura okay then well maybe i wont run in that direction i run in the other direction and down  yeah so i can see  matt go for it roll for an attack  laura okay  matt first attack  laura first attack is sings 20 no 19  matt hits  laura yes okay 14  matt 14 points of damage  laura second attack is second attack is sings 21  matt hits roll damage on that  laura 
none	 whats that 12  matt 12 to hit  laura yeah  matt or 12 damage  laura 12 damage  matt all right 12 damage  laura oh um hunters mark damn it  bonus action  matt yep all right so both arrows impact sounds one clips her in the leg and the other  embeds itself in her abdomen you see she grabs for it shes looking really rough next is kima  kimas stone its now the queens turn she looks over at you whos stabbed her the arrows in her  abdomen and she looks 
none	 up at grog and says sighs weve got business elsewhere and she  reaches out and touches grog both of them blink out dimension door  sam weve lost grog again  matt a very familiar purplish color as youve seen you cast it they dimension door out of the  entire vicinity  sam son of a  marisha this is the second time weve lost grog  matt at which point the stone rocks crack on the column and the magma now goes into full pour  laura weve got to get out  matt you guys have 
none	 to get out of that tunnel what do you do now whats the process  ashley we run  sam wait we gotta get our stone friends out  matt so this is going into a skill challenge now  laura yeah we all run out that  sam no we dont all run out theyre stone we have to drag them out yeah  liam who alls stone its tiberius and kima okay  marisha can we wheres the magic carpet throw their asses on the magic carpet  laura grog has the magic carpet grog had everything

none	  matt 18 okay so i mean you go over to it and you manage to gather up into your wine skin a  little bit of basilisks blood best you can the magma pulls close to you and you manage to just  take six points of fire damage from just the general heat of the magma now pouring into the  room its spilling out and now just continuing to fill the rest of this chamber  liam i shout to percy come tiberius now  taliesin we pick him up  matt both of you guys make 
none	 an athletics check  sam oh its not a strength check  matt for this this is just an athletics to pull them all off  liam 19  taliesin 17  matt okay you guys grab and pull tiberius out of the room it takes the two of you to heft him  over you manage to pull him out of the way that works out well down the stairway all right we  dont need the video for this were just going to do this visually so you guys manage to bring  tiberius down the stairway what

dung	 matt okay tiberius is  laura 29  matt okay gotcha so pike and scanlan both of you guys are unfortunately cause youre smaller  and your legs are moving you guys rush down the stairway and curl around as the rest of you make  your way to the door which is currently closed you are all kinda gathered at the exterior of  that hidden doorway its currently dark and held shut on where you guys entered however you two  the magmas now reached the stairway its beginning to pour down off the top and it manages 
none	  to catch the two of you you guys each take five points of heat damage from the magmas proximity  liam to the two ladies  matt no pike and scanlan you guys make it to the bottom floor the doorway is currently closed  for the secret exit of the fortress  liam vax drops tiberius stone ass to the ground and starts feeling to get the mechanism of the  door open  sam are we at the foot of the stairs yet me and pike  matt you guys just make it to the foot of 
none	 the stairs you guys are now  marisha its a big stone door  matt yeah its the one you guys the one you guys it opens up outward  marisha i just cast stone shape and make a hole  matt okay as youre feeling around for the mechanism keyleth steps forward and basically the  stone turns into almost a clay and she just pulls it apart  marisha sorry vax i didnt mean to like overstep there  matt a giant glob of magma pours down and splashes down onto the ground hitting everyone in  the 
none	 vicinity everyone down here takes 12 points of heat damage  liam ah its hot its hot its hot  laura hot hot hot hot hot  liam all right im picking up tiberius stone butt and continuing  matt okay you guys push through the open hole that keyleth pushed in sweat dripping down your  faces as the heat proximity to you is nighintolerable you make your way out of the  gate and now you have that giant magma flow  laura oh right is the thing not wasnt there  matt no no as you guys 
none	 go and step out the doorway that opened up previously is what parted  the magma flow you pulled it open so now its just a wall of magma in front of you  laura she also had created a wall barrier  marisha i did create a wall over top  matt you did its not there anymore  marisha it was permanent  matt it was permanent but a perpetual flow of magma on it for a period of a few hours will  eventually eat through a stone wall  laura can you cast it again  
none	 marisha i can yeah do it again bam  matt okay its probably the last of that you create a stone wall that juts out once again  blocking off the magma flow you guys all step out of the room just as the main force of magma begins  to fill the room behind you everyone make one more dexterity check to get out in time as its a  small space and youre pushing out  sam natural 20  orion 16  matt you made nothing  marisha you made nothing seven  taliesin ten  ashley

none	 matt as youre pushing through vax you fall unconscious as the magma is currently lapping at  the back of your leg the rest of you begin pushing out as you begin to realize that your  halfelf friend is currently melting in a pool of magma  ashley can i grab him can i grab him out  matt go ahead and make a strength check this is strength at this point this is pure adrenaline  pushing through  ashley 12  matt 12 you manage to start pulling him up through the hole that keyleth made  
none	 taliesin im going to assist im pulling out im doing another ice shot to try and cool off the  magma around him  laura i send trinket up to like pull him  matt before you get to that point as youre readying for it cause its a small space as  youre pulling it giant bear claws come over and latch onto the back of vaxs armor the grizzly  bear begins to tense pulling back makes a strength check thatll do it both of you manage  to pull you out you take an additional bit of 
none	 heat damage you are now at two failed saving  throws two failed death saving throws  liam i am a centimeter away from real death  matt as he pulls it out you can see most of his foot is melted and his right leg  sam aw thats his best leg  taliesin i pull a level two healing potion just get it in his mouth  matt okay you pull it out at this point the magmas beginning to fill up the room  by the way  marisha okay wait wait wait can i take my
