town	 terrible  scenario occur an older man who was at the carnival had been transformed in the middle of a  performance into some horrible undead creature that attacked and assaulted other people within  the tent you defeated it and since have all been under investigation and been told you cant leave  the town to try and absolve yourselves of any sort of doubt youve begun to investigate what  the cause is for this strange transformation youve gone around the town asking questions  meeting individuals eventually finding yourselves back at the tent in the middle of 
town	 the night past  midnight in the early hours of the morning sneaking into tents and asking members of the  carnival what they may know about what has transpired upon speaking with a number of members  of the carnival two of the guards that were on site suddenly fell dead where they were standing  writhing in pain as they passed you watched as a large shadow which you had confirmed being  fiendish in nature leapt northward towards the ustaloch and out of sight as both fjord and caleb  rushed out of the main tent to 
none	 see the center of the camp where these two bodies begin to rise up  two more of the freshly transformed undead creatures now angered and looking about for  something to feast upon and that was where we left off  travis totally good  sam no problem with our setup  laura that was the third spell by the way detect good and evil  matt okay there you go so how many spells do you have left  laura no spells ive got cantrips though so dont worry guys  matt well  taliesin no burger left 
none	 just onion rings  laura just the fried piece not even an onion left in there  matt i would like you all to roll initiative please  travis oh right off the bat  matt yeah  sam were fighting already  marisha oh natural 20  sam nope  i rolled her dice it was a one im never rolling it again  laura oh yours rolled a one too  laughter  travis we rolled low level two  laura oh no oh no  matt all righty 20 to 15  marisha 24  matt beau 
none	 at the top 15 to 10  liam elf 11  sam is that german  liam ja  matt ten to five  sam five  taliesin eight thats a number  matt that it is you  travis nope three  liam three  laura you have three initiative whats your initiative  liam whats your modifier  travis zero  matt so five  liam holy shit  matt the good news is they didnt roll very high either but still better than a lot of you and  then three and three  laura no im 
town	 four  matt okay there we go  travis youre one right  sam i have five one plus four  liam and youre one plus nothing  laura one plus three  matt you watch as these two zombified guards their brasscolored scale armor clanking as their  forms rise up looking around peer past the shadowed darkness around the campfire lighting the  interior the horses grow nervous as you watch both caleb and fjord emerge from the tent right in  their sights you watch as they both  begin to lumber in your direction  travis 
town	 son of a bitch  sam you guys are out in the open  laura yeah theyre just sitting there  liam we just walked out of the tent door and are looking at that  travis thank god theres that cart right there  liam were safe  matt they come right up to you  laura they are fast moving zombies  matt well thats all it can do it dashed it lurches towards them they move a little bit  quicker than youd expect but not necessarily that quick they both spend their full turns  trying 
none	 to close the gap for the horses  liam is that one five or ten feet away from me  the horses immediately freak out  and start running this direction in a gallop  liam oh damn it  travis there goes that idea  taliesin it was such a good idea  sam the horses have better initiative than all of us  matt thats going to go ahead and end their go beau youre up  marisha i turn to jester and molly fucking we probably shouldnt kill crownsguard even if its  a zombie should we 
town	 go after the toad  laura we should probably kill the zombies because anybody that gets bitten by a zombie turns into  another zombie  marisha i dont want to be a guard killer all right fine  taliesin i dont want to be a fucking zombie  travis we just cant be here  marisha can i peek out and see the guardzombies  taliesin they did run by  matt you watch them as you peek under the tent and they both just ran to the right  marisha can i crawl out from under the tent 
none	 and clear the gap with them and get up to them  taliesin oh fancy  sam cool map  matt thats as close as you can get right there you can go into a dash if you wanted to engage  directly  marisha oh man i dont know what to do  travis its all right work it out  matt actually this is my fault i rolled for the zombies to see who they saw first but technically  their turn hadnt come up yet thats my fault because their initiative is lower in the order so 
town	  were going to retcon a little bit of that thats still there  travis singing rewind  matt because your initiative was super high thats totally my bad its early enough in the  combat where its not going to make a huge difference but you do watch as they turn and they  look past the direction like theyre ready to dart towards the actual large carnival tent  laura now i just want to do hamilton with all our character voices  marisha after jester trying to help me can i close the gap to this guy 
none	  matt you can at this point yeah its two squares to get there  travis look at that mini  laura oh youre out there all by yourself beau  marisha its cool man  travis cut them down with those guns  marisha is that fire still going  matt its not a huge blaze but theres some flames in it its starting to burn out a little  bit  travis both barrels six shooter give it to them  marisha okay with my initial attack as i run up can i take my staff and try 
none	 and take them out at  the knees just a sweep  matt sure id say go ahead and make an athletics check  travis knock them prone  marisha yeah thats what im going for  matt make an athletics check  travis i like that a lot  marisha thats not great nine  matt rolled a natural 20 on his end  marisha shit  matt as you swing with the staff it slams into the side of the guards leg and you hear the  slight crack of wood as the armored exterior of the zombified 
none	 form seems to stand resolute against  the strength of your blow its head which was turned off angrily towards the shadowed direction  of caleb and fjord turns back the red burning coals for eyes now glaring in your direction what  are you doing  marisha i look at him and i say you fucking broke my stick im going to do an elbow to the  face and then another punch with the staff still in my hand and do flurry of blows  matt well you did your one attack to sweep him its an unarmed 
none	 attack for your next two  marisha right i know im doing an elbow and a punch im just holding my staff  matt right misunderstood okay go for it roll for the attack  marisha two attacks right  matt you got it  marisha oh god this makes me so nervous thats good 19 for the first one  matt 19 hits  marisha oh and a natural one for the second  matt you guys with the ones at the start of this fight  laura i dont know whats happening  matt roll damage for the 
none	 first one  travis you cant be too cocky  matt i know apparently  marisha eight  laura whats new at the table  taliesin everything  matt eight points of damage as you elbow across wham you watch as the jaw hangs and dislodges a  bit and as its head turns towards you you reach with your other first and it catches it in the  middle of the air and it tries to bite at your arm but the jaw hangs open not able to actually  find any purchase in your arm i believe that 
none	 ends your turn caleb youre up  liam i am going to move over a bit towards that carriage and i pull the diamond out of my  component pouch and a small prismatic ball forms over it i take my other hand and spin it really  fast and little ice shards start shooting out of the side i take it with the free hand and im  going to throw it like a fucking baseball pitcher at the one closest to beauregard  matt right there okay so go ahead and roll your attack on that  liam 
none	 dd beyond where did you go oh thats good 23  matt 23 definitely hits  liam okay so that is cold damage 3d8 come on nine total  matt nine points of cold damage to it you watch as its trying to bite with no effect towards  beaus arm as shes pulling away the sphere slams into the side of its shoulder it would be this  side and it pulls back you watch as the arm breaks a bit and the ice shards coalesce around  the outside of the armor and linger with this frost and 
town	 mist that sprays off the impact it  looks fairly damaged  liam question am i supposed to roll initiative for frumpkin as well  matt technically by the rules yes but it might be easier to have you guys go at the same time  liam okay if thats what you want to do  matt sure for now  liam im sending frumpkin to zip under that tent he has 40 feet of movement  matt this one here  liam yeah  matt easy enough frumpkin is underneath there  travis whats inside  marisha whats in 
town	 the tent  travis sneezing fucking cat  matt that your turn  liam thats it ja  laura this is so cute look at all the little barrels  matt molly youre up  taliesin im going to burst out of the tent can i make it to the one that beau is fighting  matt counting you can indeed  taliesin im going to make it to the one that beau is fighting and im going to take two  straight attacks with my scimitar  matt go for it you see half of its body encased in 
none	 ice now and its still lashing out in beaus  direction as you rush up  taliesin thats a 15 and a natural 20  matt okay then  taliesin without even figuring out yeah  laura fifteen plus whatever  matt those both hit  taliesin natural 20 is just double the die right  matt yeah  travis come on iron snitch  laura make up for our shortcomings taliesin  matt which ones which  taliesin first one is counting 15  travis yeah dude  taliesin no double i have to roll two dice right  
town	 matt the first attack is that die so thats not the critical  taliesin okay thats fine thats nine points of damage then two dice or double the dice  matt well just double the die its fine its fun to do it that way less dice to have to roll  taliesin thats 13 points of damage  matt 13 points of damage  matt ha nope so you watch as its slashing at beau the ice explodes in its side and mollymauk  comes walking out of the tent both of the scimitars spinning in his hand like 
none	 this dervish  entity as he slams both blades simultaneously into the sides of this creature he cuts a v shape  into the upper torso and it slips out of it the central portion of its body slips onto the ground  with a splat and the arms fall to the side and the body collapses onto the ground  taliesin i turn and smile at beau  marisha thanks  laura you cut like a little v cake with head  taliesin its a pizza pie with a pizza slice i turn 180 and get ready for the 
town	 other one  marisha doesnt make me trust you any more less actually  matt which is now its turn having you rush out of the tent its attention once in the distance  it traces you over as you attack its ally it lunges over towards you and makes two strikes in  your direction  taliesin i make eye contact with it and fuck it just for fun im going to burn my blood maledict  theres going to be a blood vessel that pops on my neck and im going to make him cry  travis im 
none	 just going to make him cry  matt the bulging red eyes suddenly go black and thick droplets of bloodlike ichor begin to spill  out the corners of the zombies eyes  taliesin i take three damage  matt oh are you  taliesin im amplifying  matt you take three damage this attack and the next attack he has disadvantage on  marisha ooh shit thats awesome  matt 16 and an eight for the first attack so that bring it down to a 12 to hit  taliesin no  matt as it rushes towards you you 
none	 can see the opening as it swings too wide and you duck right  out of the way second attack with disadvantage as well thats a 19 and a 16 so the 16 plus four  thats 20 so it still hits  taliesin it still hits thats fine  matt the first one you duck out of the way however the secondary slam hits you for five  points of bludgeoning damage across your shoulder you get pushed back into beau and beau catches  your fall  travis not the jacket  taliesin ow  matt that ends 
town	 its go nott youre up  sam its still alive  matt yeah  sam nott is going to hard charge out of the tent not at the beast but across the courtyard yes  as fast as she can go saying shit shit shit can she make it to that box  matt she cant unfortunately  sam she cant  matt no its counting you can get to right there  sam as shes running shes going to fire her crossbow at the dude 11 plus six 17  matt that hits  all ooh  laughter  
none	 travis wow  your dice just ollied off of the side of your dice tray if this was tony hawk you would  be accumulating points still its racking it up  liam ive seen this twilight episode he knows what is behind your screen the rest of the game  marisha give him the multiplier  matt there you go  sam okay so that is seven points of damage and sneak attack damage  matt correct as it is adjacent to molly  sam another two points  matt okay  sam oh and why not ill use 
none	 fury of the small add another two points  matt thats a full ten points of damage to him  sam yes and then bonus action can i just hide behind that thing  matt you cant hide behind it because youd have to get behind it but you can use your bonus  action to dash and get behind it youre not technically hiding but youll move in this direction  laura oh thats what rouges can do they can use their bonus action to dash  sam apparently  matt yep you get behind oh god that finishes 
town	 your turn nott that brings us to jester youre up  laura oh okay im going to sit down on the ground and open the tent  matt and look out  laura and look out  matt you see this sudden interaction of everyone or at least beau and molly leaping towards the  standing zombie  laura then i say oh shit i shouldnt have used all those spells earlier all i have is sacred  flame and im going to do that im going to shoot sacred flame and at the same time im going  to 
none	 go frumpkin come here let me pet you  matt all right so sacred flame is a saving throw for the  laura yeah its a 13 dexterity  matt it actually rolled exactly a 13 with no modifiers so it does succeed  laura that doesnt do any damage then  matt well what does it say on the spell is it half damage or no damage  laura it just says thats it  matt okay then yeah sorry  laura balls coughs shit frumpkin lumpy come here  matt let me double check that  laura sorry 
dung	 guys  matt that finishes jesters turn fjord youre up  travis oh yeah can i fucking run up past the cart charge into the fray with my 30 speed  matt thats about as close as you can get right there  travis can i pull out my falchion ill flip it over so its pommel up and i will use eldritch  blast towards the remaining zombie  matt as you hold your arm out in force the edge of the pommel glows with this dark black purple  crackling energy and this single bolt of eldritch energy 
none	 fires out in the direction roll for the attack  travis that is a 14  matt that hits roll damage  sam travis is using magic  travis im telling you its all happening you guys that is nine points of damage  matt nine points of damage nice it hits and the armor dents inward to the point where if it was  still a living human it probably wouldve caused some serious internal bleeding or bludgeoning but  the creature seems relatively unphased by the impact other than being pushed onto one foot then  back on 
none	 its twofoot weight that ends your turn  travis i look around and say we need to drop this fucker and get the hell out of dodge  laughing  taliesin theres no way were going to be able to take this shit seriously  matt beau youre up  marisha okay back to the top im going to do with my twohanded im going to use my  quarterstaff twohanded and come down and try and crack it over his head  matt all right you have to move over to him though  marisha okay can i step 
none	 over the dead guy sorry excuse me  matt you vault off of the corpse of the other zombie guard and then leap down with your staff  towards him go for it  marisha goddamn it fuck balls and shit 13  matt 13 still hits  marisha yeah fuck yeah  travis if you werent drinking a sea anemone  marisha youre so weirded out about it 11 points of damage  matt 11 points of damage wham you slam into it and watch as it impact its starting to look  pretty beat up but its still 
none	 standing  travis damn that armors helping it huh  matt you have a bonus action if you still want it  marisha i can hit again with my bonus right im still trying to figure this out  matt every turn as long as youre attacking with your action you can bonus attack with you unarmed  strike then use a ki point to double attack if you want  marisha right learning these combat abilities its weird okay im going to be like ugh die  im going to do a big roundhouse kick to his head

town	 taliesin undead strength  matt renewed in the sense that for a second you watched the light flicker out but it seems to push  through by the force of the enchantment that holds it aloft  marisha beau goes who undid my work  liam i probably have a little bit of movement left  matt youve got ten feet  liam i would like to sidle into the tent that i exited before and disappear frumpkin will dart  across behind molly to the little tent  laura no dont leave me  matt counting whats the movement

none	 go ahead and roll damage  taliesin thats nine points of damage  matt nine points of damage  as the blade sinks into its shoulder and you see it carves in and jams halfway through the  torso the armor stopping it part way before it lodges in and it leans forward growling its  still standing and your blades stuck in the abdomen  laura renewed undead strength  matt all right that ends your turn molly its going to take its first slam swipe at you since  youre immediately in front of it thats a natural 
none	 20 im rolling some good 20s tonight  travis what dice did you use  matt what other dice of course its the snitch  travis screaming no look what you did  come back to bite you in the anus  taliesin this is not looking good this is looking very bad  matt 11 points of bludgeoning damage  taliesin oh my god  matt it clocks you across the side of the temple youre vision goes blurring for a  second you spit across the ground youre used to the sight of your own blood but now 
none	 its across  the grass and dirt at your foot you start to feel yourself get a bit woozy its going to go ahead  and spin around and strike you with its open claw with the other arm  taliesin i swear i thought i could kill it  matt thats going to be a 16 to hit  taliesin that hits  sam man down  travis come on baby  matt that is nine points of bludgeoning damage  taliesin oh yeah im out  travis laughing yeah first one  marisha oh shit christ  travis 
none	 write the history books  matt you guys watch as the first hit clocks molly hard the second one is this clawing uppercut he  goes backwards dropping one scimitar the other one being left stuck in the body of the undead  guard as it now glances back towards beau to its right thats the end of mollys turn and the  zombies turn nott youre up  laura kill it nott  travis you didnt fall into the fire right  matt no he fell straight back  travis are you sure  matt if he rolled a 
none	 one wed talk  taliesin i think im immune to fire anyways or some such thing  matt fire resistance  taliesin yeah fire resistance  travis because of your magical technicolor dreamcoat  matt nott what do you got you just watched molly go down  taliesin out but not dead  sam seeing one of us die scares the shit out of me  matt unconscious  sam no dead forever  laughter  taliesin ive just started working on a new character tonight thank god  sam i start charging out at the beast  matt all 
none	 right  sam i get about halfway i fire my crossbow wailing scream  fire the crossbow  travis so brave  sam thats a natural 20  cheering  laura with sneak attack you double your dice  matt how do you want to do this  cheering  matt it doesnt even matter the damage you deal if the damage from a critical hit it doesnt get  its undead fortitude  cheering  sam im low to the ground so probably in the back of the calf or something before it falls im  going to turn 
town	 and run into the tent i dont even know if i hit screaming  liam thats my girl  matt molly as you watch it turn around towards you suddenly it lurches as a crossbow bolt  shatters its kneecap from behind its other leg which had been partially damaged from the process  of getting up and combat thats happened isnt enough to keep it aloft it tumbles back into the  fire and immediately begins to burn as it begins to scream and squeal see the flames begin to burn  and engulf its body before eventually it 
town	 comes to rest no longer held by this undead magic that  keeps it standing quiet falls over the encampment  travis nice  molly well next up as this is now  important jester its your turn  laura i come running out of the tent say molly oh shit oh no okay i kneel down next to him and  ill do spare the dying cantrip  sam its a cantrip  laura yes it took someone going unconscious guys  sam its designed for this moment  matt that being the case you become stable  taliesin 
none	 gasps  matt youre not conscious yet but youre stable you dont have to make  laura can i try and do some medicine on him does that heal him at all  matt do you have a healers kit  laura i dont think so  travis she has desserts  laura i have doughnuts some paint supplies  matt beau as youre standing here molly is no longer bleeding out hes breathing and coughing  in the unconsciousness from the pain you watch as jester is fiddling through her bag pulling things  out  marisha you have 
none	 a six pack of donuts but you dont have a healers kit in there and youre the  cleric im confused  laura im the cleric what is this ive never traveled with a bunch of people that i thought  would die in front of me okay i never needed a healers kit before  marisha well congratulations youre the cleric now  laura gasps you have a healers kit oh my gosh ive always wanted one of these for so  long  marisha ill give it to her here its a gift congratulationsonyoubeinginanew group gift  laura 
none	 yes how do i use this though  sam oh no shes not proficient  laura i open it and rummage through a bunch of shit here  travis no vanilla extract or sprinkles  matt ill say for the instance of this since its not necessarily immediate danger of him dying  off go ahead and make a medicine check  sam use my dice that i gave you  laura should i  sam yes  laura what if i roll a one on it  sam thats what im hoping for  sam thats a strong four 
town	  laura a nine  matt okay ill say sighs hes still unconscious given a little bit of time hell  come back to consciousness ten minutes or so you can probably eventually through the use of strong  vapors or something you can bring him back from the brink at this point the rest of the carnival  currently within the vicinity begin to emerge from the tents seeing that the danger has passed  sam is there any young girl in the tent with me  matt make a perception check  sam natural 20  matt you 
town	 glance around the interior of the chamber which has a unique smell to the inside  you smelled it before but it catches you very strongly now that theres quiet and youre not  focused on anything else a very faint smell of brimstone lingers within the tent mingling with  the wet grass you look around and see no girl  liam what does happen is frumpkin scrabbles up your back and comes to your shoulder and im  watching everything from my hidey hole  marisha i immediately drop down and start searching the guard  laura yeah 
none	 is any of their armor still usable because we can pretend were guards for some  reason  matt the one that he cleaved the armor is not functional at all the other one the last one to  die the armor is still functional it is dented and beat up but its still functional theres  the slightly tarnished brass armor then theres the red maroon color its like a scale mail  chestplate and armplates for it it could be used but its still a big piece of armor youd have to  lug it around or wear 
none	 it  travis we still look like crownsguard  laura oh  matt you both do currently  travis caleb and i  liam we probably have a half hour at this point  matt about yeah  laura we should get out of here soon though because guards could be coming  travis did anybody see what happened or where that hellish toad went  laura it jumped off that way  travis you saw it  laura yeah  matt the knot twins emerge like where are the guards the rest of them are more coming or is 
none	  this all of them  laura theres probably more coming i would think  travis we cant be here  matt do you think we should run  marisha we should hide the evidence  travis what where  marisha i dont know  laura i dont know who should run where  taliesin groans  laura i have his head in my lap and im slapping his cheek consistently  marisha was there nothing useful on the guard  matt as you continue to search through aside from the armor that seems functional each of them  have 
none	 a basic longsword  taliesin one of them has my sword embedded in their chest  matt yes which can be pulled out between the two of them you can gather about six gold pieces  and four silver pieces  laura ooh  travis i dont want to get these folk in any more trouble how far is it from here to the lake  matt glancing off to the side you can see the lake is maybe 400 to 500 feet north  travis i say we could drag them and throw them into the lake to avoid 
none	 suspicion on the carnival  weve got to get out of here  marisha how well did the fire burn the other body did it do pretty well or  matt its pretty burned the maroon robes on the one armor is damaged and can possibly be salvaged  the armor on the one that is burned can be used the robes or the maroon cloth is burned away  entirely the armor looks like its been burned it has blackened charcoal edges to it  liam nott you feel frumpkins claws slowly and deliberately squeeze into your shoulder  
town	 sam that means i have to go  travis wheres caleb  marisha i thought he was with you  travis he was i look around for caleb  matt okay if youre right there youre not far from the tent you head back and see hes not on  the outside of the tent  sam the smell of sulfur i mean brimstone do i figure that its probably the residual from the  big toad guy or is there a substance in the room that is causing it  matt make a religion check  sam a religion

none	  matt no no it is  travis im just very curious as to the sex of the horse thats all  matt roll a perception check  travis 12 no 14  matt that is a mustang  liam is its name roy  sam the white one  travis yeah  taliesin are you going to name it sally  travis youll find out  laughter  taliesin i had that coming  liam during all the busywork im not saying anything but i keep giving worried and stressed  glances at my little friend  laura dont 
none	 worry caleb im okay  matt you guys have the bodies loaded up both the charred and the slashed one onto the cart  taliesin im going to pull my sword back out and start trying to get the horses going  laura hes alive youre awake  taliesin that really hurt  laura how do you feel  taliesin i feel terrible  laura i saved your life you should be really grateful  taliesin i can do that i can do that  marisha molly i appreciate you trying to rally the horses right now but i really 
none	 think you  should rest  taliesin no im fine im going to actually fall back into the cart  marisha i take the reins  matt all right easy enough to find any sort of material if you wanted to cover the contents of  the cart you guys are ready to go ornna is standing there alone i think i should stay here  laura are you sure  matt what and be a fugitive i can explain what happened hopefully  laura what are you going to say to them  matt exactly what happened the same 
none	 thing that turned these guards ran off and youre hoping to  stop it  laura dont say that we were here dont mention we were here thats pretty important i think  yeah  travis you couldnt see us in the low light but they chased after whatever caused this  matt okay i can do that i cant leave gustav and bosun in prison to take the fall for this  laura well get them out of it  liam would you have the abilities to burn these things up the way we did are you capable could 
none	  you have killed these things is that believable for people who know you  matt im quite good with fire thats not entirely impossible  marisha ornna is there anything else that you can think of that could possibly help us like why  this toad decided to freak out right now anything that comes to mind before we go chase after your  mess  travis any previous episodes of this kind  matt no never trusted anything that looked the way kylre did everyone seemed to put a lot of  trust in him gustav did toya 
none	 did i dont know if this is still a misunderstanding but she  points over to where theres splatters of blood in the middle of the grass the leftover carnage from  the battle just get this figured out please this is all i have left she looks around the  empty encampment she stands amongst the four empty tents by herself  sam toyas gone right  matt toyas gone  laura what happened to her did it take toya with it  liam yeah she frogged out  travis well try and find some evidence that will exonerate 
none	 you and well return  laura we need to find evidence to exonerate us  sam sorry that we thought that you did it briefly  matt its okay its hard for some folks to trust carnival folk just as hard as it is for  some folks to trust little green folk  laughter  travis we should really get to stepping  laura lets go  sam saddle up  travis sure  matt you hop on your mustang  travis i do shelby  marisha oh god  travis just deliver it to the po box thats 
none	 fine  taliesin everything that youve been holding back for years now is going to come pouring out of you  okay  matt you have the cart and the horses at your disposal what are you guys doing  taliesin trying to take as much of a short rest as i can back there im going to try and sleep  this off like a bad hangover  liam i will attempt to do the same to do arcane recovery  matt okay the two of you saddle up on the back of the cart as it makes its 
none	 way northward  sam where are we going  travis in the direction the toad leapt  laura are we really chasing the toad right now molly obviously did the most damage out of anyone  and hes almost dead right now  marisha maybe we can at least find him stake him out and then well rest  laura we are going to rest right we cant just chase after a toad well die  travis we might need to play it by ear  laura fjord im trusting you  travis if its too dangerous well stand down 
none	 how about that  laura okay  liam also i have a cat  laura yeah its cute  liam thats not what i mean if we catch up to them my cat can follow and i can watch  travis yeah you blanked out there for a second  liam if we find them then we assign frumpkin to the case and i will lean against a tree nott will  keep watch over me and we will know where it goes  sam were going with them then  laura yeah lets follow the direction that the toad 
none	 went  travis yeah  marisha cats love toads  laura i like it its a good plan this is definitely not going to backfire lets go  laughter  matt all right the horses pick up and begin heading northward towards the ustaloch  laura when we get far away from the carnival we should drop the guard bodies off push them out so  it looks like they were on patrol when they turned into zombies far away from the carnival  marisha we ran into those guards that were patrolling the lake  laura exactly like a 
none	 lake patrol  matt it doesnt take you too long to get to the southern edge of the ustaloch you can see the  muddy lake bed that gives way to the water itself number of scattered stones in the muck and  occasionally you hear the lapping of waves the very subtle wind flowing through in the night  its about two in the morning theres some moonlight in the sky it looks like a waxing moon  at least the one you can see because there are multiple moons  sam wait what  matt theres two moons 
none	 in exandria  sam how did we never know that  matt that was established in the last campaign  taliesin like dogs we never looked up  matt one of the moons is so faint  sam how many suns are there  matt theres one anyway theres a faint bit of moonlight which gives you folks without darkvision  a little bit of detail that you can make out in the vicinity you come to the lake edge and  theres the water  travis this is the best we can do for them  laura take them 
none	 out of this wagon  marisha hang on hang on i want to look around do i see any guards  matt perception check  marisha big dice dont fail natural 20  matt okay couple things one you dont see any guards but you do see a few hundred feet to the  west of you along the edge you see a boat that is about a hundred feet out on the water you see two  figures that are in the boat possibly two fishermen or two guards but you cant really tell  from this distance there 
none	 are two figures in a boat a little ways out on the water  from your current visual perspective you dont see the other end of the  lake its a pretty decent sized lake but you can see the very faint bump of a landmass that breaks  the horizon of the water  marisha like an island  matt like an island possibly  laura or a giant toad sitting in the water  taliesin that would be a very big toad  marisha its far away on the horizon the little bump  matt yeah it breaks 
none	 the waters horizon from here  marisha theres two figures on a boat about a hundred yards out  laura can they see us  marisha i dont know its hard to say do they seem distracted can i make anything else out  travis lamplight on the boat  matt theres a faint bit of lantern light thats the only reason youre able to make them out at  this distance but thats as much detail as you can make out theyre a few hundred feet away from  you  laura if we cant see them very clearly 
none	 they cant see us very clearly we dont have a light  on us  travis were going to have to ditch this wagon anyway because weve got tracks  sam just change the license plate no  travis vanity plate what does it say  sam back in time  laughter  matt oh man  so what do you do  laura go up a little further away from the boat and then dump the bodies  sam its really shallow shouldnt we weigh them down with something  laura its not like were trying to hide the 
none	 bodies were saying they turned into zombies  around here is that stupid  travis no they dont have to go in the water right theyre burned its not like they burned  in the water  matt that would be very confusing  travis it would  taliesin the wagon tracks directly to the point at which they are found  travis thats what i just said  laura oh coming from the carnival  travis i wish i had something that could help molly out  sam we could write a little note and put it in one 
none	 of their pockets that says something like  ive discovered that caleb and nott are innocent and should be cleared of all charges or  something like that  laura that would definitely work will you add my name to that list  sam sure how do you spell jester  laura like normal  sam okay  marisha maybe we can dump them backtrack with the cart and drop the cart back off  travis as weve been riding have we seen any tracks that we think might have belonged to the  toad since it was leaping in 
none	 these huge arcs  matt make a survival check  travis ugh three  matt even with your darkvision its hard to make out too many details theres a lot of foot  traffic along the banks of the river at different points in the day theres not a lot of light  youre unable to pick up any tracks  laura maybe we dump the bodies and ill get out and try to make the tracks go away for a little  bit ill walk up the path and do like this  travis why we could get rid 
tavern	 of the wagon later  laura yeah but the wagon will come from the carnival straight to the bodies isnt that weird  liam youd have to erase the tracks all the way back to the how far back are you willing to go  laura not that far  liam whats the plan here are we going to flee  laura i think we have to go back to the inn right  travis once the sun comes up  liam i know everybodys in deep shit i understand the problem but my question is are we  cutting 
none	 and running  laura yeah  liam no i mean cutting and running  travis no no we cant just leave  laura oh okay  liam we do it all the time  laura well  travis lets see if we can find the toad if the sun starts to break then well make up our mind  laura all right are we dumping these bodies or what  travis yes kick them out  matt okay so you remove the bodies from the cart are you dumping them on the shoreline  laura yeah  matt okay thud 
none	 thud the two transformed guard corpses now lie there one an ashy mess the other  in three pieces left along the bank of the water  laura i get out and i start positioning them like maybe they were having a romantic tryst  liam those two burnt men yes  matt okay laughs  marisha im going to help jester try and clear the tracks while she positions bodies  matt make a survival check  marisha disgusted noise eight  matt all right you guys  laughter  travis anybody else want to look for some toad 
none	 prints  laura do you want us to  sam we were going to go along the north way right  travis weve been doing that already  marisha if we try and cover the wagon tracks as much as we can then follow the embankment and try  and ride the horses and the cart along the water itll hide our tracks as we move northward  laura sure lets do that  marisha okay  taliesin who are you  travis thats actually a great idea  taliesin thats really clever why would you even think that  
none	 laura oh shes all about shady shit she does a lot of it  taliesin huh  marisha you understand  taliesin maybe i dont know ill think about it  laura singsong go to sleep little tiefling  taliesin ow that hurts ow  liam beauregard are the people on the boat doing anything different  matt you glance back over and you can see the boat seems to have moved a little bit further away  and has come up to the bank and looks like its hitting land  marisha towards us  matt no a little 
none	 bit further away and then has hit the land the figures are currently taking  things out of the boat  laura theyre late night fishermen  marisha i think theyre fishermen lets keep moving  matt okay which direction are you moving  marisha north  matt well north is into the water like you hit the water of the bottom of the lake  sam the toad went due north like straight into the water  matt thats the direction it was traveling  laura can i look for toad tracks  matt make a survival check sure 
none	  travis come on dont roll sams fucking dice  laura i didnt  matt oh sam  taliesin that was a lot  laura that was a whole lot of rolls survival 11  matt 11 its hard to really make out what tracks are what you do see a few heavy impacts in the  mud some of them looks like it could have been the bodies being rolled but not too far from  where you are theres one big smack in the mud like something heavy impacted  laura fjord come look at this this is 
none	 definitely toad tracks  travis in the shape that its in this print are their toes pointing in a specific direction  matt make an investigation check  taliesin well this will break my short rest  matt this will break your short rest  travis 14  matt you can see the heavy impact has a few subtler imprints there do appear to be two hands  and two feet though the water has washed in and gotten rid of a lot of the details at this point  you can vaguely tell they appear to be facing towards 
none	 the water  laura that lump is the toad  sam could be  taliesin how many people in the boat  travis two  taliesin how many people are we looking for  travis one and a giant toad  taliesin didnt he leave with a  travis girl  taliesin two people  matt two people in the boat  marisha do these silhouettes look proportionate to each other  matt they look proportionate to each other  travis does one look like gorilla grodd and  matt they both look vaguely humanoid and regular  marisha which 
none	 way did the fisherman go  matt they are a little bit to the west along the bank in the direction of the city the city is  northwest of you currently if you were to continue around the lake  liam because the city is on the lake so were just around the edge of the lake  matt exactly  marisha i think we should keep heading away from the city right  liam it depends on what were going to do  sam if were chasing the toad it seems like we need to find a boat 
none	 and go out into the water  laura so we head towards that boat that hit land  sam steal that boat  laura if we go towards the toad we are going to fight the toad  sam well no we are just going to find the toad you said this were camping and waiting and  resting  liam the other thing we can do but it will take some time need about an hour frumpkin is a cat  but frumpkin does not need to be a cat i could fly him over as well but i 
none	 need time i need about  an hour  sam or swim  taliesin im actively tracking this creature arent i on a certain level  matt i mean if you want to you havent yet decided to  taliesin i hadnt really thought about it its something i can in theory do  laura because you used your blood on it  taliesin no this would also break my short rest wouldnt it  matt actually id say for the points of expediency with the time it has taken you and  have these discussion at the edge its 
none	 pushing 230 like 300 in the morning and both of you have  finished the short rest  taliesin im going to use hunters bane really quickly and look at the track for a second  matt you get your blood maledict and you can use your hit dice if you want  taliesin yeah im going to do both of those  liam i changed my mind i believe i used arcane recovery during the day so forget it  matt yeah its gone  sam you can hit dice it  laura i bet you have a thing 
none	 where you can click it on  taliesin now im at 12 hit points  matt thats better there you go  travis 12  matt better than one  taliesin yay 12 hit points im going to see if i can help with the tracking because im going to  start actively tracking this particular creature  matt make a survival check  taliesin survival check which i have advantage on  matt you have advantage on it because its a feat  liam if i have an hour to do some ritual casting yeah  taliesin 18  
none	 matt looking at the imprint you follow back the direction of the carnival and you can see the path  because it was a beeline toward the ustaloch the best you can tell because the water picks up  theres no trail to pick up in the water looking at the trajectory it was very intently making its  way towards the water either avoiding making any more tracks and making it difficult to follow  taliesin guy went into the water  laura thats what we figured  taliesin do you think hes trying to swim all the way 
none	 to the other side or you think hes just going  around the lake  travis were not lucky enough to have any small boats along the shores that have been beached  matt not near you theres the one that you saw the two fishermen are at right now then further  into the city the docks theres plenty of boats that are tied up and locked  liam at the level two oh sorry go ahead  marisha go ahead  liam its a rules question you go for it  marisha even if we find this thing 
tavern	 if we rest camping out then were not at the tavern  travis yeah we got like four hours until sunrise  sam do any of us know whats beyond like whats on the other side of this lake is it a mountain  laura straight across  matt the other side of the lake from what you know because you were traveling southward towards  it theres no major landmass on the other side of the lake its just open field you notice what  looks to be some sort of a bulge in the landmass in the center 
tavern	 too large to be the toad but it  does seem to break up the water horizon from that vantage point  laura it could have gone to the island  marisha i bet thats exactly where it is  travis how do we feel about the knowledge that its somewhere here in the lake perhaps or the  other side circling back tomorrow at least well avoid suspicion if were at the inn  laura will you be able to keep tracking it after you sleep  taliesin i dont know im not sure maybe could be  matt 
none	 its not like a mental tracking ability its to be able to see details of the specific  type of tracks  taliesin i legitimately do not know how it works sorry  matt just like any other tracking you still need to have things to follow you can read damage in  the forest to see if something barreled through you can follow tracks you can see blood  splatters any sort of thing that can give you an idea of where something went that is of those types of creatures  taliesin do i know what he was 
none	 by the way  laura he was a fiend  matt with the knowledge of it being a fiend go ahead and make a religion check  taliesin and i get advantage on that  matt you do actually  taliesin religion check 15  matt 15 now that theyve mentioned a fiend it seems familiar but the most you can get is  a memory that you dont know where it came from this memory of horrible toadlike  demonic creatures that exist to the far east in xhorhas  thats as much as you can recall but youre 
none	 definitely sitting here now with this memory  that comes to mind going this whole time this  whole time  taliesin this whole time ive been sitting with this  liam rules question caleb is too fucking poor to change frumpkins shape willynilly because its  ten gold pieces worth of charcoal incense and herbs which i dont have so hes a cat for the  foreseeable future  sam do you just need ten gold pieces  liam i need incense herbs and charcoal  taliesin are you saying this out loud  liam no im just talking 
town	 in my accent to you  taliesin listening to this i reach in  ive got some incense  liam do you have charcoal  travis im sure we can find some charcoal  taliesin isnt this impressive enough that i happen to have some incense  liam if we can get back into town somehow  sam were going to go shopping at three in the morning  matt technically elements of that guards body are charcoal now  marisha thats what i was going to say lets go back and raid the fire  taliesin thered also be 
tavern	 a fire inside the inn to be fair charcoal is its not like its hard to get  travis and you two seem to be able to move freely without suspicion  taliesin thats true you can go shopping more  liam i will  taliesin lets go maintain the illusion of innocence for the evening  marisha should we walk the cart off  laura yeah yeah yeah  travis and leave it outside town as were making our way back  maybe give the horse a little spank  on the ass and send it on its way 
none	  marisha see where it goes i like that  travis shall we  laura its open 24 hours  liam that random book about fiends has all the answers about the fiend were chasing lets go  get it  laura yeah you should do that  taliesin xhorhas its a creature from xhorhas im pretty sure i dont know well see  god im remembering something  laura lets go  travis we head back  marisha we go along the lake then off to the edge and then were going to give the horse a slap and 
none	 send  him off past  matt okay so the cart makes its way  the two fishermen you see are in the process  of tying up nets and bags of things and they just stop and watch you guys ride by then go about the  rest of their work you continue with the cart pulling it up toward the southern edge of where the  ustaloch meets trostenwald and you can abandon it there or you said you wanted to send it somewhere  laura i dont think we would have taken the cart past the fishermen 
none	 are we going to do that  travis i thought we were going to head back  to the village to a good distance  liam how much ground did we cover i dont know  matt so what are you doing  travis were taking the cart back to a distance from the city  liam half a mile  travis yeah and then letting the horses run so the sending the track off  matt i see okay  laura i dont think we would have gone right past the fishermen that would be able to identify us 
none	  marisha using the lake to hide tracks  matt okay so you guys head the opposite direction for a little ways after the field all right whos spooking the horses  liam thats your specialty  marisha whack with the stick  matt make an animal handling check  travis please roll bad if there is any  justice in the world  marisha its not great thanks travis thanks six  sam six to hit a horse  marisha correctly hit a horse  laura the horse whimpers you hurt a horse  matt whats your armor class 
none	  marisha 17  matt 17 as soon as you hit it theres a whinny and theres a splitsecond where you watch  its back leg muscle twitch and you duck out of the way just as its back hooves whoosh past your face  taliesin im going to walk over to the horses and theyre trained horses  matt yeah  taliesin im going to go whisper in their ear and give them a little pat  matt make an animal handling check  laura you rolled shit too  taliesin nine  travis horses are our new door 
none	  liam drops a couple of horse apples  taliesin i didnt get advantage on that because i knew the animals did i  matt no you knew the animals but you werent the animal handler  laura i use thaumaturgy and i make the sound of like a predator behind them  matt okay ill give you an animal handling check with advantage because its fun  taliesin im into this  laura okay 13  matt 13 its above a ten guys awesome  all chanting level two  taliesin this is romper room  matt yeah i 
tavern	 know with a crack and a heavy echoing snarling sound in the vicinity both  horses kick up and go into a full gallop sprint away from the direction of you the cart being  dragged behind it they continue to go into the shadow you dont know how long theyre going to go  liam i cast thaumaturgy quacks  matt by the time you guys make it back to the inn  laura those ducks are scary  matt are you guys being careful or are you just walking back  laura were being careful  matt id 
none	 like you all to roll a stealth check please  travis im going to use mask of many faces to make myself look old  taliesin natural 20  sam what was that i dont even know what that was  taliesin look at all that stuff  laura im going to does anybody have shitty stealth  taliesin i cant even see myself with this roll  liam i do but i rolled 12  laura well okay i was going to give anybody advantage but here you go  sam thank you  laura wow that was bad 
tavern	  liam you have advantage right roll again  sam i already rolled once  travis 18 but im also  liam 16  marisha 17  laura 18  taliesin technically my stealth would be 23  sam 11  matt all right thats fine you manage to make it to the nestled nook inn without any prying eyes  seeing too deeply into your movement you get back to your rooms as the very faint distant change of  black night begins to turn to the faintest of blue of morning curling over you guys go to your 
tavern	  respective rooms and you take a rest  laura we should go to sleep  liam im going to dig some charcoal out of the remains of the fire in the common room and then go  to bed  matt okay the owner watches you do that and shes just whatever  liam dont thank me lovely inn good night  matt dont get anything else dirty  liam just going to draw some dicks  matt you guys complete a long rest  travis we made it  sam one day down two days down  laura

none	 shove the book deep into my belt near my dick so she doesnt want to go near it  laura im not afraid of dicks  marisha shes not your sister anymore  liam good point hey now  sam he gets like this when hes studying he gets very focused its best not to disturb him  matt its an interesting book it talks about different forms of fiends and demons and the  hierarchy of the nine hells it talks about myths and stories of devils and demons interfering with  the lives of mortals a lot of 
none	 it is fables a lot of it is warnings and things that parents would  tell to keep their children from wandering in the darkness but it does have little tidbits of  information about different types and they talk about horned devils and they talk about the great  and terrible balor and pit fiend and it seems to be a jumble between both demons and devils  laura can i look over his shoulder the whole time hes reading it  matt sure if he lets you  liam i do not let her i am in a 
none	 corner  travis and its about 230 to 300  matt right now its about three  travis in the next couple hours they said they would call for us  matt yes  sam should we go look for the toad  travis i was going to say did they come to your room as well  laura yeah in a couple hours  marisha should we talk about what were going to say to them do we need to corroborate our stories  travis i mean we tell the truth we did nothing wrong  laura thats right 
tavern	 we were in this inn the whole time  marisha thats true yeah  travis i was thinking that if we get out of there tonight fingers crossed we should probably think  about acquiring some sort of vessel to explore the lake tonight  laura we can definitely steal a boat  marisha we know where a good fishermans boat is  travis or i may be able to arrange free passage on a vessel  marisha what how  travis i have a little knack with you know  laura he was a sailor thats how i met 
none	 him  travis well for a bit  marisha wow thats pretty cool  liam how long was that for  travis few years  laura as soon as caleb looks up i look in his book what is your book about  liam oh this is about grumpkins and periwinkles  laura gasps those are my favorite  liam what is a periwinkle  laura are there drawings of them  liam occasional drawings theres no penises drawn in this book so i dont think youd be  interested  taliesin any toad creatures  matt you do find 
none	 one interesting tidbit of information that piques your interest  sam ooh he has it written down on a thing  taliesin oh the first piece of paper of the game  marisha whats it say  matt if he decides he wants to share its up to him  liam leave me alone im reading  marisha caleb were bored tell us a story  liam i need 20 actual seconds to see what the piece of paper says  taliesin have you read it now whats it say  sam so fjord youre very acquainted with seamen then 
none	 having been on the water for so long  travis sure am yep  marisha have you heard that joke a lot  travis i have it gets funnier every time though i got to say its all in the delivery  laura he laughed at it the first 20 times i said it to him  marisha so wait do you seamen have cloisters in trostenwald  sam are there clusters of seamen around you at all times  travis is it too early in the campaign to walk away and i fucking saunter away  sam and i 
none	 saunter away i mosy away  laughter  matt as fjord slowly walks away from the table not engaging with your comedic advances  liam do i remember people talking about nightmares from the past couple of days not liam  but caleb  matt no you didnt inquire or question  liam okay and i didnt overhear okay  laura what does it say  liam i mean its chockablock with a lot of things most of it probably untrue and stories to  scare your children but there is some sort of demon that is described as being 
none	 fat and rotund  and it talks about i mean this is too coincidental it cant be the thing that were  what are the odds of something being in this book and its what were chasing today but this is  describing some sort of scaled demon that feeds on people in the night when theyre sleeping and it  leaves corrupted undead corpses behind known as husks  laura that is what they look like they look like husks  marisha they did look like husks  travis and we didnt see anybody it fed on  liam 
town	 does this book is it of this town or  matt oh no its a general book about  liam general book could be anywhere  matt anywhere anything it doesnt even mention locations its just this is some lore about  devils and demons  taliesin kylres been around for a while though and this is new right i feel like was there nothing  travis how well did you know kylre  taliesin i mean not that well of everybody the least  liam you havent heard the word nergaliid  taliesin thats a  matt as soon 
none	 as he says that it triggers something in your brain and that thought you had  the other night clicks like thats what it was that was escaping you nergaliid  taliesin i have heard that word before  liam because thats what im talking about here  taliesin oh dear oh why cant i remember it was so long ago  marisha okay so what was mr frogmans diet  travis yeah what did he feast on  taliesin what did he eat  matt he ate what was given to him  taliesin he ate what we had 
none	  matt he seemed like a lizard man from what you knew and experienced he thought it was fine  there was no draw to it  laura you never noticed him eating people before  taliesin i feel like i wouldve taken note of it i dont necessarily know i wouldve commented on  it but i wouldve noted it  laura okay  taliesin and it was not noted  liam once again i have no idea if this is the creature that were in pursuit of but this talks  about it not eating food but siphoning 
none	 the life off of mortal creatures but not to the point of  death or harming them they might not even notice that its happening  taliesin oh no  laura gasps thats what was happening to toya maybe all of you  liam it says that this thing has two types of feeding one is slow and unnoticeable maybe and  one is quick with much pain and anguish  laura does it say anything about it hiding in water  liam no  laura does it say anything about it liking the sound of song  liam it 
none	 does not  laura is it related at all to the periwinkles you were talking about before  taliesin its not possible hes trying to head back to xhorhas is it i said out loud  travis i think we saw both the fast and the slow feeding methods  taliesin kylre was not a talker  laura does it say how to kill it  travis yeah weaknesses vulnerabilities  taliesin stabbing  laura well most fiends are weak to holy damage right  matt make a religion check  taliesin can i also do this im thinking about 
none	 everything i hear  matt sure ill let you roll for it  sam they have a vulnerability to poppyseed muffins  taliesin nine  laura 14  matt you dont get the idea that most devils or demons have a vulnerability to radiant or holy  damage some might some dont but youre unable to take a bead on this the book you have  is informative from an encyclopedia standpoint its sort of storytelling and an informative  thing but its not a catalog about all the aspects and details of each creature  liam right its a 
none	 kids encyclopedia britannica and scanning through i saw one thing that popped out  matt yeah you were like wait  liam may i ask with my intelligence score of 18 and the keen mind feat could we say that caleb is  a speed reader  matt in comparison to some maybe youre not johnny fivestyle i know kungfu  liam believably not magic  matt yeah you can read pretty quick lets say you spend a lot of time by yourself reading  laura reading  liam good times  travis in the bathroom  taliesin clusters of 
none	 semen all around you  liam it was still funny when it was just implied you can paint it across the wall  taliesin always funny always  liam were talking about masturbation  sam jerking off  laughter  liam would you say that caleb is a speedbeater  sam roll for spanking  matt from the window to the wall  laughter and groaning  matt as you guys are having this discussion the two guards that had come in earlier come through  the main door earlier than the three hours you had anticipated with another guard 
tavern	 in tow as they  rush in they glance around the room and see you and make a beeline to your table in a very huffed  bit of energy they say you are absolved of meeting this afternoon well pick this up  tomorrow  laura whats going on  taliesin wait what  matt there have been a series of murders within the crownsguard that we are investigating as well  this will be part of the investigation tomorrow you are not to leave this inn  laura but we could help obviously we had nothing to do 
tavern	 with it if people are hurt outside and we were  here the whole time  marisha how are we absolved yet we still have to be locked in this inn  matt you are absolved of it today were still going to come by tomorrow and have you questioned  weve arrested ornna and we have members of the carnival that have fled that were currently  seeking at the moment  marisha you should pick better words next time that are slightly more clear  matt well return tomorrow they leave in a frustrated huff  travis well 
none	 our day just got freed up  sam but they still said we couldnt leave  taliesin you could read that other book at the very least  liam i could i could also heres the thing about my cat hes a cat definitely a cat but is  also a fey creature if i have an hour he doesnt have to be a cat he can temporarily be a bird  laura how much did you say it costs though  liam well i have a lot of charcoal now and you said you have incense on you  
none	 taliesin i go into my bag and ive got some old weird ive got a weird little  matt youve got about eight silvers worth of incense and thats a lot  taliesin its in a very strange ornate bag thats covered in strange gems and weird filigree  sam does molly always smell of patchouli  taliesin sandalwood its nag champa all over  matt its masking the faint scent of horse dung  sam what else do you need  liam let it all out go for it dont hold back  travis are you sure you want 
none	 to do this with your cat  liam yes i prefer him as a cat to be honest but in a pinch  travis anything else besides a bird i mean any kind of creature  liam well not any kind of creature but ive made him an octopus once there was this one time when  nott was very high up in a burning building and we had no way to get her down  sam i jumped on to the octopus and it served as some sort of a landing pad it killed the octopus  but i 
none	 lived  laura octopuses are very smart  liam i think its octopi  laura i didnt say i was very smart  taliesin enough about the pastries already  travis it can be killed is an important thing to know i only mean if its important to you  in a moment of danger i would try to save it but if thats not important  liam it can be pricey to keep bringing him back and all that but he no you cant kill him  travis fair enough thats very impressive  sam ive tried  liam 
tavern	 shes eaten him twice  sam i was very hungry  liam i will need about an hour of time ill probably  head upstairs do you have a pot i could borrow  matt yorda is currently in the process of sitting down and checking something underneath the bar and  goes im sorry what was that  liam i was hoping you had an iron pot i could borrow for never mind ill use the piss pot  ill borrow this  taliesin yes of course  liam is this enough to juryrig  matt how much is 
none	 the  liam its ten gold  matt no youre going to need to go out and buy some  liam thats why i asked  sam buy some what incense  liam okay this is a joke i need to actually go to the incense store  laura get ten gold worth of incense  liam charcoal and incense yeah  for this plan to work  matt there is the remedy store that youve seen before and that would be the place to have  incense andor herbal type  sam ive been to one of these places 
town	 its called natural remedies herbs and medicinal things its  up the street a bit  liam do you have ten gold  sam maybe  travis i have ten gold  laura youre going through gold very quickly  sam or i could sneak in and grab it for you  laura i could help you  sam that sounds fun  liam were still in trouble with the law i dont want to push that if we have the gold thats the  safest path  taliesin im in for a penny im going to throw a gold 
none	 in there as well  matt all right so you have ten gold between you nine from fjord and one from molly  laura okay ill put one in then you have only eight  matt okay so eight off all right you have the gold well say for the purposes of expediency  its easy enough to go and purchase the necessary incense and its quite a bit for the purposes of  this ritual which youve done before its quite a cluster you have to assemble for this the  chalks amassed the other materials you need for 
dung	 it  taliesin i just saw jester open her purse dear  liam brain wipe im going to go up to my room and it takes me an hour to do this an hour and ten minutes to  be exact i put the  taliesin the ten minutes is cleanup  laughter  liam look at the dungeon master is that maybe the longest facepalm  matt i dont know you guys have made me facepalm pretty long before  liam i go upstairs to cast find familiar  marisha oh you found him  matt what form  
none	 liam a sparrow  matt as you finish the concentration the cat form shimmers and condenses into this tiny little  cluster of coal before it sprouts wings and you glance on your shoulder whistles  liam im sorry i know this is not your preferred form but it is only temporary until i get ten  more gold lets go down and get some breakfast  matt you guys after waiting patiently and talking amongst yourselves caleb reemerges with a  tiny sparrow  liam there he is he lands on mollys horn  laura damn it right here 
none	  liam on his horn yes  taliesin go ahead  laura this is the lumpiest little bird ive ever seen  marisha is his name still frumpkin its just a bird now  liam always frumpkin yeah  taliesin hes a little feathery frumpkin  liam he flits over to jesters horn takes a dump  laura i feel so special and blessed you guys  taliesin you look like a princess  laura thank you  liam he stays there for the time being is this what were doing i cant go anywhere im going  to be 
tavern	 blind and deaf i have to stay still and safe try not hit me in the head with too many  things itll take a while but he will go off  travis well if youd like you could stay at the inn or we could acquire that boat and once youre  on board we could send it out as a sort of a recon  liam thats true as well  sam do sparrows see in the dark theyre daytime birds  travis it is daytime right now it would require us leaving now  sam we should 
none	 do this quickly before the light goes away right  taliesin well if we can send the sparrow out we can carry him with us if he finds anything  liam i could have done a bat but its too late for that now  travis a what  liam a bat  travis we should take advantage of the daytime out the windows as we did before  taliesin lets let the sparrow see if it can find anything then we know which direction we have to  head into so theres not too much meandering about  marisha 
none	 yeah can we hunker down here while  taliesin until theres a direction to go  travis perhaps we should go upstairs  matt you can only see through frumpkins eyes for up to a 100foot radius  liam i thought we talked about this you told me and if you need to change it change it but  that i can only control him telepathically up to 100 feet but could continue to see  matt let me doublecheck  liam im happy whatever your ruling is but thats how weve done it  matt i have to recall 
none	 the specifics i may have confused  travis if thats the case well get the boat if not well let drone sparrow activate  liam thats what i based this whole plan on  laura do we have to get in disguise again in order to leave  travis we could try to go out the side of the windows it is daytime  liam the wording was a little squirrely  matt the wording is a little squirrely yeah you cannot communicate with it telepathically but you  could technically still see through its eyes i suppose  liam 
none	 so i can give him the command up close to go but if anything happens i cant improvise with  him he does what the command is  matt right whats the command  liam to fly north to the island and circle it a few times to see what we can see and come back  matt all right as you go up to the window and release frumpkin  travis can we say were doing this from one of our rooms  liam we gather in fjord and mollys room  matt its curious when caleb is focusing 
none	 the pupils go to a very faint sky blue you see  flickering in them though you cannot make any imagery out of it its just the strange movement  within the pupil  travis yep theres that bullshit again  laura he cant communicate with us when hes like this  travis he talks he will talk to you out of the fucking blue  laura can he feel if we touch him i poke him in the forehead  liam ow  laura oh okay  liam dont do that please im trying to concentrate  laura can 
none	 he tell who did it  sam no he cant see you  laura thats wonderful  sam but i will tell him later when he asks  laura well okay but he wont know now  matt as you concentrate the birdseye view of trostenwald frumpkin carries up high into the  air for the large lake that it is you can see two smaller land masses in the center of the lake  technically not north from where you are now since youre back in the city its more of a  northeastern direction theyre both relatively small 
none	 ones maybe a few hundred feet across  another one is maybe 50 feet across its a smaller mass watching as it coasts downward and  does a pass over the larger one make a perception check for frumpkin  liam that is a six plus very little or nothing so you can guesstimate  matt there is a faint treeline on this island the island has a few small trees which is mainly  what you had seen during the night when you looked out over the water beauregard the land mass was  actually the very top of 
none	 this tree line its a small grove that has clustered there on the center  of this island unable to make out any other details other than the tops of these trees and  theres a few spots in between where you can see overgrown grass and general ground rock  liam this is the bigger one  matt the bigger one yeah make a perception check for the smaller one  liam worse five  matt the other one has maybe five or six trees on it but most of them appear to have either died or  be 
none	 standing alone on this small mass that one looks pretty barren even with as bad of a look as  that was it doesnt look like theres anything visible on that land mass  liam does it look balder than the other  matt it does  liam okay  matt the larger one has much more of a cluster a grove  liam last question i can probably tell how far apart these two islands are yeah  matt yeah theyre roughly 600 feet apart from each other  liam 600 okay  sam were all sitting around in 
none	 this room watching him watch tv essentially  matt yes basically  sam while this is going on can i whip out my little chemistry kit and start putting together  some chemical stuff  matt sure what would you like to make  sam acid  matt okay it requires half a day to make that  sam ill start it then  matt okay  sam get in an hour of work  matt okay  marisha while shes doing that im going to  take my staff and repair where it cracked  matt thats easy enough 
none	  laura im going to braid calebs hair  matt okay  liam i feel that  laura i know  liam and it feels good  sam we talking just one braid french braid  laura like a few little braids because his hair is not super long maybe one here one here and  one down here  liam you cant make me vax again it wont work  matt make an intelligence check adding your proficiency modifier  sam one  laughter  travis you kill us all  taliesin playdoh weve got playdoh  matt for 
none	 the supplies that youve spent youve used your one set of acid supplies you had on you  so youll have to buy more to make it again as you begin to make it it becomes caustic and  begins to melt through part of your glove you immediately freak out you drop it and it hits  the wood splatters a bit and begins to melt through the wood  sam sorry i didnt mean to i was  laura gasps now we can spy on the people below us  sam it didnt go through the entire floor 
none	 i dont think  taliesin well were not going to get our deposit back  sam well move the nightstand over a little to cover it up no one will see  marisha is it slowly eating through the wood  matt it is still slowly eating through the wood  sam i pour some water on it  marisha oh no  taliesin that makes it worse  sam oh no  matt eventually frumpkin begins to return having done frumpkins full watch  liam when i see that hes halfway back i come out of it  matt 
none	 you come out of it and the first thing you see is all of them gathered around this hole in  the wood  liam what are you doing  sam im sorry im sorry caleb  liam i plant my hands on the sides of the wood and start transmuting it to iron  laura iron thats not noticeable  matt as you concentrate the area and the wood around where that hole is all of a sudden begins to  turn darker and more solid while the texture remains of wood suddenly it has the appearance of  
none	 a dull reddishbrown metal  sam thank you well mop it up with some towels and whatnot while its still iron  liam hopefully it will dry  travis that is a hell of a talent you have  taliesin its pretty fancy  marisha is that what you did with the coin is this the coin trick  sam no the coin was magic it was a magic pot that we sold you  laura oh man ive been concentrating on skinkydoodles all day  sam that is your power word  laura man all right  sam sorry 
none	  laura its fine  marisha and sam sorry  liam but it brought us closer together  sam would you like back the two copper pieces you gave me for the pot  laura no you keep it im a very generous person  travis can we ask what you saw  liam of course sorry acid wood there are two islands out there a bigger one theyre not  close and a smaller one one is baldish a couple of trees but i couldnt see too well on  either of them the bigger one is dense with 
none	 trees i didnt see them  laura did you have it fly down closer so you could see better  liam i thought that he would be able to see from the air and i thought that would be safer  so no im sorry  travis was it busy water was there lots of ships out  liam i would have seen that  matt there are some fishing vessels out there and there are a number of them that are still at  the docks  travis its not a lull for any reason  matt no  
none	 liam its not fleet week  laura i guess we should go to the big island  liam i think that the chances of finding it on the big island are greater yes  travis fair enough out the window shall we  marisha what time of day is it  matt by now its 330 in the afternoon four oclock  laura should we wait until duskytime  marisha thats what im thinking wait until the sun starts to go down because its got to be  soon at this point  matt actually its probably closer to five 
none	 at the time that youve spent with frumpkin so its  starting to get closer to dusk  laura okay does anybody else want braids in the amount of time we have to wait  marisha ooh yeah can you give me one going back this way  laura of course i can totally do that  marisha thanks  travis is anyone else going to be heading out the front door besides caleb nott and myself  laura i dont want to waste a spell this time  travis i think thats smart  taliesin ill keep with you 
none	  liam how far away roughly was the edge of the lake and islands from where we are right now  matt from where you are right now id say a mile and a half  liam okay so while everyone is preparing i take out my spool of silver thread and i go first to  jesters room and i stretch the thread across and a little magic flitter sound flashes across  and the thread disappears it takes about ten minutes each time and i do the same on fjords  doorway stretch across magic flitter sound if 
none	 anyone goes in to these doors besides you i will  know but not when were on that island only on the way there lasts about a mile  laura thats awesome  travis thats great yeah  marisha while were getting ready molly i dont know if you unintentionally dodged the question  last time or if you didnt hear me but you never exactly told us how the circus creates and writes  their performance acts  taliesin id forgotten about that  marisha oh so you did hear me though  taliesin we were in the middle 
none	 of things  marisha just clarifying  taliesin its usually gustav if somebodys got an act they show it off gustav figures out how  its going to work into the narrative puts it all together  marisha you bring your own narrative  taliesin you bring a bit and then the bit is shaped and formed by the director of the show if  you can do a thing with fire or you can do some juggling and then they figure out how thats  going to work into everything where it sits and what costuming and the whole 
none	 thing is all an act  mostly mostly an act  marisha did toya and kylre come together with their act  laura they came separate  marisha they came separate  taliesin oh youre thinking of toya and kylre they were an act before they were an act for as  long as i can remember right  matt as long as you can remember yeah  taliesin yeah ive never not known them as an act  laura i thought when we talked to them they said that toya came after kylre they joined the circus  at 
none	 separate times  marisha thats what they told you  sam when we were investigating we were  laura we gave them a hard what was it  sam bad cop  laura yeah good cop i was the good cop  sam i was the bad cop  laura yeah and we got hard information from them  sam youre not leaving here without telling us the truth  laura yeah and i was like dont worry she wont hurt you  sam im crazy ill bite her too  laura then they fessed up to everything they were 
none	 like were a fiend and she was like  im a little girl  sam yeah it was crazy  laura that was how it went  sam she confessed to being a little girl  liam do you have any empty positions at the circus for these two  taliesin im feeling like maybe that might be a thing  liam tealeaf you said its mostly an act whats the notmostly part  taliesin well i mean everyones got some weird were weird people people come in and youre a  bit strange you got something you can do 
none	  liam are they all swashbuckling swordsmen like you  taliesin no  laura can they all tell fortunes like you  taliesin no  sam do they cut themselves like you  taliesin well thats a complicated conversation but no  marisha you guys are super easy to lie to no offense or anything they lied to them which means  laura no they didnt lie to us  sam we meted out the truth  laura they told us the truth  sam we cracked the case wide open  taliesin she is a little girl to be 
none	 fair  liam nott  sam toya unless and heres my new theory the big frog man can leech the life force from people  liam if thats what it is yeah  sam what if toya is a fullygrown adult woman but hes been slowly leeching so much life from  her that shes a small husk  taliesin toyas not a fullygrown adult woman  sam shes a tiny fullgrown person  taliesin shes a dwarf  sam oh shes just a dwarf oh okay that makes more sense actually when you say it that way it  
none	 seemed like she was shrunken down from magic  taliesin that is so offensive  liam perhaps this girl toya is his babys bottle and then once in a while he wants an extra snack  taliesin i think youre right but i dont know how hes managed to go this long why now and why  in front of all those people  laura what if hes like one of those creatures that lives on the bottom of the sea and shes not  actually even a person shes like this light thing that dangles in front of  
none	 sam one of his tentacles  laura yeah  travis he has tentacles now  sam not just tentacles dwarf tentacles  liam fucking anime actors  laughter  sam lets go i think we know all we need to know  taliesin i think he is a fiend i think he is feeding off her the rest of it im not sure  marisha you never noticed toya acting weird you were never like oh this is a strange  taliesin have you met us were all a bit weird and you dont ask a ton of questions  
none	 marisha yeah but theres a difference between quirky weird and oh i think this persons life  force is being siphoned away from them weird  taliesin there is its the difference between being in a carnival and not being in a carnival  marisha then why were you with the carnival  taliesin because im weird  marisha groaning  sam that tracks that fully tracks  taliesin i mean its putting together he was never that talkative i dont know i dont like it  liam well what are we doing  marisha lets go find the damn 
tavern	 toad  travis can i use mask of many faces to change into that older grayhaired farmer  matt sure easy enough the sun is close to setting youve got about another 30 minutes  or so before it sets  sam lets go  laura i bless you  sam gesundheit on the way out can i grab some booze from the bar to fill up my platinum flask  or to fill it up a little  matt okay well say for that thatll run you about fine liquor about two silver pieces  sam great ill mark 
tavern	 it down  matt its a hefty flask too  travis using dd beyond  laughter  matt mark that bar tally all right liquor refilled you go towards the window you all  gather and glance out and in the alley below the inn is a stationed crownsguard that wasnt there  before you immediately get the sense that with the sudden murder of two crownsguard being  discovered in the vicinity they may have beefed up security a little bit  marisha ah shit  matt only one of them is guarding the alleys exit onto the main 
town	 street and theyre looking  away at the moment out into the road but occasionally glance over their shoulder into the alley but  there appears to be a little more of a security setup  laura maybe you should go out the front and talk to him and distract him so we can sneak out the window  travis i can do that do you want to come along on this little escapade  liam yes im a good talker when i have to be  sam as am i  taliesin well  liam not for this

tavern	 your way down the alley behind what looks to  be a cluster of empty rain barrels that are set up to catch during storms and you appear to have  managed to just avoid the sight of the guarding crownsguard on the outside of the inn caleb and  nott what are you guys doing  liam were scouting the way nonchalantly i would imagine  sam im real im with you  matt so they darted off into the alley what are you guys doing  liam we could make our way to the outskirts of town

none	 lake itself since the lights have gone out most of  the boats have now come back in and they are bringing in their hauls out and have small nets  and baskets filled with fish theyve caught while theyre out there small crustaceans most of them  are in the process of just offloading and locking up and tying their boats what are you guys doing  liam i think perhaps the best thing to do is to rent a boat not steal a boat  laura you should talk to people  travis i think we may be 
none	 able to avoid any kind of trading of currency  liam whats your idea  travis let me see if i can find a boat that would accommodate all of us and see if we can find some  amicable people  liam all right  travis as a sailor apparently im able to acquire free passage on ships  matt you are actually  travis i have to talk the talk and maybe trade something but  matt one of the larger fishing vessels that can carry a group of your size as  well as a couple of 
none	 others has already been pulled in and most everyone has been loaded off  you can see theres one gentleman in his midforties a little bit of a five oclock shadow  on his chin a small scar across the bottom of it he has a heavy knitted cap thats folded back onto  the top of his shoulders and a long coat and as hes standing there he looks over at you and  watches you approach taking the rope and tying it around the edge  travis hello there i was hoping that perhaps i could trouble you 
none	 were trying to make our way  out into the lake some of my companions and i for a small day trip weve never quite been out  on the lake not this one is there a chance we could trade some work on your days journey for  some travel  matt if youre looking for someone to take you around the lake i could do that for a bit of coin sure  travis im sorry were a bit light on coin is there perhaps anything we could help you with  around here in trade  matt

none	 you can see the bit of moonlight  thats starting to come over the horizon dancing across the upper part of the canopy the trees at  most are about 15 to ten feet tall theyre not incredibly huge some even hovering around the  five to ten foot range on the outskirts  laura how tall was the lizard man devil toad  matt he was about eight feet tall hunched forward  laura okay  liam thats big  matt as you approach the bank you can see already theres a lot of heavy rocks this is not 
none	  a soft muddy embankment like the outskirts of the lake this has a lot of jagged rock and your  shipfinding friend is carefully making his way through as close as he can before he comes to a  stop pushes off with an oar and says all right i think this is as close as i can get what  are you doing here if i might ask  laura we are going to have a picnic on the island  marisha beach party  laura nighttime beach party  matt make a deception check  sam nighttime

none	 see if i see any big broken branches or sign of something big moving  through the forest  matt make a perception check  marisha perception not investigation  matt are you glancing about or are you going to wade through the forest to look for things  liam no ranger  marisha id like to move up to the treeline and see where the mud is and see if i can see any  sign of something big moving through the forest  taliesin or for a witchs hut  matt make an investigation check  laura its 
dung	 a big island  marisha thats the same damn fucking roll piece of shit  matt which is good because the first roll should have stayed anyway works out well  marisha investigation seven  matt seven its hard to tell in the dark unfortunately your human eyes prevent you from  finding any details in the vicinity without a light source the faint bit of moonlight gives you  the general structure of the island but beyond that even looking close you have a hard time  making out details  travis how about we fan out and move 
none	 in  laura okay  travis keep a line within eye shot of each other  marisha like looking for drowned kids  travis well yeah  marisha make a line  liam because i cant see anything im going to hand on your shoulder  sam guide you through  matt okay what is the order in which you guys are walking or fanning out  sam the exact order that our minis are right there  marisha you know it kind of works  travis put me next to beau  taliesin lets put the humans in the 
none	 middle so that they cant be surprised  marisha put fjord on the outside there we go  sam well not the exact order  liam do we want to do it like a vformation with nott in the lead and the two humans just behind  sam were fine like this  laura nott should be next to caleb because he cant see so nott should be right next to caleb  travis jester and nott switch  marisha just dont spread out too far to where were not in shouting distance  laura okay so we spread  
none	 matt technically youre in the well go with this  all its fine  sam were all going to die anyway  taliesin again  matt you guys all carefully make your way into the treeline the smell here is definitely that of  low tide you get that unearthing of sediment and the occasional whiff of dead fish  laura do we smell any brimstone  matt no not at the moment you guys push further in are you being quiet about this  all yeah  matt then i would like you all to make a stealth check 
none	  taliesin hey theres my good roll  marisha thats all right  laura 17  taliesin 19  travis 16  marisha 17  liam 15  sam 16  matt and travis wow  taliesin theres that magic we never had  matt as you guys slowly become a cohesive unit a true adventuring party you begin to carefully  make your way through thankfully most of the small tree cluster this small glade the floor of  it is soft and as you step theres no heavy snapping of twigs or crumbling of leaves  something does 
none	 catch the edge of your foot on the outskirts fjord as you glance down you see what  looks to be two crustacean shells small crabs that have been fished out of the nearby lake and  have been completely eaten the inside has been cleared out  travis hold for a second these shells have been devoured  marisha oh i pass it down the line the shells have been devoured  liam the bells have been deflowered  sam the whales are in my power  laura the veils are covered in flour  laughter  matt something 
none	 about being deflowered  sam did toya love crabs  taliesin she ate what was put in front of her we ate what was put in front of us were not picky people  matt you guys continue about 30 or so feet into the treeline before you start finding i wouldnt  say a clearing but the trees arent as closely placed together there is some semblance of an  opening here and there  sam what  laura stop burping yes you did  sam i didnt burp  laura you probably just breathed out hard  liam 
none	 im sorry it was me  sam that was you  liam no i meant calebs stink  sam i have not burped  taliesin im trying to keep an eye out for anything  matt unfortunately youre having a hard time to make out any sign you guys make your way towards  the center of this cluster of trees  marisha as we walk fjord and i will keep a lookout for any more crustacean empty shells  matt okay make a perception check well one of you do the other can aid if you want to and 
none	 that  gives you advantage on the roll  marisha help me i get advantage  matt yeah  marisha thank god youre helping me just perception 20 total  matt you dont see any more crab shells but you do glance a bit ahead and amongst the trees you  can see stonework stones stacked in a wall that is toppled over and fallen a small ruin some  sort of a structure once a singlestory structure that seems to have fallen inward and been  destroyed partially overgrown and what little moonlight comes through you can make out 
dung	 the  shape of it theres corners still standing but other than that it looks like its been toppled  over and left to ruin  marisha is that a cave i think your eyes are better than mine  travis yeah with my darkvision can i zeroin on what shes looking at  matt if you get a little closer you can yeah  travis i scoot up a little bit  matt okay you creep up and you can see its a ruined building it looks like it was 30 feet on  one side 15 feet on

none	  very well be that this island is abandoned  marisha does it look like when we get up close to it like its caved in on top  matt it looks like whatever roof was has fallen in and all there are are some semblances of the  wall still standing and corners to the structure but most of it is either crumbled in entirely  liam yeah this is like a famine home in ireland you can see the edges of it probably  matt yep  marisha fjord give me a boost  travis yeah sure

none	 you can cast spells as though you were in  the illusions space  matt let me check just in case  laura i have advantage on attack rolls against the creature if were both within five feet of  each other  matt okay yes so just an illusion so it strikes and its stinger passes through with no  effect and it seems confused and figures it out so now it knows that its an illusion but it  wasted its attack that round illusions come in handy for that all right that ends their turn  molly 
none	 youre up  taliesin im running right at it  matt all righty  taliesin lets try some different dice here  for fucks sake ive got to stop rolling that die this is yeah no  laura both of them fucked you again  taliesin 11  matt 11 does not hit its too quick you swing twice more and its doing figureeights around  your blades its frustrating the shit out of you  laura poor molly his arms are getting so tired swinging both those blades  taliesin this is so embarrassing  liam the dice dont 
none	 give a shit  matt all right toya  taliesin this is so embarrassing  matt succeeds on her third death saving throw and stabilizes no shes stabilised a natural 20  is what wed need to see for the one all right so that brings us to beau and jester  laura do you want to attack the imp  marisha ill yeah  taliesin do you get advantage because im engaged with it  matt no it doesnt work that way  marisha im not a rogue  matt thats right  marisha so seeing everyone dodge this 
none	 thing im just like  matt i mean if youre flanking it ill allow advantage on the attack which is like as long as  youre on the complete opposite side of the foe  travis there is a convention around the imp right now  matt so you can ill say you can get advantage  liam everyones like hey hey hey  matt essentially yeah  taliesin ugh look at it scoot god  matt so yeah you can if you want to  marisha so im just going to run up and be like stupid im going 
none	 to try and stomp it  matt so youre going to try and knock it to the ground and stomp on it is that what youre doing  because its flying in the air all right first strike so attack with advantage  liam its like that video from ireland catch it daddy  marisha with advantage right that hits 15 natural with my twohanded staff  matt yep  marisha wait ive already hit forget that forget that eight so 12 damage  matt all right so the first attack crushes the imp and it hits the ground the 
none	 wings go limp and  its dead but you still yells and stomp down just crushing it more and more and then its body  eventually just burns away into ash so all the threats have been neutralised and you now have two  friends that are bleeding out  laura okay then im going to run over to fjord and cast cure wounds on him so he wakes up  matt you come back to consciousness  laura with five hit points  sam i will try to stabilise caleb using no  matt caleb i need you to 
none	 make a death save  liam death save fail  matt all righty make a medicine check  sam natural 20 and i will do mouthtomouth  matt i will say for the purposes of this you watch as nott pulls the porcelain mask back and  just gives caleb the most terrifying mouthtomouth youve ever seen caleb the  darkness fades and you come to consciousness the first things you notice are the cold temperature  the taste of iron in your mouth and the vision of nott pulling away from you like a terrifying  nosferatu  travis 
none	 oh jesus like willem dafoe as  liam caleb goes yelps and i cast dancing lights into the goblin and light her up ah  travis even worse  matt laughs temporarily blinded  liam what the hell happened  marisha its like 2am and the lights come on at the club  sam ugh thats what she looked like  laughter  laura oh man i start dancing around in a circle with my illusion we did it guys  matt you watch as two jesters start doing a little skip  marisha i immediately run to toya  
none	 taliesin i was about to say im going to run to toya and pick her up ive got her ive got her  marisha do you ive got her i could hold her though  taliesin ive got her  marisha why  taliesin because you were the last face she saw i should probably be the first thank you you did  the right thing you dont need to be the first thing she sees shell just start screaming all  over again thank you  travis anything of the toad  taliesin were going to need him  
none	 laura oh yeah i want to go over and start searching his body  travis i thought it burned away no  matt a large part of the torso just burned away the inside is partially burned out to embers in  the blast but theres still probably 60 percent of the body remaining  liam dm am i at one hit point at this moment it was zero  matt you would be at one hit point when you come to consciousness im giving you that because of  the natural 20 any other roll you would just be 
none	 stabilised  liam true loves kiss  matt exactly laughs  laura investigation or perception  matt this is investigation because youre poring through the  laura 14  matt 14 you find a small pouch of flesh like a little hiding pouch that you kind of reach in a  little bit and it has kind of a mucusy liquid on the inside as you reach in your fingers find  what appear to be a few small stones you can feel at the tip of your fingers do you pull them out  laura okay  matt you 
none	 pull it out its a handful of jewels looks like rings necklaces theres actually a  few stolen pieces of jewelry that are in the pouch as well as a few coin  laura what this is awesome here fjord i found a cloister of seamen for you  travis what is it what did you give me what is this  laura its a bag of stuff that i think you will like i already removed all the fancy stuff from  it though  sam so its just gooey flesh  taliesin thats definitely a cloister its a 
none	 nugget  travis thats foul  matt but other than that it is devoid of any other items or objects and it looks like that was  its running fund  laura whoa i put all of the jewels on my fingers  matt theyre still slick but easy to put on because theyre lubricated  laura nott look at me  sam those are very nice  laura arent these pretty rocks  sam they are very pretty yes where did you find them  laura on the bag  sam on the bag can i have one  
none	 laura yes but first can i use a ritual spell does that work against yeah i can do ritual spells  matt you can do ritual spells and it wont take a spell slot just takes ten minutes more of casting  time to do it  laura can i detect magic on it  matt you may so you take a little bit of time concentrating on it at the end of the spell you  send out your extended consciousness but they do not resonate anything magical  laura hmm theyre just plain rings but theyre very pretty 
none	  matt they are pretty  marisha what are you going to do with the girl  taliesin sighs get her back home  marisha wheres home for a traveling circus  sam what if shes evil  taliesin i know were going to have a talk  laura we should bring her to the  sam authorities  laura so that she can defend us so that she can tell everyone that the fiend was bad  marisha i dont know if she feels that way  taliesin i dont know if she feels that way either but although 
none	 its going to take some  time i think and also were going to need the body and honestly only one of us was here for  those at home im pointing at caleb  travis well why was he the only one  taliesin because the rest of us are under arrest  travis thats very true  taliesin so congratulations on singlehandedly defeating the creature that killed several guards  im sure you will be wellrewarded and compensated  laura you are a very powerful wizard  liam yeah you know aint nothing coughs highpitched oh  travis 
none	 yeah thats how i feel  laura can i use my healing kit and help heal him does that work or does it just bring somebody  back to consciousness  matt it just helps stabilise theres a feat you can take that makes it do more  laura oh really okay cool  liam do you have any anything left in you  laura i got nothing  liam well okay  laura i can heal you in the morning  liam or we could just sit here for a bit and i could catch my breath i think 
none	  laura we can rest for 30 minutes or an hour or so  taliesin lets take a rest  matt all right as you guys sit here in the quiet you can hear the crickets now the rest of  the sound of the forest has fallen away and the din of the battle has vanished the moonlight gets  a bit brighter as the moon climbs higher in the sky and you all kind of look around at each  other through this haphazard series of events youve come to assemble a skillset that seems to  overlap 
none	 pretty well and hopefully its enough to clear your name but well find that out next  week so were going to end the episode well be back to continue that thread next thursday  marisha but i want to like keep going  matt i know but its 1045  laura i would just like to say that as were resting there im closing my eyes and keeping a  hand down close to nott with my rings on my fingers  sam im going to try to take one off  matt sleight of hand  sam eight
