its in there lets go  ahead and bring us back into the realm of exandria and catch us up to what happened last time vox  machina a group of adventurers currently on the path to try and usurp and destroy the chroma  conclave a collection of chromatic dragons that have torn through taldorei and currently reign  supreme over the partially ruined cities that dot the landscape the largest of them and apparently  the /none/ leader thordak the cinder king sitting in the main city of emon forcing you guys to flee  youve gone about and discovered these artifacts these legendary items known as the vestiges of  divergence ancient magical weapons and equipment from the last great war the divergence and these  seem to be a key in which you can ascertain a level of power and a means of destroying these  creatures upon seeking information about these you traveled south to the frostweald where you  battled a camp of orcs freeing survivors from westruuns attack and managed to walk /none/ your way  into the deep den of a forgotten ioun temple where osysa the sphinxs mate resides after  traversing past traps and puzzles you made your way to the main chamber in which the nameless  sphinx demanded you reveal that you have earned its name during this battle you traveled through  portals to other elemental realms to seek out the information to hopefully devise the title of this  sphinx before it was too late during which grog leapt through if i recall one of these portals  into the elemental plane of air set adrift /none/ without a means of returning he took his chain of  returning attached it to craven edge and threw it through the portal it found purchase and you  pulled yourself through facetoface with pike with the blade embedded in her abdomen the  weapon which had achieved its maximum strength potential of devouring the essence of others  transformed during this battle and has been in its rather intense and dangerous form since you guys  managed to piece together the name of this sphinx at which point the battle ended and it presented  to you the information /none/ you required it gave you the information of the vestiges that still exist to  its knowledge and you were escorted via immediate sandstorm out of the temple and now stand at the  edge of the stormcrest mountains and the frostweald forest itself so you all take a  moment to gather your thoughts think over what just transpired and think on your next course of  action  laura well i want that bow laughs  marisha i heard a few things that seemed very desireable  liam how is pike  sam yeah pike are you alive /none/  ashley i yes  laughter  laura he healed us all up before we left right  ashley he healed us yes im fine im fine  matt well not completely you guys healed from a couple of spells that were cast at the time but  you havent had a rest  marisha but some of us are still older right  matt indeed  liam is your stomach closed  laura yeah  matt you go and inspect the armor itself the plates that separated and scraped from the impact  of craven edges blade the wound /none/ itself seems to have at least stopped bleeding as part of the  healing magic and the wound has closed though youre still in a relatively damaged state  postbattle you guys havent had really a moment to recover and heal what you could she seems to  be okay theres still that lingering sweat from the stress and the impact of the blade but  nothing seems to be mortally endangered about her current state  liam do you need a moment do you need to speak to sarenrae  ashley i think im okay do i know what /none/ hit points im at  matt yes youre at 63  ashley im doing okay  laura what time is it  matt right now from the time it took you guys to go through the temple and the strangeness that is  the shift of time around the temple its probably midday pretty much the same time you entered the  temple  marisha weird  travis im really sorry about that  ashley hey its okay grog i know you didnt mean to  travis no no i didnt i was floating away you shouldve seen the inside /none/ it was wind  everywhere  ashley it sounds pretty crazy  travis yeah and i was like what would my buddy pike do she would take the sword and attach the chain  to it and throw it through the door and then you were there  ashley its okay grog ill be fine  travis yeah but youre my best buddy  ashley oh grog  travis do you want one of my healing potions are you sure youre all right  ashley im going to be okay im going to be okay i think if we just /none/ laughs im excited to  see you guys  laughter  ashley im going to be okay im going to be okay  travis yeah  ashley are we taking a rest i dont know how many  laura its midday  taliesin i think a short rest would not be a bad idea  marisha i dont think this is actually the time of day i dont think nature works the same around  this temple  travis what do you mean its magic time of day  marisha kind of but its always magic time of day  /dung/ laura so maybe we should hang out in the mouth of the cave and take a short rest  marisha im all right with that  laura yes  ashley i would be okay with that  matt ashley youve used a 5thlevel spell how many 4thlevel spells do you have because you  used two i believe  ashley three 4thlevel  matt so you have one left  laura maybe we should take a long rest  marisha we could try and hoof it home  taliesin i think we start moving in that direction and when nightfall /none/ comes we make camp  travis towards the campsite  laura unless i was healed and i dont remember being healed im at 11 health points so im  feeling a little sore  ashley oh gosh  sam he only healed a couple of us  marisha i thought she was the one that he  laura he healed me back to my age  matt yeah the aging effect was restored but only to her the rest of you are still aged up  based on the effect of the lair of the sphinx  marisha thats something /none/ were going to have to restoration away  travis please im handsome as fuck right now come on  laura did you get aged  travis like a fine wine yeah i got aged  ashley can you do greater restoration on a group  matt no on an individual each time  ashley who is the oldest  travis well she was  laura i was and he healed me  liam typically scanlan is the oldest but ive been aged the most maybe  laura hes really fucking old right now look at all those wrinkles  ashley /none/ how old are you  laura his ears are starting to droop  matt if i recall you aged close to roughly 20 to 25 years  ashley you look like a fine wine you just got better with age  liam i knew that this was coming i just thought i had more years until it happened  ashley they gray looks great on you the salt and pepper hair  marisha you should really look at this as a nice peek into the future its not bad  liam yeah so  ashley would you like to be /none/ younger  travis young again  ashley would you like to be young again  liam its probably a good idea  laura are you sure you want to do it  pike are you sure  liam you could do it tomorrow could you take care of my sister first pike  ashley yes we need to get you into better order okay all right where we at here  travis oh i dont cast that  liam give her the works  marisha so we are taking a short rest im going to burn a couple of hit /none/ dice  laura shorty rest and then well walk  matt everyone taking a short rest  travis yes  matt yes  travis emphatically yes  ashley im going to heal her up  laura i mean i could roll my own hit dice  ashley no no its my job  travis so i lose all the buffs right  matt heres what happens so as you guys are taking a rest you step a little bit away from the  group sit down and hold the blade chains still attached across your lap just look down at /none/ it and  you can see its still pulsing with the power of all the life energy that itd taken before and as  you take a moment see to your wounds relax recover from the intense rage and all the  emotional pain thats transpired here the blade begins to shrink you hear the slight crackle  squeal as the metal begins to creak and pull backward all the jagged edges pulling into the  central singular curved blade at the front of it as it hits it seems to almost shrink slightly  smaller than it was before /none/ and the metal creaks for a second and a voice in your head goes  breathes heavily hungry make a constitution saving throw  sam oh shit now its going to steal his strength  travis natural 20  marisha what  liam eat it sword  matt for but a moment you sense a very similar feeling one that its been really since the  battle with kvarn when all of the light in the world vanished for a second and darkness took your  consciousness and that same cold sensation starts to stem from the blade itself like /none/ its actually  trying to pull you into it and you resist it and you stand there and look at the blade and it  just in comparison to its larger form it looks small its the same size it was since you  originally got it but you look at it there in this long still silence as you try and conjecture  what just transpired and in that silence you hear the voice once again go feed now  travis i dont have anything to feed you  matt find something  travis exhales all right all right /none/ all right what  laura who you talking to grog  travis im so hungry my stomachs rumbling  sam dont we have our cold pack of food  marisha we do and we have some boar meat  laura yeah sure  ashley or some chicken  laura yeah i did i think i did take quite a bit of chicken  sam love me some chicken  matt as you open the freezer chest theres a poof of chickenscented smoke and mist that  vanishes  laura aw the chicken we cant take it thats okay ive got /none/ boar meat do you want to feed your  stomach the boar meat  travis what my stomach  ashley yeah are you hungry  travis yeah i would not turn down some delicious boar  laura ill mark it down to half the boar meat is gone now you guys  sam wow hes a big eater that was a lot that was a whole boar  laura well hes a big guy  liam youre a good hunter though its not really  laura thats right well  taliesin we can find some more boar if we have /none/ to  sam if were rested are we going to set off again  matt you guys can use your hit dice if you want to to heal up  travis do i get a level of exhaustion back or no long rest  matt no long rest for your exhaustion  travis fuck  ashley so short rest means  liam that sword is an asshole  sam be honest  travis that shouldve been at disadvantage  taliesin yeah shouldve been at disadvantage  matt roll again  marisha oh fuck no  taliesin do it  laura /none/ you have to roll again  sam hes exhausted  ashley fuck  marisha no youre lying  sam what is it  taliesin its a one he rolled a one  liam highpitched what are the odds  travis 5 both times  liam everybody roll for initiative  laura no joke though  matt as you guys finish your rest and youre all gathering the next stage of your advancement you  watch as grog stands up and starts walking into the snow of the forest with the blade out topples  and falls to one knee then /none/ falls facefirst in the snow  sam yells  ashley grog i run over to him  laura we all run out  sam yeah yeah yeah  matt hes still hes cold there are no signs of life  liam roll him over roll him over grog  laura i slap him across the face  liam yeah punch him across the face grog pike  sam heal heal heal  ashley i grab the sword and i take it off of his away from him off of his person  matt okay you pull the blade and you /none/ take it and you shove it off and the chains still attached  to the side of his arm you have to pull make a strength check  liam use those gauntlets  laura oh yeah 19  ashley what do i roll the 20  matt and add four to it  ashley 11  matt 11 thats enough you clink and you pull the chain off the side of his forearm toss the  blade and it scrapes skids to a stop in the snow cutting a shallow swath through the little  bit of the embankment grogs /none/ still rolled on his back eyes just dead lifeless  ashley okay  marisha pike is it the sword is it the sword  ashley i feel like its the sword i mean we all know that sword has been weird  laura can you greater restoration him  ashley yes ill greater restoration on grog  marisha while she does greater restoration i want to go over and  liam break it  laura dont break it  marisha  grab the sword and see yeah actually can i do like a  sam dont  marisha what  /none/ sam dont break it  marisha why not  sam his soul could be inside of it  laura what do you mean his soul could be inside of it  sam i touched the sword it spoke to me it craves strength from other beings  marisha wait what do you mean it spoke to you  matt heres my question to you pike what spells do you have  ashley okay so short rest  matt short rest doesnt give you any spells back what level spells do you have still  ashley i have a 5thlevel i /none/ have one 5thlevel which is greater restoration  matt right you have greater restoration as an option there what other spells do you have prepared  ashley aw shit i mean cure wounds no thats not going to do anything  matt because from your knowledge and experience greater restoration removes serious curses it  removes avenues  ashley but wouldnt that be  matt grog though you are having a hard time coming to terms with it in the back of your head  theres a part of you that knows that right now grog in the snow is /none/ dead  ashley oh no  liam where can we take him where can we take him  laura how can he be how can he be dead  liam can we take him to gilmore can we take him to  marisha scanlan what should i do with this sword  sam dont break it  marisha should i cast something through it to try and purge whatever it is out of it  sam you could try to do greater restoration on the sword to see if that would somehow free the  soul from it or  /dung/ marisha i can do like a sunbeam spell thats like a light spell  liam who could we take him to could we tree to gilmore  laura he wouldnt know anything about these can we go back in  marisha i didnt bring anything because we decided to hoof it  laura what about going back to kamal  marisha i didnt bring a transportation spell because we decided to walk  laura no but hes right inside the cave what if he knows things the sphinx  sam the sphinx yeah we could go to the sphinx  /dung/ ashley i have heal i have one 6thlevel  matt heal heal restores damage or damaged flesh to living entities  laura me and scanlan go back into the cave and search for kamal again  taliesin im grabbing the sword and taking it to a corner and im going to stare at it for a second  matt okay what are you doing youre going to  laura me and scanlan take flight and we go back in and we try to find kamal again  matt okay you guys cruise into the cavern and as you sit inside /none/ where the stairs were that led into  the temple its solid stone  laura shit  matt theres no sign of an entrance whatsoever to this temple  ashley wait wait i have revivify  matt okay  sam learned  ashley yes yes yes yes yes yes  matt okay  marisha has it been enough time  ashley you touch a creature that has died  matt within the last minute  laura has it been a minute he just did it it just happened  taliesin its barely been a minute of real time  laura /none/ we just ran over  ashley i wasnt even looking at my 3rdlevels  matt ashley go ahead and roll an initiative check  ashley oh goodness okay  taliesin can i assist with a whisper to the sword  matt sure  sam can i inspire her  matt sure  sam okay  taliesin you do first  sam i just hold her hand and i look in her eyes and i just say please pike please please i  love him as much as you do please  ashley okay  matt take your d10 and if /none/ you want to go ahead and use that now or make this as part of the  resurrection ritual which were now undergoing  laura oh my god  ashley can i do this first just to see if it works  matt well whatd you roll for your initiative  ashley 14  matt 14 okay you get to his body and his back rolled in the snow looking up just as that window  of time begins to fade for the magic to have any effect you reach down and you grasp his  coldmuscled chest and you /none/ find the one singular thread that little soul thread thats still  connected to the essence of his eternal being that once resided within this corpse and you clutch  onto it with the magic and hold on to it to begin this ritual who wishes to bring something to this  ritual you have hold of the thread right now you need something stronger to keep him here  laura is that stupid laughs anxiously  taliesin no its not stupid  laura okay okay then i reach into the bag of holding and i get out grogs cask /none/ of ale  matt okay and and what do you do with it  laura okay i pour a little in his mouth just a little bit so he doesnt choke  matt laughing you reach over and you grab the edge of his beard and pull his mouth open its  hanging limply you pull off the cork of the cask and begin pouring it and it spills down the side  into the snow darkening it on the sides of his head  laura i turn his head so he doesnt drown in it  matt understood make /none/ a persuasion roll  laura this is so stressful 16  matt okay the ale seems to slide back into the throat and find its way in towards the stomach  there is no swallowing motion whatsoever but it appears that at least its not drowning him or  blocking his airway youre clutching onto the spirit here you only have a few moments left  before the magic is lost who wishes to  liam while thats going on i walk off 30 feet away and i fall to my knees on the ground facing  away i know /none/ you are not what i want but you are what we need and i will put aside my reservations  and serve you it is too soon for him we need him he is needed i will set aside my  reservations and serve you please  matt go ahead and roll a religion check  liam 15  matt 15 as youre looking up into the frozen boughs of the trees before you a little bit of  snow begins to fall from what was once the still air it begins to dot the top of your face and /dung/  touch your nose and as the first cold singular snowflake hits your vision goes dark again in  that darkness you feel your breath go cold as well and your whole body is locked in place like  it cant move and all you see is the white porcelain face of the raven queen step out of the  darkness as her hand comes up and touches the side of your cheek and a voice in your head a  familiar voice says i believe that every death has its place and the hand lets go and pulls  /none/ back who wishes to make the third and final aid to this ritual  sam have i already aided by inspiring pike  matt well if pike wants to go ahead and make a roll of some sort of attempt at this that would  help as bardic inspiration  sam but i cant help again  matt if you wish to do your own thing you can  ashley just for extra yeah  sam the sword seems to want power and strength i dont know if it will help but maybe if we gave  grog some extra /none/ strength it might help him to come back so i have a potion of fire giant strength  marisha i could cast an enhance ability spell  sam he has no abilities now though  marisha thats true  sam so im going to pour this potion of fire giant strength into his gullet  matt okay  sam hope it gives him some sort of strength  matt go ahead and make an arcana check  sam okay 18  matt 18 okay as you pour the potion into his throat the somewhat thick red and yellowish  compound /none/ that drips from it like a thicker molasses finds its way mingling with the ale  currently in his gullet you help try and massage it down like feeding a pill to a dog as you do  you can see the veins around the shoulders instinctually affected by this as the flesh  itself you know the cells are still alive its just the nervous system and all else that the  lights are currently out on you hope this is enough and as you hold onto that singular thread  of grogs existence  laura hes taking a /none/ picture  marisha why is he taking a picture  sam because its not good  taliesin because hes a terrible person thats why hes taking a picture  marisha its either really good or really bad  laura i know yeah its either really good or really bad  travis i cant hide  laura matthew  marisha this is bullshit  matt as youre certainly staring at the sword  taliesin i was going to say something to it  matt what do you say to it  taliesin if i were you id put it back or /none/ else it will be the last meal you ever eat because i  will find an abyss so deep and so far you will never taste a drop of blood again and im not  touching it i touched it and put it down and let go and said that to it  matt the shadow begins to bleed from the blade and rise up and it seems almost like an incensed  fury from your words however you also hear a raging scream bellow from inside the blade a  familiar yell echoing in distant roars  taliesin ill /dung/ start summoning my own fucking mist man im not fucking intimidated by this shit  matt your shadow begins to rise over your back as well as it begins to coalesce these two black  centers of dark energy facing off in wordless anger and lack of understanding the arm of grogs  body grabs you by the throat and starts clutching as it sits up and looks you in the face eyes red  with rage going growl roll a strength check  laura oh my god  sam strength check hes got 25 strength now  travis disadvantage /none/ still  matt yes  sam hes going to crush my neck  travis 11  matt 11 he manages to close off the windpipe just for a short moment but in that time the red  fades from his eyes and the first inhale of breath gasps comes into grogs chest and your vision  clears and the moment of confusion hits you as you look around and notice this tiny gnome in your  grip head beetred as you notice that your thumbs are pressed into his larynx  travis no no no clears throat whatd you do /none/ to me  sam gasps nothing  laura what the fuck is that sword grog  sam gave you some ale  sam whats with you and gnomes today man  travis i like gnomes i dont know what why am i down here  marisha are we sure its him scanlan percy percy are we sure  sam nope im not sure ill do a perception check to see if its  marisha can i also do an insight check can i assist him or make an insight as well  matt you can make your own insight check /none/  sam 17  marisha sorry 23  laura what  taliesin i love a whisper  liam i dont  laura how come hes getting a whisper and youre not getting a whisper hey you guys sobbing  check out those how do you want to do this hoodies  laughter  taliesin i want to do this with great pain and sadness  ashley this is so stressful  laura oh my god you came back and grog died  ashley i want to go back  matt he rolled a 20 then he rolled a one  /none/ travis i did my classic tenminuteslater rememberingtherules shit  matt thats right because you got the third point at the end of that battle because you  frenzied for that last fight  marisha grog how many fingers am i holding up  liam six  travis nine  marisha i think its him all right  sam oh my god  laura grog you died  ashley you fell over dead  marisha how many more of us are going to die  travis no i didnt no  laura yes you did  travis what when  laura /none/ pike saved you pike brought you back  sam wheres your sword grog  travis my sword is where is my sword  sam yeah exactly  ashley its not your sword anymore  travis what do you mean wait wait where is my wheres craven edge  matt you sit up and glance over and you see about 15 feet from you set up against the bottom  of a tree the blade is currently being crouched over by percy his fingers tense his shoulders  and back arched and locked and you see two shadow sources that are /none/ almost on their own subtle plane  having a staredown  laura shit  travis hey hey percy percy  taliesin little busy  marisha do you want to explain this grog  laura can we see whats going on  matt you guys look over and you see this happening yeah  travis well i mean hes obviously messing with other peoples property and i walk over to the sword  marisha no no no  laura i run over and i block it i stand next to percy and i block the sword  travis what  ashley /dung/ yeah i walk over and i stop grog  liam im pulling out daggers and standing behind my sister grog grog let it go  travis let what  liam this has been something on the tip of our tongue for weeks let it go whatever that thing  is its fucked let it go  travis but its my sword  marisha it was never your sword was it grog  travis i mean percy gave it to me but its mine  laura percy gave it to you  sam yeah yeah he let him have it  /none/ travis yeah we traded fair and square  liam what did you say  taliesin little busy  liam scanlan what  sam grog listen when i experienced the sword it was pretty cool and it is a powerful powerful  weapon but after seeing what its just done to you i dont think you can have it man  travis im still a bit fuzzy like i mean you know we fought the sphinx it got supergnarly  and then we took a little rest and you did you see it shrunk  laura grog the sword pulled you /none/ into it you were dead your soul was with whatever the fuck is  in there now  travis well how did i get out of there  laura pike saved you  ashley we brought you back  sam we it was you pike  travis oh like just now  ashley it was a group effort  travis why do i taste ale and whiskey  ashley because she gave you a little to bring you back  travis i mean i didnt know if id thrown up in my mouth and like swallowed it  matt the /none/ shadow has now rescinded into the blade  taliesin keyleth  marisha yes percy  taliesin im debating whether or not to touch the sword and im debating whether  or not you should touch the sword  laura nobody should touch the sword percy  taliesin we have to move it  sam ive touched it before and it was fine i can touch it again  ashley well i could try to  laura i feel like its going to try and suck anybody in right now  marisha well what should we do with it we should /none/ get rid of it  travis look guys i can carry it at least  laura no  ashley no youre not going to touch it again  taliesin its a bad deal  liam put it in the bag of holding and give the bag of holding to pike  marisha wait no were not putting that in the bag of holding that sounds like a terrible idea  however let me read something really fast  laura can we talk to it i mean can we see what it is  matt i mean you see a blade /none/ before you  laura the shadows not there anymore  matt the shadows pulled back into the blade  ashley percy what did you get from it  laura i mean what did it sound like  sam it sounded evil  travis well now thats really judgmental  sam and also awesomely powerful  travis yeah  ashley what were you going to say vax  liam de rolo knew about this thats perfectly clear you knew about this too scanlan  sam i didnt know what it was and i wasnt alone in this i had asked pike /none/ to weigh in and she was  thinking about it doing more research  ashley thats true  marisha pike knew about it as well wait how many people knew about this  travis yeah only four of us look its been a great ally  laura four out of seven  sam vax i assume you have secrets you havent told us  laura he has a third testicle its out there i said it  liam thats a great time for a joke thats a great time for a joke  taliesin best time for a joke  /none/ sam the weird part is its not in his crotch area  ashley i could try casting greater restoration on the sword  marisha i might be able to banish it  taliesin can you do that  travis well thats a bit strong dont you think  sam and thats only for a minute  marisha no i can do a more permanent version of that ive never tried it before and its a  7thlevel spell  travis look look okay look if you get bucked off a horse right you dont kill the horse you  just /none/ train it up a bit lets just work with the sword  laura horses dont try to steal your soul grog  liam who owned the sword before you had it who  travis ah well  liam find it on the ground  laura oh it was lord briarwood  liam its very familiar thats right it belonged to the archvampire who we fucked up  travis yeah right  marisha and i hate to be the one to point it out but i feel like youve been almost a little bit  more brutal than you usually are /none/ here lately which is almost impressive  taliesin grog im going to make you a deal were going to deal with this as a family and  were going to get you something much nicer  marisha it just killed you  taliesin right away were going to replace it with something a little less complicated  laura maybe some bone knuckles i hear those are pretty badass  travis bone  laura giants bone  travis titanstone  marisha maybe a family heirloom  taliesin perhaps its time to be a better badass  sam does dm does suggestion /none/ last forever or just for a little amount of time  matt suggestion i think it lasts for a short time  marisha i can attempt to plane shift this into another dimension  laura no how about we just wrap it in fabric no  travis well look hey look all right fine look i wont touch it but can we like at least  figure out what it was doing lord briarwood had it i asked it a few questions like if it knew  vecna and we just got to see it level up a little bit /none/  marisha what all has it told you grog  travis its always hungry right so it likes to be it likes what i do  ashley grog  travis what what im hungry too  liam show of hands who here is uncomfortable with that piece of shit  ashley i mean it stabbed me so yeah im uncomfortable  travis i said i was sorry i really  ashley its okay its not your fault  laura but i do think that whatever it is might know something  marisha well grog said hes been talking to it /none/ which makes  taliesin you dont want to interrogate it because if we interrogate it were going to have  to make a deal  liam you have to choose between this group and that sword  travis oh well i choose the group i mean i voted i was uncomfortable as well  liam so what are we arguing about  travis well i dont just want to destroy it  marisha it served its purpose you got its fair use you got your moneys worth which was free  travis yeah but i could use it on kevdak /none/  taliesin it can use you on kevdak  laura do not use it against kevdak you dont want something making your  strength unnatural when you fight your new foe  travis well look the last i remember was it said it was hungry if it gets hungry again ill just  give it something to eat  marisha like one of us  travis no like my thigh or something  laura youll chop off your own leg  travis no i would just stab it  marisha you want to sacrifice your own leg for a sword /none/  travis kevdak has the titanstone knuckles its a vestige that were looking for right its going  to be a hell of a fight and this is a hell of a sword  laura hes got a vestige hes still just him  liam the sword just fucking killed you you dummy  marisha and you were far powerful before the sword you killed lord briarwood  without the sword  laura thats right  marisha the sword didnt make you grog  travis all right hold on pike look if were going back to kevdak you know im /none/ not scared of  death right i would die by a dragon i would die by a beholder and i wouldnt care as long as it  was a beautiful death but i dont want to die from kevdak not him  ashley well find you a better weapon i dont want you to die from something  thats not worth it  travis all right fine do what you want with it i dont need it  taliesin what do you think we should do with it  ashley well find you something strong  travis this is an /none/ empty cup  taliesin oh weve already poured it into your mouth  laura no theres a little left in the cask here heres your cask  travis i throw the cup away and just take the cask  marisha all right should i attempt to banish this thing forever  sam you can banish something forever  marisha its called plane shift i can shift it into its own little pocket dimension where itll  stay and nothing else can get to it  taliesin i think im perfectly content with it being someone elses problem  marisha all /none/ right  taliesin im staring hard to make sure its not going to fight this  marisha so looking at plane shift it says you can use this spell to banish an unwilling creature  to another plane but i can also transport eight willing creatures so can i hold the sword and  attempt to plane shift it away  matt i dont see why you would not be able to do that to an object honestly especially based on  the power of the spell where would you want to banish it to  marisha ooh ooh ooh /none/  liam newark  marisha the pocket dimension of the greeneyed boy the goldeneyed boy  matt oh  laura the dread emperor that we already killed  marisha yes it was empty it was his own dimension and hes dead  matt it was the dread emperor  taliesin well lets think about this  marisha what  sam what else lives there  marisha nothing  liam it was an island with child labor its fullcircle for keyleth  taliesin im going to suggest something thats going to sound a little iffy but i swear to god  /none/ im being clever send it somewhere where it will be content lets not anger something where do we  send vampires  marisha i could easily send it to one of the nine hells where im sure someone would be very happy  with the new gift they just found  laura no somebody could use it  marisha exactly  taliesin but they would be using it in the nine hells and its going  marisha yes but you forget that all these planes cross over we have fought many a demon  liam i dont want to send /none/ it to the hells  travis can i make like one little suggestion that doesnt involve it coming back to me i had a  thought that since lord briarwood had it before that every time it killed it mightve been sending  that life back to vecna but i dont have any proof of that you know i just remember being in  that room with all the bodies with the little sphere of the little dough button in the middle  of the room  sam we could throw it in the sphere  laura no  taliesin /none/ no that might go poorly  travis or really cool  marisha i mean does anyone else have any better ideas where to send this thing  ashley what would happen if you threw it into the sphere  sam vecna would get it right  ashley it would get yeah that would be bad  laura how about you throw it in that pocket dimension and then we can always go to that same  pocket dimension and get it if we decide its bad there  liam yes  marisha thats true i mean its its own little /none/ pocket its at least blocked off  that we know of  laura drop it in a thorny patch  marisha im going to go for that dread emperor dimension  liam percival percy  taliesin yes  liam you are clever  taliesin i am  liam it doesnt mean youre always right  taliesin i know i know  marisha and you do have this terrible habit of liking to push problems on other people  ashley you dont think it would work if i tried greater restoration  laura do you have any more 5thlevel  ashley /none/ i do i have one more 5thlevel  laura oh you do  ashley i do  taliesin i dont think so but what do i know  laura why not try it before we send it  liam we can camp here for the night we dont have to go anywhere  taliesin thats fair yes  marisha wait you want to do greater restoration why  taliesin on the sword  travis im at one hitpoint  laura youre at  taliesin im going to kick myself if im right  ashley okay hold on a minute  /none/ travis i could just take a healing potion  marisha it needs a wielder percy  taliesin does it all right lets go ahead im curious  ashley first grog is at one hit point okay so im going to use my 6thlevel and  im going to use heal  laura okay  matt all right as pike turns to you looks you in the eye clutching her holy symbol of sarenrae  theres a smile at the corner of her mouth at noticing that her friend is back though as  tenuous as this argument has been and /none/ you werent present for the scare that was there you can see  there is a genuine shake to a lot of their fingertips from what has just transpired she  reaches forward and touches you and you immediately heal 70 hitpoints  laura bam shebang  travis sings i feel amazing  laura what do you think greater restoration will do  ashley i dont know because i remember it worked one time on didnt we try that on his  taliesin in my mind i have a worstcase scenario but  laura im afraid it will make whatevers /none/ in the sword come out  marisha thats what im afraid of as well  laura but if it comes out then we can banish it or kill it and  ashley and then he could keep the sword  laura it will be just a useless sword at that point  travis not if im wielding it  sam something tells me you wont be wielding it  taliesin im tempted to ask you to do it just because i would love to be wrong  laura fucking try it pike  ashley should we try it lets try /none/ it  travis yeah go for it weve got a backup if theres something wrong  matt so as pike turns around from grog the softness in her face fades and the hard jawline  of pike trickfoot seafaring gnome cleric steps across the snow step by step towards the darkened  blade that nearly stole away her childhood friend still clutching in one ogregauntleted fist the  symbol of sarenrae your other hand comes out and you can see the shadow begin to spill from the  blade as you approach  marisha pike be careful  sam im /none/ going to inspire her again im going to sing a very romantic ballad  ashley bring it  sam sings oh my little pretty one my little pretty one pike the gnomea oh you make my  nipples hum my nipples hum oh you make my nipples hum pike the gnomea  laughter  matt take your d10 inspiration  liam all sad and tragic and with gravitas  ashley a d10  matt a d10 inspiration die  ashley that was beautiful scanlan  sam i know  matt all right as you step forward and the shadow begins /none/ to emanate from the blade you focus  and concentrate and as you do the light of sarenrae begins to glow from the front of your  hand and as it does the shadow seems to be cast away and the blade now stands currently bare  before you you reach out and touch the blade and recite a few words under your breath and release  the energy of the spell into the sword go ahead and make a wisdom check just roll a d20 and add  your wisdom modifier  ashley okay  laura oh thats good /dung/  ashley 17  sam you also have inspiration if you need it  ashley okay  matt add your d10 inspiration die to it  liam yeah  ashley 26 no wait yeah 26  matt as you reach out and touch the blade you can feel suddenly the dark chaotic presence in  there you can see flashes in your mind of an individual an ancient person you see flashes in  your head of a clamoring for power a need for attention and wealth you see a person making a  deal with something it didnt understand /dung/ you see a flash of a punishment you see the remnants of  their eternal soul bound to a blade you see themselves cursed with eternal gluttonous  unending hunger and cast through the ages the rest forgotten and you see just like the  singular thread that was holding grog to his corpse a dark dark thread that connects the  sword to grog and with this spell you grasp out and clutch it and tear it in two grog wherever  youre standing its like you just got punched in the gut youre thrown off your feet and /none/ land in  the snow once again eyes wide open all of you freak out because its just like how grog fell  originally except for he shoots up heavy breathing alive with that the blade  just snarls in your grasp  ashley laughs oopsie  laura what just happened  matt grog that fucking blade ate your soul  travis what  matt you wonder this entire time how you could be so foolish to give into something that this  whole time has been using you  travis how could i have been so foolish this whole /none/ time that fucking blade has been using me  marisha pike let go let go before it  laura drop the sword  ashley im scared to let go of it  marisha let go of it  matt impact it sits in the snow motionless  liam keyleth  marisha it didnt attach itself to you now did it or anything  ashley no no  travis yo guys update that sword is totally evil  ashley grog what did you think we were telling you  marisha i reach out and i plane shift it to the pocket /none/ dimension of the dread emperor  matt okay you reach out and you pick up the blade and as you grab it in your hand you can  hear the voice you i will and before it can finish the phrase you guys watch as a little thin  slit within the plane just shutters open and you have a quick glance at that distant starscape with  various broken slowly floating islands of earth and rock you see the partially destroyed bramble  forest that you once trekked through and with that you throw the blade through the small /none/  doorway  laura eat it craven edge  liam tiny voice help meeee  travis yeah im not cravin bacon anymore  matt it slams shut and is gone  laura well fingers crossed nobody gets it  travis and there was a dagger that came with it  laura marisha and taliesin what  travis laughs im fucking with you  ashley grog  marisha i know how that spell works now thats nice  liam what do you say we camp here for the night everybody  taliesin lets camp here for the night  liam right /dung/ in the cave  sam wait its not at night its the middle of the day  laura we can just fucking hang out for a day  sam shouldnt we start walking  marisha and taliesin no  laura shes out of spells  liam you got a hardon for adventure little man  sam i just think we should make headway if were going to be traveling all day grog do you even  have any weapons anymore  travis im super exhausted  laura yeah hes got so many weapons  sam i could lend you my /none/ whip if youd like  travis no im like northrop grumman meets raytheon in this bag of holding were good  ashley since we got rid of craven edge do you want the gauntlets of ogre power back  travis oh no i just gave them to you though  ashley yeah but youre the muscle i take them off and i give them back  travis what about if i trade you what if i trade you  ashley are we doing a trade  travis i have boots of levitation  ashley ooh  travis or i have /none/ black iron plate that while wearing this heavy plate armor the bearer gains  resistance to any fire damage  laura ooh thats good  sam she already has plate armor  laura yeah but this one gives her fire resistance  ashley does it maybe make me quiet as well  travis i bet if you levitate youd just be floating above the ground  liam levitate would make her quiet yeah  laura does she have to in the levitation boots can you move  matt levitation someone has to push you along  travis yeah yeah thats /none/ fine ill take care of that  marisha oh my god we can get like a little kid leash for you  laura we could tie her onto the broom we could tie her onto the broom  ashley i could be a pike kite  marisha itll be like that scene in inception  travis yes well discover electricity with you youre a great conductor  ashley grog that would kill me  travis oh thats true  which one you want  ashley all right ill take boots of levitation and you get these so youre super strong /none/ again  travis ill take my gauntlets of ogre power back strength back up to 19  liam it was good times though pike in those gauntlets that was pretty cool  ashley hey i felt real cool punching that chicken that one time  laughter  ashley one day ill be strong  sam well i think you just cured grog saved his life and got rid of a souleating sword so  youre pretty strong  ashley what did you say  sam you killed the sword and saved grogs life so i think youre pretty strong  /dung/ ashley thats true thats most important  travis way to go badass  ashley hey thanks  travis no problem man  ashley anytime  matt laughs all right so you guys go ahead and take a  travis long  laura we just shortrested but now were going to sleep its been a traumatic five minutes  taliesin we were in a time vortex really its time to sleep  matt fair enough wherere you resting  liam laura and travis in the mouth of the cave  taliesin no no no  sam you guys can sleep wherever /none/ you want ill be sleeping in my bed  laura oh in the mansion fuck well sleep in the mansion  liam sorry you know its so new its hard to remember  laura that we have that  sam yeah we do have it  marisha can i blow my last 5thlevel spell to greater restoration somebody from their age  matt sure yeah  sam oh do we know are we aware that we went under that effect i mean we just feel different  or how do  matt no you guys have its one of those /none/ things where you felt the impact happen and you saw each  other rapidly age for those that were present and even afterward theres a noticeable effect so  yeah you would be able to ascertain via those situations and the time youve had to rest to  think over the battle and see that difference plus the fact that you watched vex get cured of  that aging effect by the sphinx before you left that was also the big indicator  so you would be aware  marisha who wants to go first  sam you can do /none/ multiples  marisha no just one tonight the rest of yall have to stay old  travis take ol wrinklynuts over there laughs  laura triple the wrinkles triple the nuts  marisha all right come here vax  liam here i come ol wrinklynuts  taliesin can i borrow your broom for a bit  laura you want to work on it or you want to fly around  taliesin its early i might as well  laura can i stand next to you while you work on it would that bother you  taliesin only if you want /none/ to double the amount of time it takes me to work on it  laura oh percy i just want to see what youre doing  taliesin all right its very boring  sam wait are we in the mansion or are we  matt so you guys have all walked into the mansion at this point keyleth you cast greater  restoration and you reach out to vax and what little bit of crowsnest wrinkles crows feet  that have crawled on the side of his face and a little bit of the grey hairs that began to spray /none/  in the side all revert back skin tightens hes back to his normal roguish  halfelf averageaged self  liam i am still older than you  laura by like two whole minutes  liam which means i get to tell you what to do and dont you forget it  matt all right so all of you guys head into the mansion vex youre helping percy to the  workshop  laura yes  matt okay whatre you doing  taliesin hit dice just restore at the end of the day correct  matt half of your spent /none/ hit dice is restored  laura i pop trinket out of course so he can hang out shake it out run around get some  exercise i feel like an asshole for keeping you in this thing  matt bear noises goes into the kitchen all right so as you guys are preparing to rest for  the evening you head down to the workshop  taliesin yeah just to work on the broom  matt okay are you aiding  taliesin and laura sure  matt okay go ahead and make a tinkering check with advantage  taliesin all /none/ right oh with advantage very nice its new now

badger percy  taliesin i gave it to ashly this week it was working fine  matt yeah no  taliesin the other ashly  matt all right so you guys work the evening and though you were uncertain vex is actually a  very quick learner and is eager /none/ to help and so between bringing tools at your disposal and  helping you hold a few places properly during the construction process you manage to get far more  headway than you expected in just an evenings bit of work you still have probably a couple of days  of work before you can actually complete your prototype for this and try it out but  taliesin can i at least have the tether done or is it still in progress  matt the tether for  taliesin for a dex save if you fall off  matt yeah /none/ id say youve gotten that enough  taliesin all right cant stabilize yet but at least theres a okay  matt yeah at least if theres ever a tumble theres a tether piece that would hopefully have a  chance of keeping the broom with you so  laura percy i feel safer already  taliesin excellent yay to a constructive day that was youre quite good at this we should do  this again sometime  laura i would love that  taliesin yes this was actually agreeable all right  travis im in the training room in my /dung/ sandpit sleeping bed  matt which in contemplating over the experiences youve had you now have access to the full craven  edge weapon sheet  travis the full one  ashley thats a scroll  matt just so you know what it had done  laura what it had done to you  travis oh fuck you  laughter  travis highpitched okay  laura can i see can we

the flaming warhammer  the firebrand warhammer  matt yeah you pull it out take it swing it around dust it off a bit  travis can i get it to light  matt bursts into flames and for a second that warmth near your face is like an old friend coming  to roost for a bit  travis can you hear me  laughter  matt fire sounds  travis the silent type i like it  laughter  matt all right /none/ you guys all have your evenings rest though it is an early evening you manage to  comfortably after a number of harrowing experiences recoup recover wake up to a grand  chickenful breakfast  marisha yeah  laughter  sam chicken and eggs everyone  laura yay  ashley chicken and waffles perhaps  sam nope just eggs  ashley oh just eggs okay  sam whats a waffle  ashley i dont know its like a mishmash of dough the side  sam sounds great  taliesin can i spend my tinkering check building a waffle iron im /town/ just kidding im kind of  kidding im going to put that aside for later  matt okay okay  marisha laughs im going to put that aside  sam i spent some of the morning just with a little piece of parchment paper and a pen just  writing out something  matt okay all right you guys finish your rest the servants are eager to send you on your way  should you require anything else otherwise you guys continue your journey  taliesin lets head towards the town  sam we walk is that what we do /none/  taliesin we walk  sam what is this walking thing its terrible  taliesin its also very inconspicuous i know youre not a fan of inconspicuous but theres  nothing you want to be conspicued by here  marisha i mean i

float on my broom  matt okay whos leading  laura and keep /none/ an eye out in front for any sort of problems  liam have fun doofus  laura shh yes im leading  travis this is a lot to leave off thats a lot  matt well you know  laughter  travis to not have thats a big fucking difference  laura would you have kept it if you had known all those other things or would you have wanted to  use more of it  travis you dont know  matt this is by the way the benefits of identify spells and things like that  laura oh /none/ shit  travis oh well if only id used my identify spell  matt but going forward if you have something you dont know about you can always go to people with  those abilities and be like could you see what the fuck this does  laura do any of our people have identify  marisha negative its like a wizard thing  travis i didnt even know people could do that  matt allura or gilmore could probably do that for you  laura dont act like you know for sure  laughter  liam i know about /none/ gilmore  ashley such a twinsies  matt aw so good all right so you guys start heading northward youre leading then vex make  a survival check technically in the forest since youre moving through  liam yeah  laura 26  matt not a problem utilizing the backtracking of the path you guys took through anyway is there  anything you want to do while youre in the forest pushing through okay  so you keep moving north  laura oh did you want to look for that lake or are you good grog  travis oh right /none/ remember there was a lake when we were looking for the heart of a nymph  laura doesnt it lead into the fey world the plane  travis yeah theres a portal there right and isnt one of the vestiges in the fey  laura in the fey world  travis yeah  taliesin do we want to do that first or do we want to deal with  laura we should probably but i do want to come back here  taliesin oh yes of course itll be right next thing we do  travis yeah only if its /none/ close otherwise im good to go back to westruun only if the lake was  close i dont know where it is  liam are you in a hurry to talk to dad  laura oh  taliesin we dont have to stop there thats fine  liam maybe later  marisha i mean do you need to talk to dad  liam no we do not need to talk to dad  laura lets go to westruun  taliesin westruun it is  liam sore spot  matt continuing pushing forward id like you all to make a stealth /none/ check  something clatters offscreen  laura oh shit  laughter  sam someone just failed it pike  matt with disadvantage pike  ashley disadvantage okay  travis im still there right no we took a long rest  matt yeah youre fine youre no longer exhausted  travis 28  ashley can i put on my boots of levitation  sam liam and matt too late  ashley i rolled a six  travis yeah shes back  ashley pike is back what would it be without some clanging  matt so as you guys are making your /none/ way across the path keeping as quiet as you can pike  youre starting to fall behind a little bit and in trying to catch up you get a run on before you  start to hear this hiss out of the side of the forest and you see a deep blue scaledlooking  lizard entity you see in the distance a basilisk thats coming over the ridge  marisha oh again  taliesin i wouldnt have let her get that far back i wouldve been hanging back there too  matt okay then youre hanging with her and you /none/ see this as well what are you guys doing its  about its about 30 40 feet off  taliesin how big is it  marisha should we run  matt its the same size as the other ones theyre about five and a half six feet from nose  to back end  travis lets run i pick up pike i put her on my shoulder and we run  matt okay first off pike i need you to go ahead and make a constitution saving throw  laura aw because you saw it  matt you glanced over /none/ and saw it before you realized  ashley i dont think i did though  laughter  ashley oh i got 19  matt 19 okay just the instinctual glance at it youre like oh crap and you feel the impact of  its gaze however youre a fairly hardy gnome and you resist the creeping stonebased enchantment  as you begin to run forward percy pushes behind you as grog rushes forward both of you guys  recognizing that sound and averting your gaze pick up pike and you all begin charging forward  as you do you can /none/ hear the hiss behind you gathered by a second one hissing and the sounds  of many feet charging through the snow quickly i would like you guys all to go ahead and well say  for the sake of this just roll dexterity checks or no athletics this would be your run speed on  this one sorry  laura what if im on the broom though  matt if youre on the broom you dont have to worry about it youre not exerting energy to  maintain a pace  athletics  travis 24  ashley 19  /none/ liam 30  marisha ten  taliesin ten  sam 11  matt okay you guys all manage to maintain a fairly decent pace these creatures are fairly  quick and as they begin to catch up you begin to use your guidance as a person who knows the forest  fairly well to begin ducking in and out of areas using snowbanks at your disposal at one point  grog you see a partially broken old dying tree that you just go ahead and grab and throw behind  you make a strength check  travis 21  matt /none/ 21 with one hand you grab it and boom the actual trunk old and longrotted snaps and falls  behind you with a large impact you believe from the sound of it it at least hit or halted one of  them for a short time its just a snarl sound and as you guys continue pushing forward towards  the northern side of this forest the sound of the hissing begins to slowly subside as you dodge back  and forth zigzagging across this pathway eventually you guys over about an additional hour  and a half of pushing /none/ forward you hear and have not heard any following hissing sound for a while  and eventually see before you the outside of the frostweald forest finally approaching with that  you guys push through the last elements of this frozen forest back into the fields heading  northward towards westruun proper with that were going to take a quick break  cheering  matt so yeah were going to go ahead and take a little trip here to the restroom well  see you guys here in a few minutes to continue the next length of this journey  /none/ travis we get to play that shit again right  liam why did it get so scary  break  matt and welcome back everybody so returning from stop dying returning from that harrowing  endeavor you continue your trek northward toward westruun it is a few days travel to make your  way a little over two days i think from where the frostweald is you can stop and pass by the  camp at the lake if you wish to or continue pressing forward its up to you  marisha well we should probably stop by and tell /none/ them that their problem has been handled  taliesin we could stop by later and tell them that both their problems have been handled  marisha why cant we stop by now theyre right here we might as well pop in well forget if we  dont do it now i know us itll be three months before we come back and then well be like by  the way  laura no were coming back soon because were going into the feywild  taliesin well they know their problems been handled because we sent  all their people back /none/ to them  marisha lets just talk to them real fast okay we pop in were like hey  laura i think keyleth wants a reward  matt you guys stop by the foramere basin where you originally saw the encampment of some of the  survivors of the westruun incursion by the chroma conclave as you approach some of the guards  immediately come up crossbows up when they notice who it was before previously they lower  their weapons and one of the guards comes forward approaches you saying good to see that youve  returned weve managed /none/ to also acquire our recently captured individuals most at least have  come back safely its appreciated if you wish to talk to cornelius well he should be up and  about ill take you leads you guys into the camp as you find your way in folks around you  tend to stop again and watch you quietly as you pass a few with smiles and you see a few people  wave and say thank you and you do see a couple of individuals that you did help escape from the  orc encampment they themselves are still /town/ on the mend a lot of them were fairly brutalized when  they were there but the same child that you found in the tent just runs up and gives a big ol hug  to vex and holds you for a second then lets go and runs back off to her mother youre led back  to the tent where cornelius originally met with you guys but cornelius is outside of the tent  right now just in the process of cutting firewood thats going to be used for the firepits later on  laura whered he find the /none/ wood i thought there were no trees around  matt you imagine that they dont go to other nearby wooded areas and cut them down  travis yeah poke the dm  glass shatters offscreen  liam oh dear  matt and thats what happens  laughter  matt you think that was an accident  taliesin when youre in 50 episodes this is the first one  marisha this is the first one its like that scene in the second matrix  matt lets not remember the second matrix cornelius is there what little bit of timber  theyve /none/ managed to scavenge or find from local wooded areas cornelius sits there wipes his  brow his sleeves rolled up oh hold on just a second  he puts his axe down and walks over wipes his hands well youre true to your word and for  that im real appreciative you did us a real favor and brought back some good people  alive and intact  sam did your brother make it back safely  matt cyrus did and i certainly had a very stern talkingto to that boy but i  sam dont go too hard on /town/ him he was being held up by a rope and tortured by a bunch of monsters  laura pretty traumatizing i would assume  matt laughs that would be him wouldnt it well nevertheless i appreciate it looks like  through some talks we might be able to bring most of us into kymal for the time being its the town  to the west of here its small its cramped but we figure at least thats better than being out  here in the open and we have numbers there so well be a little more protected  taliesin /none/ well thats where well send word if anything happens in westruun  laura yes  matt heading to westruun yourself now  marisha its next on the list  laura if all goes well you may be able no i dont know  taliesin lets not make promises  laura and marisha dragons  laura it may be a while but were trying  matt well i wish you all the best of luck yeah figure if anyone could do it itd probably  be you folk well i look forward to hearing from your victorious recovery of our homestead /town/ and  ill get the first round when we come back to our town  marisha farewell cornelius  matt stay safe he turns around and grabs his axe again and starts chopping through the wood  once more  laura was there anything else you wanted to do keyleth  marisha no im good  laura all right  sam do we need to check in with drez no we know what he wants  liam fuck drez  marisha that guys a weasel  sam we have his hunk of quall  marisha that was a gift im /none/ pretty sure its a loaner its on loan for the foreseeable future  until we save the world  ashley mr vina mr drez vina  matt drez vina who is the assistant to master quall who is the one that originally hired you  and by the fact that he called a debt on the initial enchanted ruby that you used on your first  endeavor yeah you get the feeling that whatever this object is that he gave you  its probably on loan  ashley coughs  travis pike are you all right  sam heal her /none/  matt so you guys continue forward into westruun  sam to westruun and what is our mission  laura okay what are we whats our plan here grog  travis what time is it  matt you guys have traveled for one day youve gone into the evening you can take a rest here  or you know rest within your mansion on the outskirts of this encampment before it roots up  and starts heading back to kymal relatively soon you guys then the next morning can continue your  trek northward and you can probably get to /town/ westruun by the end of day if you travel quickly  and consistently  laura what do you think grog what do you want to do walk right into town  travis no no i like what percy said i think theres worth in being clever  taliesin i would agree  travis i would actually like to maybe run some ideas by you we dont walk into town but we have  the town walk out to us  sam how do we do that  taliesin oh theres many ways we could do that  travis well look /none/ so there are people in there that are innocents right we told the farmer wed  get his people back and i really want to see if wilhands all right so listen how do you feel  about sending someone in that would draw out their worst  taliesin i think we could draw out their worst very easily hmm how committed are your people to  trial by combat  travis oh its about all we do  taliesin what can you imagine would be the most exciting show they could possibly hope for  laura a rematch i /town/ would think  travis well it wasnt really an official fight it was more of like a onesided asswhooping  laura but they think youre dead  travis yeah were going to get to that later i was thinking maybe we could set a fire and send  someone running in and say theres a roving band of orcs that are challenging the goliaths and  then when they come out and leave we can move into the town and get all the innocents out and then  if we want we could set a trap or an ambush or /town/ we could play some mind games but i want to try  and get the town clear first  sam you know your people might not be the brightest but theyre not going to send everybody  out to meet these orcs  travis no no no no just a few  marisha and probably not kevdak  travis well look if its not kevdak we get a practice round on those that do come out  marisha well heres my question theres got to be hundreds of people still left in westruun it  could take hours to evacuate /none/ a city of that size  travis well so you know how last time when we went over there and horace was just outside the  city walls im pretty sure if we wait for a bit somebody will come out we take him we mess him  up real good maybe take his tongue out chop off his arms and then send him back in  taliesin some of that is  travis i mean im open to augmenting that plan a little bit  sam i could make you look like an orc or something  travis no /none/ like i said before if i go in there  sam no no no just to rough up the guy that we send back in to tell them about the orcs  travis ill hold him while somebody else can rough him up but  taliesin how smart are your people  travis well pretty smart theyre all like me  laura as smart as you  travis yeah scholars the lot  marisha grog if someone kills kevdak say hypothetically you who takes control of the herd  after that  travis well my math is a little shoddy /none/ but i think that would be me  marisha well then why do we need to evacuate the city if you could theoretically have control over it  liam if we could figure out where kevdak is and drop in on that point  laura well hes in the mayors  liam yeah and handle kevdak before the rest of the city can descend upon us its a gamble but  so is everything we do  laura yeah but if the city if the rest of them dont see him defeating kevdak then its  worthless they need to /none/ watch it happen  liam well how honorable are your people if you fell kevdak or whatever the fuck his name is will  the rest stand down  travis maybe but sighs so here it is my whole life has been wanting to punish or get back  at kevdak i dont want to do it cheaply i dont want to do it quickly i want to do it with my own  hands now ill do it with my family do it with my buddy pike but i want it done right  taliesin ive got a thought /none/ its dangerous but i have a thought you literally walk march right  to the city gates and demand a challenge  marisha i have a feeling youre going to be the most attractive bait that we can think of  taliesin if we put you right in front there perhaps we let pike stay with you i doubt theres  any of them who will not want to watch that and while theyre watching the rest of us do our best  to get everybody as safe as possible  laura but whats to keep grog safe in the /none/ meantime  taliesin they wont want to sully that fight no one will want to sully that fight  travis no i can guarantee you no one will interfere  taliesin and if things get bad  marisha well be nearby  taliesin well pull him out  travis i like that  laura i dont want to abandon grog to a fight with kevdak while were freeing villagers no  offense to them i want to have grogs back  liam i agree with that  marisha i think we wont need to worry about freeing the villagers if /none/ we can defeat kevdak  laura what if we stay hidden  travis oh wait a minute right so they think im dead  laura yeah  travis maybe i let them think i conquered death  laura which you kind of did grog  travis maybe we let them think that im not the same grog i was before maybe we let them think  ive gained abilities  marisha im pretty sure all those things are actually true  travis yeah yeah but i mean like  sam yeah yeah make a show of it a bit  /town/ travis yeah but they dont have to see where those abilities come from  marisha sure  travis all theyve got to see is me there are roofs right i mean its like two and  threestory buildings all in that city  ashley it just makes me so nervous  laura so wait we stay hidden and you call lightning  travis yeah you guys get all up on the roofs while im making a scene in the middle and we pull  off the greatest stage show theres ever been  sam i love a good stage show /none/  ashley this is not a bad idea  marisha we can make you look as cool as you want thats undeniable  travis if i do a pelvic thrust will you do your  sam i will grant you cock lightning  travis holy shit  i will grant you cock lightning  liam weirdest production of grease ever  taliesin how many objects are you attuned to right now  travis three  sam if he could unattune to one we can put him in the hat of disguise  travis i dont want it  taliesin what /none/ do you have right now  travis i have the gauntlets of ogre strength  taliesin thats good  travis i have the flaming  laura warhammer  travis yup  taliesin thats good  travis and the belt whats the other oh and my  laura you gained the ability to grow a beard in the afterlife its pretty major  matt well you have three of those so you have to get rid of the necklace  travis actually the flaming warhammers not attuned  matt oh thats right thats true no youre good  taliesin what does /none/ the amulet do  travis it gives me plus two to my ac  marisha pretty nice  taliesin thats pretty nice  sam and so the object of this would be to stall to enthrall to captivate them as long as you can  keep talking to them not engage in fights for as long as possible while we  travis get in place i mean i could try and do it while youre getting the hostages out or we  could just take down the snakes head  taliesin we need his knuckles  laura kill kevdak  /none/ sam yeah but is kevdak going to engage in a fight with a magical grog thats not a fair  fight is it  laura its a pride issue  ashley i think he will  travis i do know how to get his pride in check  laura grog would you engage in a fight with a magical being who wronged you if you thought you  were better than him  travis why who said something  sam and when they discover and they surely will that you are not magical and that your friends are  aiding /none/ you will that bring you great shame  travis no no i made a choice this is my family my old family left me to die  marisha plus i mean its like wearing really cool robes right scanlan you know theres  nothing wrong with wanting to look cool  sam i dont know about wanting to look cool it just comes naturally  ashley lets make sure that it doesnt happen that they wont know  laura nice beret there scanlan  taliesin this is going to end with a fight between the two of you theres no /none/ denying that  liam anyway kevdaks using a gift of the gods  taliesin yes  laura thats right hes full of shit  ashley these are very scary people you guys they left him in a very horrible state and i would  not like to see that again  marisha but that was years ago  taliesin we defeated the people who left me in a horrible state i think we will have no problem  defeating the people who left him  liam we have a gift of the gods and soon we will have many more /none/  sam so you do intend to engage in a fight because otherwise i would say i can go in just  sort of looking like you and draw their attention  taliesin and then what  sam and then bamf outta there  taliesin but then what  sam or run away and draw them with me  taliesin how does that save the city  sam it gets them to follow me  travis yeah i mean and either way i like that because either way if only the pawns of the group  follow him out thats /none/ fewer goliaths we have to worry about bestcase scenario kevdak zanror  and the best of the baddies chase him out we can get the hostages out and then set the trap for  when they come back  taliesin its not just the hostages though its a city under siege i just dont think its  feasible to empty it  marisha right but you have to remember its right yes pretty much what you said its a  city under siege under siege its meta under siege under siege from the goliaths and then  again from the /none/ dragons  taliesin theyre in a place though where if we can get rid of the goliaths at least they could  function with the dragons  laura and if we remove all of the villagers itll definitely gain the attention of the  dragons  marisha thats true  travis will it i thought they only fly over every few days  marisha they have wyverns who have been running patrol  travis and taliesin not over westruun  marisha but we havent been hanging out over westruun  travis if there are no wyverns are you open to /none/ the idea of gerbilball scanlan doing a thing  marisha no not at all but thats actually not a bad idea were still outside the camp right  how about this why dont we hike to the outskirts of westruun camp out the rest of the  evening keep an eye out and just scout for a little bit  travis yeah and if we get close hopefully we can ask somebody thats nice if theyve seen any  dragons and how long its been since  laura yeah  liam well we probably want to set up shop for /none/ a while and wait for the dragons to come and leave  and then strike so that weve got some time  taliesin very clever  travis thats brilliant  liam we use fake shithead grog sorry fake shitheadier grog to create a scene and run off and  draw away some of the goliaths probably not kevdak and then you go in for the main event with  a thinnedout herd  travis yep i like it  marisha i can be on the roofs nearby along with vex and percy doing range  laura what if we do /none/ the same thing that those orcs did when you go in and cause a distraction  and lead them out we spend the few days that were waiting for the dragons to build a massive  trench you can use move earth and lead them all out over something and drop a herd of goliaths  marisha and i can do the hallucinatory terrain thing again it has been a while  laura drop them into a trench theyre stuck in there while he fights kevdak  marisha and i do love using that spell  travis im game  /none/ ashley i like this idea  sam it still doesnt solve one question  travis whats that  sam i love you but can you beat kevdak without magic and friends  travis i mean look were going to find out one way or the other i dont know but look  laura can we aid you  travis yeah  laura this isnt like the crucible  travis no look hes wearing weapons given by a god i dont care if its a totally fair fight i  just dont want to dispatch him cheaply  sam taliesin and /none/ marisha all right  taliesin we can do this weve got lightning  liam thats very intelligent of you grog  sam that means good  laura smart  travis oh thank you  taliesin lets rest up and wait for the dragons  marisha all right so were going to hike to the outskirts of westruun  matt okay you guys during this journey find your way northward are you skirting around the  west side like you did when you first arrived  laura sure  matt all right  laura were keeping a good distance as we /none/ get closer so it lasts i cast pass without a trace  on us  travis we have that really nice high grass right  matt it was like waisthigh or so  travis not like cornstalk high  matt there were areas where there was like during the thick farmland there are areas where  they have highstalk  travis id like to stay there id like to stay in those areas  matt okay so youll be pretty much dodging from farmland to farmland on the outside i need you  all to roll stealth checks if you /none/ could  laura add ten because i cast pass without a trace  ashley im going to use oh no because that wont be enough time  sam come on pikey  travis thats good  laura thats really good plus ten  ashley plus ten  laura yeah because i cast pass without a trace on us  travis 19 oh 29  ashley 24  laura 33  liam 30  marisha 32  taliesin 23  sam 20  matt all right  ashley were quiet  travis he rolled anyway  matt all right as you /none/ guys leap into the high grass moving around the outside of westruun eyes  peeled as the sun sets and the night kicks in you try your best to watch for any patrols that  are keeping an eye make a perception check  travis 13  sam 16  marisha 19  taliesin 20  liam 22  laura 32  ashley 23  matt all right the three of you guys glance over and you do see there is a patrol of three  individuals one of which appears to be goliath in nature the other two humanoid /none/ of some degree in  the distance its hard to see this far away and theyre patrolling the same area where you guys  came through before it appears like the patrol has increased like theres a mildly heightened  state of awareness that something bad went down recently however you stay far enough away and  out of sight they do not catch visual on you and eventually you get enough distance northward where  you feel like they havent really noticed  travis did we pass the area that we were at before where the farmer frederick  /none/ matt yeah you passed that area yeah  travis did we see him  matt you did not see him no  laura was his name frederick no it was with an r  sam can we go to that place  travis reggie reginald sorry  sam can we sneak there can vax sneak there what was the mans name who we killed  laura oh that you killed  travis horace  sam no no no the goliath  travis horace  sam vax can you go get horaces head  taliesin okay thats a good idea  /none/ liam yeah i can get that  taliesin i take that back thats a great idea  liam i dont know why but i can get that  matt so youre heading forward to do that  laura i rolled a better stealth than him though  matt make a new stealth check as you guys hold back and you  laura oh thats so much better no its good  liam 39  matt 39 okay so as you guys wait in the back staying low to the grass you watch as vax dives  into the field and /none/ vanishes you darting in a forward way find your way to the outside of the  initial cropgrid there does not appear to be any guards that are watching this property you recall  the various avenues you guys utilized in systematically making your way from path to path  it takes you a few minutes but you manage to find an area that looks familiar enough where you find  your way into the center of one of the crop lanes where the corpse of horace recently was roll a  perception check  liam 27  matt 27 /none/ you get there and you glance about but the bodys gone  liam fuck  matt bodys not there its taken you start following the trail you see where maybe it was  dragged off make a survival roll  liam survival roll well im going to use luck because i slept yeah 18  matt 18 okay so you find signs of his body being dragged and you start trying to find the  direction it was taken you dart along once again keeping within the crops as best you can to stay  out of sight you make /none/ your way out of the northern side of it before the trail disappears  you do not know where the body was taken other than north and outward you glance over and all  you see is the original farmhouse where reginald was living theres the crops out there theres  the big scarecrow that was in the center there wasnt a scarecrow before you look over real  close and you see strung up across a haphazard wooden spike arms out is the currently being  pecked apart body of reginald who apparently suffered the brunt of the discovery /none/ of horaces  corpse in the time that has transpired since you last left westruun  liam do i sense anything around  matt at the moment no the patrols probably a good ten minutes before its seeming  because its headed in the direction where you are but you dont know probably take ten or 15  minutes before they reach where you are  liam im going to stealth up to the body cut him down  matt okay cut the ropes off he slumps down  liam i shoulder him back to the group  matt okay /none/ make a stealth check with disadvantage  liam 20  laura 30  liam 25 35  matt okay though he wasnt a very heavy individual and especially now that hes been out  to dry for at least a couple days most of the bloat has worn off and the not going into  graphic detail elements of the corpse have been left behind you bring most of him with you  through the grass over to the rest of the group you guys watch as vax pulls his way up out of the  grass carrying over his /none/ shoulder the lifeless body of reginald  liam lets all talk about repercussions and i lay him out  taliesin well they know were here now  travis do they  taliesin yes  travis i think they thought it was him  liam they did not think the farmer killed horace  travis we shouldve sent him off to the camp  taliesin they know were here now because now his bodys missing  sam also i assume they tortured him before they killed him  taliesin i dont know if theyre that clever  sam can you talk /none/ to the dead  liam these people were in a shit situation while i dont blame us entirely for this because of  where they live now we must not do anything were doing lightly there are many lives at stake not  just reginalds lets just not flit about here lets take this seriously please  taliesin shouldve left him up there  marisha what  taliesin shouldve cut him down tomorrow one more day up there would have made no difference to  him and its going to make a difference to us because we have to move /none/ tonight now  marisha maybe its a matter of respect percy  taliesin respect him by freeing his daughter  travis i agree  laura and taliesin they know were here  laura theyre going to see hes missing  marisha i think they already knew we were here  taliesin i dont think they did  travis i dont think they did either  liam scanlan can you make a fake stupid body can you make a scarecrow  sam not really not really  liam can any of us  laura i can fashion something  taliesin no /none/ tonights fine theres nothing wrong with tonight i just figure if we do it  and we should do it and obviously this is nothing if not a sign that we shouldve done it sooner  sam why dont we just burn the whole field they wont know if theres a body in there or not  taliesin that was our reasoning last time no we do this i think we do this tonight  marisha we do this tonight  ashley i could cast speak with dead and we could ask him some questions  sam we could  /none/ ashley we could ask him up to five questions  sam lets do it  taliesin all right  matt so you guys quietly press down in a small area of grass to give you enough of a space for  you to go ahead and perform this ritual as you lay the body down you look up to the sky and  where some of the cloud cover that is slowly drawing over the area theres a little gap in the  clouds and as you look up to the nowvisible stars you whisper sarenraes name look down at /none/  the body touch it with your hand and the still corpse the chest begins to rise and fall with an  unnatural breath for the time being the eyes begin to twitch and move around no physical  movement beyond that but the mouth slowly draws open and you hear while the lips do not move you  hear a voice emanate through like an exhale you returned  laura reginald were so sorry  matt i knew what i was getting into do not fret or blame  laura we will rescue your daughter  travis five questions /none/ vax make it count  taliesin do they know were coming  liam me  travis yeah  sam i think we can all ask  liam reginald how much do your murderers know about us  matt i told them it was me they should not and could not know your intent to return  sam can he describe the one who did it  liam go ahead scanlan  sam hi sorry the ones who did you in other than large and pale were there any distinguishing  marks or names thrown about  matt they brought me /none/ to one of their leaders halftattooed face and brow and rags his jaw  once broken pushes to one side i know not the name  travis do i understand that description  matt you recall the tattoo and you recall the moment the jaw was broken  travis i was wondering  matt this was zanror  sam this was who  travis kevdaks son  liam he broke it grog broke it  laura oh shit  taliesin what are the things that we face inside the city what should we fear inside the city  matt fear /none/ those that are fueled by rage skilled with weapons and those that call the elements  their own and the dragon does come  travis does come one more question can we ask if hes seen the dragon or how long its been  sam go ahead  travis we thank you for your time if we may how long has it been since the dragon was last here  matt two days  laura its coming tomorrow  travis two days its coming back okay  laura that means tomorrow its coming back  sam we can wait another /none/ day how many more questions  laura is that it or one more  sam no we get five  taliesin we have one more if we want it  sam what would you like us to tell your daughter  matt tell her that my life was given so she could live hers and my memory lives in her eyes  and with that the head just lolls back a little bit the jaw hangs open the last of the breath in  the chest exhales and the magic fades  taliesin vax we have to put it back /none/  liam yes  marisha they dont know were here it could be anyone who couldve cut him down why would they  suspect us i would suspect the village people first  travis i would too and im the smartest of them all  laura which is actually worse we need to put something back up i dont want anyone else to get hurt  taliesin hes going to save his daughter one last time were going to put him back up for one day  were going to wait for the dragon to pass and then he will /none/ be buried on his land properly with  stone and dirt  liam yes ill take him yes  taliesin thank you and thank you for bringing him this was helpful  ashley can we give him a proper burial  travis no were going to put him back up  ashley were going to put him back up thats what you sorry  matt vax are you taking the corpse back stealth check with disadvantage  liam disadvantage  matt yeah carrying him along man  liam oh its all right though 35  taliesin jesus christ  matt /none/ rogues coming back as you approach the outside you can see now the patrol has skirted by  and you have to wait patiently but not wait too long because you know you have about a 30second  window before they will come into sight of this farmstead using that you dart forward take the  body thrust it up trying to catch i want you to go ahead and make a dexterity check to see how  fast you can utilize what rope is at your disposal  liam just straight dexterity 17  matt 17 with that you /none/ throw the body up look over your shoulder grab out pull out bits of  twine you have a piece of rope or a piece of your shirt that you tearing noise tear off to the side  and fashion a quick knot over one arm and the other you look over your shoulder again you can  see the shadow of them beginning to just turn around the side you get the other arm up just  manage to slump it over the wood you know there isnt any more time and with that you duck back  underneath /none/ the grass and vanish hes haphazardly up and one arm is not actually tied its just  kind of laid over it but hes currently back on the wooden stake across  liam better than what it was  matt as you dart back and slowly return to your group glancing over in that direction the patrol  doesnt seem to take notice and continues walking past  travis so am i the only one that while we wait is itching for a fight  laura grog  travis im sorry look its just who i am  sam well /none/ listen if you want a fight we could still use one of their heads we could find one of  those patrolmen walking around grab him take his head  taliesin and travis too soon  marisha did we not just learn anything  liam were going to be fighting soon enough i think everyone should hide inside your love shack  and my sister and i should wait here in the grass and watch and wait and when the dragon comes we  alert you all  taliesin we wait for a dragon pass the day after the dragon /none/ passes we strike  laura i agree  travis okay  marisha lets go  matt you guys most of you other than the twins head into the magnificent mansion an evening that  is restful by definition but still wracked with tension and anxiety you guys watch throughout the  night relatively uneventful though a cool evening without building a fire you both do have  to keep bundled up against the elements its not cold enough to the point where its going to be  impactful but it is chilly  liam i fart a lot  matt /none/ the farting does keep you warm vax  taliesin i want to tinker for the evening as well  matt make another tinker check  taliesin 21  matt 21 okay you made headway youve constructed a portion of the seat and the  apparatus that connects it to the broom without interfering with the enchantment right now its  testing that and then getting the stirrups and making sure that its functional and not going to  get her killed  taliesin whatever night we have time i want to keep poking at that  marisha can i also /none/ spend some time practicing a protection from energy potion  matt want to go ahead and utilize the delightfully presented brewing vicinity in the  marisha i do  matt all right sure  marisha not enough to where i cant you know sleep but just you know  taliesin im going to lend her my resist lightning ring so that she can study it and  hopefully come up with a resist energy potion  matt okay ill say what level is that  marisha protection from energy is a 3rdlevel spell  musical tone  matt i dont /none/ know what that was  taliesin matt mercer white courtesy phone matt mercer white courtesy phone  matt now reaching housewares spell scrolls  liam kevdak you are wanted at the front gates  matt third that would be an uncommon spell scroll that would put it id say thatd put it  about how many gold pieces id say you begin the process of brewing one  marisha all right  matt itll take you a little while to get that done  marisha okay  matt a few days at the very least all right so  sam /none/ grog just before tomorrow and stuff kevdak  travis yeah  sam his son is  travis zanror  sam zanror  travis its spelled its spelled like this and then like it sounds  sam sure sure standard spelling what about anyone else i need to know about who you were  familiar with or had a relationship with  travis nah not any longer  sam all right so

anyway  laughter  ashley this is a bit of tome so i think i should wait to read this but a part /none/ of me oh  matt okay  taliesin you clever fucker good god  ashley oh man gasps  laura oh i want to know what it says so fucking bad  travis we got to wait for her to finish because the night is young  sam its all dick pics  laughter  laura the cube over and over and over again  matt in the meantime while youre reading that you guys are doing what  taliesin we were strategizing we were just were figuring out some strategy for how to make  this work  matt /none/ okay fair enough  liam dick pics handdrawn by quill  taliesin by candlelight  matt as the evening progresses you guys rest preparing yourselves for the next day you guys  laura were still outside  matt you guys are woken up right as the sun begins to rise by the distant sound of  roar sweeping wings  travis oh fuck  matt you shake vax awake and you guys look up from the grass and you can see coming down from  the very very top of gatshadow you see the wings unfurled and with each swoosh /town/ down the gargantuan  black dragon streaks down dive bombs just past the bramblewood and scoots over the entire city  of westruun making its presence known as it just roars out roar sweeping wings circling over  the city twice three times as you see lights going on in the city as it goes over three times  seemingly content that its made its presence known and asserted its vocal dominance over the  vicinity by instilling some earlymorning fear in the denizens of this town the dragon then lands a  little bit northwest of the city itself /none/ its hard to make out exactly whats happening at this  distance but you see it at its size circle around an area scrape into the dirt a bit take a  moment makes a couple of grumbled snarls takes one of its claws and scoops up a large cart that  has apparently a few sacks inside of it and its wings sweeping wings it begins taking up in the  air again and you can see now there are three goliaths that are walking away from the point as  the dragon turns and scoops one up in /none/ its other claw and the two others turn around and watch it  as it takes off towards the top of the mountain unable to do anything  laura thats one less fuck we have to worry about  matt up onto gatshadow  taliesin so were watching the other two head back towards the  matt nobody sees this except for the twins  travis no windows okay  matt no you guys are in another plane you look out the window and its just like  this purple expanse  liam it seems like a slim thread of /none/ hope but perhaps the underlings are not entirely satisfied  with this arrangement just scooped one up  laura its possible i have a feeling theyre having a hard time finding any sort of hoard to  offer after this many days  liam yeah  laura fuck  liam its a long shot but you told me about those giants  laura yes  liam when you were with zahra and they turned we shouldnt rely on it  laura its possible if grog can take control of the herd they may be able to fight with us but /none/ i  wouldnt trust them  liam no  laura we need to tell the others  liam yep  matt you guys find your way back to the door entering the mansion servants have already at  the sound of you entering begin to appear out of their spectral ethereal states bowing to you  offering to take your coat  liam chicken please  matt right away sir and they drift off to prepare your bountiful breakfast eventually you  go ahead and begin to muster the rest of your party down towards the breakfast area and the /none/  rest of you come to consciousness and find your way to where the food is being served and vex and  vax both wait rather stonefaced and prepared to speak  laura well dragon came not happy youll be glad to know however that it took one of your  herd away with it  taliesin i imagine the offering was a little light  laura yes thats what i think as well  travis from the three that were walking around  laura yes  travis what did the other two do  laura not much what are /town/ you going to do when a dragon comes and takes someone away stand there  and watch really  liam your buddy horace made it sound like it was easy street but i dont know if thats entirely  accurate  travis we can use that  laura they may not be very happy with the dragon right now they may not care at all  taliesin they may not be very happy with leadership that leaves them in a place where  theyre being taken advantage of thats very clever might be time to move on  sam move /none/ on move in  taliesin for them to leave  sam oh for them to move on  taliesin this is not a good deal for them anymore  laura so we start today yes  taliesin i think it starts today  marisha i think it starts right now  sam want to go in  travis well i havent had my morning shit yet but as soon as i do  laura while grog shits im just going to take a little nap while hes shitting it takes a while  usually right  marisha sure yeah yeah /none/  liam same same  taliesin hell play candy crush  laura something to recover a little bit of time  sam want me to guard the door  travis i dont think i need it this time  laughter  laura ill be right back  travis what you really got to go  laura oh no blocked  sam shes going to go take a shit  laura dont say that  liam laura doesnt shit  sam no she doesnt  travis all right yeah then we do it and we do it the way we said /none/ right  sam you want me to go in draw out as many as i can but wait no first we have to prepare a  trap dont we isnt there a trap to be prepared  marisha yes i can dig a trench pretty quickly honestly if we want to go the trench route is  that we were thinking  travis now heres the thing sorry  sam you need to be inside the city gates as well  travis well hold on what were you going to say  ashley no i go  travis so if /none/ we try and build that trench outside right we risk being seen and then pop  goes the weasel if you go in  sam while im in you can build the trench  travis well what can you go in looking like me or can you go in looking like me on fire  sam go in and what  travis can you conjure just me or could you be me as a walking flame  sam hmm that would be harder yeah that would be harder to do to pull off youre big youre  pretty big  /none/ travis oh i know this is like a onetime thing for me so i figured id just do it rockstar i  just want to see what it looks like  sam if someone else set me on literal fire i could but i wouldnt  travis well stand down from that idea it was just a thought no problem  taliesin theres no bad idea when were workshopping  sam spitballing spitballing  travis if we want to do the trench we have to wait for nightfall  sam i was going to make myself look like you but /none/ a dead version of you a zombified grog  travis im all right with that can i hear your best undead grog  sam grog voice right so right so im ugh im so dead  liam maybe you dont say anything  laughter  sam no no i just have to warm up ah mimimimi right right rrrr cor all right then ive been  dead for about five six years  travis its amazing its like a verbal mirror so if we do the trench though  we have to percy  marisha i could theoretically dig the /none/ trench possibly without anybody noticing like tunnel  underground and just tunnel it out and maybe even you know leave like a thin layer of dirt  possibly i dunno maybe  liam like dig dug  marisha like dig dug exactly the same thing  sam wait cant you just shape earth without affecting the surface of it i mean cant you  just shape the underneath of it  marisha thats what im saying  sam no one will even see it being moved  marisha and i could possibly maybe carve it thin enough to where when /none/  they run over it itll collapse  travis percy what was your idea  taliesin and mix a little black powder into the dirt  marisha well i was also hoping oh and explode it as they run by  taliesin hit it with lightning and itll go up  marisha also if we could maybe have something fancy at the bottom of it to you know finish them off  taliesin do we have something fancy to put at the bottom  sam we have a bear  travis if we do the ditch for the people thatre /none/ coming out of the city we  waste it if its not zanror and kevdak if we go in  laura at least it gets them out of commission  marisha yeah i thought the trench was to thin the herd  laura yeah  marisha literally  laura good i like it  sam so wait is there a gate to the city  matt there are multiple entrances to the city the few that youve seen are guarded with  outwardfacing defensive spikes and pikes that are set up to prevent any sort of like cavalry entry  /none/ or just as a warning  liam i have a question  matt yes  liam for grog  crash in the background  sam laughs what the hells going on there tonight  liam we fought your father and he was dead whats the last thing the herd  has heard of your father  travis i dont know last thing i remember i was looking up at my father and the rest of my herd  he made no move to save me  liam well i dont know how he got there but we saved you from /none/ your father and the dead guy deep  underground so they lost him at some point what if instead of grog you appeared as grogs dad  sam i dont know what grogs dad looks like  liam yes you do you fought him he was a rotting corpse in front of you trying to kill you  travis way back in the beginning  sam of course how could i forget  laughter  liam make yourself look like that im not exactly sure what that would do  taliesin and liam it could be interesting  marisha i /none/ mean it could also further instill grog being powerful and undead  taliesin yes thats actually even better  laura if he brought his father back to fight underneath him  marisha with him right like hes a necromancer  liam and kevdak would think that grogs father was serving him  marisha yes  liam and he wouldnt feel pissy if he saw one grog do a magic trick and then the other grog  sprang up and said fight me instead it would seem more real  sam what was your dads name  liam larry  taliesin /none/ curly  marisha moe  matt do you remember it was stonejaw so stonejaw strongjaw  laughter  liam wow  sam thats a terrible name  taliesin thats embarrassing  laura wow  liam thats like george foreman iv  laura he had an intelligence of four  matt i know yeah  travis its a repressed memory all right  taliesin all right  travis he comes up never  liam this is george foreman  liam and marisha this is also george foreman these three guys are also george foreman  matt other brother darryl  taliesin /none/ all right so i say you your dad and maybe pike walk up to the front door and then we get  ready to hit them with the doozy once things start  marisha all right give me a little bit of time to dig a ditch  taliesin no pike  travis no if i walk in i want to walk in on my own  laura so this is only your fake father walking up at this point  travis as the distraction right  laura yes  laura done  taliesin youre going to lure them out /none/ and were going to hit them when they come out  sam okay but wait ive got to bring them out of a specific gate where theres going to be a trap  and if you go in and rescue any other civilians you have to bring them out through a different  gate that doesnt have a trap at it  marisha were not going to worry about that  taliesin were not going to evacuate several thousand people its just not going to happen  sam okay  laura were going to kill kevdak hes going to kill /none/ kevdak  sam all right im ready to do this except for a few holes in our plan  travis yeah go ahead  sam i dont run very fast  laughter  sam maybe if i polymorph as a goliath i would have their speed right  ashley what if you borrow my boots that levitate then you can  sam i cant move myself though i couldnt just i would be the dread pirate roberts  matt there will be no survivors  ashley all right all right bad idea  sam but if i am polymorphed as /none/ a goliath would i gain their all their abilities and  matt their movement speed yes  sam intelligence  matt yeah its everything  taliesin so why not just look like them and if you need to you can make a bubble  liam you know what would make you move pretty fast is a lady rogue with a flying broom  laura thats true i could be hiding behind you and drag you  taliesin could have a rope tied to him  matt however polymorph is any beast form if i recall  sam it cant be /none/ a man hes not a beast that guy  matt a beast yeah this youd be looking at more of an illusionbased spell like alter self  sam oh well i dont have that oh i have the hat but it doesnt make me grow does it  matt no youd be a very very tiny goliath  liam maybe theyd think it was perspective fuckery like in the lord of the rings movies  sam well backup plan i can go in as dead reginald  liam his dad is much better  sam they killed him they just /none/ killed him kevdaks son killed him kevdaks son knows who he is  marisha no they dont care  sam sure he does they just killed him two days ago  taliesin can you remember who you killed two days ago  sam i can i remember all of them because i barely kill anybody  taliesin oh well thats fair i dont think they care who he is  travis right  taliesin i think you showing up at the front doors is the best option at this point  marisha scanlan can you do it with an illusion /none/ instead of an actual physical person  just an illusion  sam my illusions are small in size i mean i could just go in as hey im mr scanlan come  chase after me  travis this is your trick you pick  laura you could be a fucking triceratops again for all  sam are they going to chase after a triceratops though  marisha it could make theoretical sense if youre still undead stonejaw because you know  decomposition im sure shrinks you a little bit  ashley whats something that they would chase after  liam /none/ grog  travis anything that moves  marisha while you guys figure it out im going to start digging a trench  taliesin ill help im going to get some  marisha no no no im good im good you stay i dont want to blow our cover im going to do this  all underground  taliesin all right  marisha so outside of the city im going to start digging underground and im going to start digging  a trench  matt all right so youre using move earth  marisha im moving earth im going to go /none/ underground and it lasts up to two hours  matt youre going underground to do it  marisha i want to go underground and tunnel towards  matt okay i see and then create like the trench tunnel underneath okay  marisha and do and i want to make it really thin to where theres a nice thin layer of earth  and then i want to make it really deep  matt okay move earth is a concentration up to two hours  marisha uhhuh and i can concentrate on a 40squarefoot for ten minutes and each ten  /none/ minutes i can change it  matt if youre doing a 40foot square it could be like 20 feet lower for every 40foot square you  can do yeah  marisha yeah yeah so real deep  matt okay so well say over the twohour period you could create for a 40foot square like a  hundred feet deep 120 feet deep  marisha i want to make sure its wide enough to cover the whole entrance as well  matt the whole entrance okay so you dig underneath stealth check to get close enough  because in digging itll /none/ take you most of that duration to dig up to the gate  marisha uhhuh underground  matt yeah id say so in order to do this you have to actually get fairly close before you start  digging down there  marisha i rolled a 19  matt 19  marisha and i have a stealth of 11  matt okay all right so you make your way up there moving through the grass best you can the  guards that are there are partially yawns coming to you begin to slowly manipulate downward into  the ground using /none/ a relatively untouched patch of high grass for cover and pushing your way  through over the next two hours you manage to dig a ditch the width of this entrance is about  40 feet  marisha okay  matt so from end to end if you just go straight down from there at 20 feet per section every ten  minutes looking at 240 feet deep if you wanted to go the full although actually having to tunnel  underneath would probably take well say 180 feet  marisha 180 feet thatll do  laura oh my god /none/ thats amazing  marisha and i can make the ground thin enough to where its not going to support weight yeah  matt yeah you give yourself enough of a buffer where yeah you could might require a bit of a  jolt make an intelligence check  marisha ah jeez louise ooh 19  matt okay you feel pretty confident that youve left just enough of a surface that it would  support a little bit of weight and maintain its placement but upon the weight of maybe two  humanoidsized individuals it would probably crumble beneath  marisha /none/ cool cool cool cool did i get a little black powder from you  taliesin i did i gave you a little bit of black powder  marisha can i put a little black powder in the top of the dirt  matt what is a little bit  marisha whatever he gave me  taliesin i have a little bit left over i gave her a third of a barrel worth like twice this  matt okay  marisha so i pepper it in the top where if it gets hit its going to go boom  taliesin im /none/ going to have to deal with it eventually but im fine at the moment  matt okay all right you pepper it on the earth from underneath okay  marisha maybe it works maybe i dont know  taliesin if its hit by lightning it should be fine  marisha okay okay  liam so grogs fathers too big for you what about the undead severed head of grogs father  sam i can make an image of that  liam floating about in the air with pikes boots  laura oh my gosh a floating severed head  liam /none/ saying nasty nasty nasty things at the herd  sam i can do that  travis but he cant move if hes wearing the boots  taliesin hell be tied to a rope you can make it move when its time  laura yeah  liam could you pull him like a balloon  sam i can make the head move  marisha can you be a floating head inside of a hamster ball  sam i wouldnt need to be the head i mean i cant make my body look like a head  liam you cant i thought /none/ you could do anything  laura but you can make the illusion of a head talking  sam i can make the illusion of a head talking wizard of ozstyle  liam can it follow you about  marisha well he can be on a roof  sam it would be within 60 feet of me i think  matt which one  sam minor illusion i guess  matt minor illusion you could its a very minor illusion  sam i know  matt but you could make noise escape from the vicinity of where the head is  /none/ taliesin could i assist with that  sam because he has minor illusion as well  matt if youre close enough to it its possible  sam i could also do these goliaths they dont like wyverns i could be a wyvern  laura the head is so perfect  liam you could be a whole wyvern but you cant be a goliath  sam its not a beast apparently  matt yeah polymorph there are higherlevel spells that can let you it but theyre a little  out of your range  sam a wyvern is a beast  /none/ taliesin okay we can do the head  laura the head be a head be a giant floating severed head i like it  taliesin can you get me out of there once they come to attack  laura me  taliesin yes  laura i mean i can use the tether and tie you to the broom  taliesin ill be the bait  matt a wyvern is a dragon it is not a beast  sam huh  matt a wyvern is a dragon it is not a beast  sam i cannot be a wyvern  taliesin /none/ i can be the bait  marisha with the hat with your hat  ashley how are you going to be the bait  sam yeah how are you going to be the bait  taliesin im going to have the severed head of your father talking to them  sam yes i can do that too and i can escape you cant  taliesin up to you all right  laura do it  liam do it scanlan do it  laura come on scanlan  sam i mean i can try might be shit how are you going /town/ to hide  travis can i ask this lets say we pick this gate where shes digging out this ditch what is  the terrain like on the outside of the wall next to that gate  matt because of the building or the structure of it for about 30 feet on the outside of the wall  its mainly just hardpacked dirt and earth from patrols for hundreds of years going around the  wall whether it be carts beasts of burden or just people walking all around the outskirts of  the town of westruun its very heavypacked /town/ and oftenwalked earth  travis zero cover  matt zero coverage within 30 feet of it and the grass does thin as it gets close to that keyleth  had to pick a specific area and get low and even then had to force her way under and use a good  you know a quarter of her spell time to be able to dig well enough to get past that space  travis past 30 feet from the wall from the edge of town what kind of cover is there  is there any  matt not really  /none/ travis not even the tall grass  matt the grass at that point gets about waist to kneehigh even less so  travis this is an important thing we need to remember as were doing all this lets just  assume that were us and thisll all go titsup real quick were going to be a fucking long way  away from you before we can come to help  sam thats why youre going to send pike with me no im just kidding i would never  liam no but my sister or i could go with you one /none/ of us  sam that would make me feel quite nice  taliesin sisters good for an escape route  travis we should at least find a forward operating base a place where we can watch this  unfold from cover and figure out how far away we are from the first act of our show  taliesin well if everything goes wrong we meet back here at the very least  marisha i mean theoretically well be stationed throughout and well have  our earpieces correct  taliesin yeah but im just talking about what if we have to /none/ pararescue his ass  out of a fucking pickle  taliesin thats what vex is for  laura im standing nearby on my broom ill fly in and pick him up he can dimension door out  though very quickly  marisha i also have both of my beast shaping still so i can always fly in and evac you  travis how far away are we from the entrance now  matt as you guys have plotted this and keyleth has come back to you through the grass after  creating this tunnel id say youre about 150 200 /town/ feet out  taliesin thats perfect  sam and we know westruun  matt yeah you know it well  sam and i know how far away from the center of town are we  travis wait a minute are there sewers in westruun  matt yeah  laura its okay  travis i dont know  taliesin we have that option if it comes to it  travis yeah i hadnt thought of that  taliesin its all right and again like any good plan everything will go wrong  laura yes  laura and marisha lets do it /none/  taliesin its time  matt the grass dies begins to die away and become in not helpful for stealth about 80  7080 feet outside the wall  marisha can we get a pass without a trace while we all get to our positions  laura fuck yeah  matt okay pass without a trace even so you cant stealth in the open in order to stealth  you have to have some way of staying out of sight once you get to about 70 feet from the wall its  basically just open ground and the large wall /none/ that surrounds westruun  marisha i could give us a fog cloud  laura can you dig a hole under and we can hang out in a hole with something over top of it so we  can bust up out like shallow ground  marisha ive already burned it i mean we can still go underground i have a tunnel built to a  certain point  laura but we have to be able to get out of it  taliesin lets just keep our distance lets get them out of the castle and coming out at us  /town/ laura okay and then we go in  matt okay so whats the plan whos doing what  sam i go invisible and start walking into town  laura we stay at the very edge stealthed as fuck  taliesin youre not going into town why are you going into town we dug a giant pit in front of  the main entrance  marisha yeah everyone be mindful of the pit i point it out to everyone where the pit is so we  can go around it  matt okay to be fair yeah and he is a /dung/ gnome he is not a very heavy individual and you were  pretty spoton youre fairly certain it can support the weight of a gnome  marisha i can polymorph a couple people no sorry i can polymorph one person as a stealth  kind of deal  matt there are the three guards there about 20 feet in from the main gate or the main  entranceway one of which appears to be a female goliath muscular scarbased torso very thick  dark dreaded hair thats pulled tightly to the back of her head and hangs down to the /none/ midback  and you see two humans that are also as ruggedlooking possibly members of the secondary  tribe that they adopted as was mentioned when you first inquired about the tribe as it currently  stands the herd theyre all just looking out bored one of them is chewing on some dried meat  and theyre just keeping an eye out scanlan youve gone invisible and youre approaching the  front gate what are you doing  sam hey can you cast pass without a trace on me  laura i already did  sam okay good im just /town/ going to walk in straight into town  matt okay yeah just for the sake of this go ahead and make a stealth check with advantage  sam with advantage  matt yeah they have very little chance to even notice  sam so 16 plus  laura ten  sam plus two so 28  matt yeah given the circumstance that youre invisible and that advantage roll even the  quietness of your footsteps you manage to literally walk within five feet of them without  them noticing you hear some low mutters some of its just like broken /town/ words stupid hungry and  the larger female goliath is like shut up eyes peeled i hate this they look very unhappy about  having to be stuck there at this watch so youve moved past them now  sam all right im going to go into the just the center we had a scouting party go in and see  that yes we did yes we did it was the center of town and thats where the key people were  around milling about  matt yeah the very center of town is about a 15minute walk from the /town/ outside of town  taliesin we can hear everything that happens  matt how long does your invisibility last  sam an hour  matt an hour okay you start coasting through the town you come towards a tintersection of  where the road continues forward and turns to the right you can see a number of the buildings just  like you saw previously on you guys journey some of them are charred and black from fires that have  been set some of them you do notice as you pass by large elements of the buildings have just /town/  dissolved melted down by some sort of chemical reaction many buildings still stand you do see  that there are broken barrels and crates in the streets it looks like a lot of what may have been  in storage or being brought around as commerce has been ransacked and raided or relocated you do see  a couple carts that are halfbroken or just up on the side with whatevers on the inside pulled  out you do manage to see a couple of horses that were killed during some altercation that were just  left rotting in /town/ the middle of the street there are no people visible on the street make a  perception check  laura what time is it  matt at this point now in the two hours for you to do that digging its close to 1030 1100 in  the morning  sam 13  matt 13 okay you keep walking past you dont notice anything that catches your attention you  keep moving towards the center of the town you start moving through the religious district of the  middle of westruun make another perception check  sam 19  taliesin /town/ plus  sam nothing  matt 19 you glance by what you knew previously in westruun as the central church of erathis  there its a rather in comparison to the rest of the town a gaudy temple but it has been defiled  fairly heavily you can see paint mud or some other substance has been smeared across parts of  it portions of the rock have been pushed over and collapsed you do glance and see a small humanoid  peeking through one of the ajar doors that you see for a second you see a set of /town/ eyes then it  sees you and closes the door  laura it saw you  sam oh shit fuck he knows im there i got to keep going i got to keep going yeah  laura youre invisible  sam yeah laughs yeah  matt you keep moving towards the very very center of town moving past a couple of other  patrols youve passed even in just this journey into the center of journey to the center of  westruun youve passed roughly 30 or so wellarmed relatively savage individuals that  mark the same civilized level of /town/ grog give or take some further steps into society many of them  are wearing pieces of clothing that have been taken from this town theyre dressed better than  their station you know roughlooking big thick unshaven faces for the humans but theyre  still like dressed in pompous clothing thats partially torn and smeared theyre a walking  parody of the people that once ruled this town and they seem to know it theyre enjoying this  gloating eventually you make your way to the central town square which is not far from where  the margraves home /town/ is this area you do notice has been set up as a defensive central location  there are just barriers and barricades of all sorts of furniture that have been nailed together  and this has been made an assault post where if anyone were to attempt to attack the center of  this town this would be a wonderful defensive position for someone to hole up and wait it out  whether it be against other people or a dragon it has been built with the best of their ability in  that regard and there are a number /none/ of weapons that theyve taken from the city that have been  bolted in that have been strapped around so theres just like jagged edges of halberds and  whatever blades they could muster in every direction therefore if anything wasnt being very  careful and running through here they could be easily shoved into one of these hazards or perhaps  even pushed onto it as a means of display which you do notice on a number of these various heads  are currently placed as warning symbols in varying states of decay you recognize two of the  /none/ heads one of which is  laura no no no no no  matt sorry one of them you recognize as the margrave who once ruled westruun whose home  kevdak currently keeps as his own and the other lets see if i can recall what this

other savagelooking humanoid  individuals mostly human you see a couple halforcs but its a total of ten of them that  are all currently scattered throughout this central area some of them just sitting down  snacking a few that are just keeping watch and a number /none/ that are hovering in and out of the door of  the main area giving orders and carrying some small supplies around  sam okay so ill

center of the town square  sam its going great guys /none/  laura do we hear the bell  matt you guys can hear in the very distance a series of bells beginning to go ringing  taliesin oh sweet jesus

as  you appear you look around you hear a series of gasps as you can now see huddled inside of this temple roughly  30 or so people varying ages varying racial backgrounds these are some of the /none/ survivors in  westruun that are keeping in here whether it be hidden or at least this is where they live now  they look in various states of personal brutality thats been put against them some of them are  wounded a few of them draw weapons immediately and turning around you see hunkered down inside a  halforc that rushes around his hat halfkilter his coat up with his shoulder mantle part of his  collar pressed upward spins around puts his blade out  youve got to be kidding me scanlan shorthalt  sam thats me  /none/ matt as dr dranzel stands there before you  cheering  matt they themselves
