none	 time welcome for those of you who have been with us for the entire journey welcome as  well bunch of crazy voice actors here playing dd the party had just recently completed an  extensive quest through the underdark beneath the dwarven city of kraghammer in which they battled  with mind flayers and duergar and eventually a giant crazed beholder that was possessed by an  ancient artifact called the horn of orcus upon defeating the mind flayers and making a dramatic  escape thanks to tiberius back to their hometown of emon they met with the council 
none	 of taldorei  which theyre a part of to discuss what they should do with this great ancient evil artifact  the horn of orcus the council discussed it most of the knowledge seemed to be that it could not  or there is no known way to destroy it the best means of dealing with it would be to reseal it in  a place where it would be safe forgotten and hopefully never rediscovered it was decided  amongst the council that the safest place to do that is on the distant land of othanzia where  there 
none	 is a capital city known as vasselheim there supposedly is the most well known  holiest and oldest place of kimas order of worship of the great platinum dragon bahamut of  which shes a paladin and supposedly they have a facility or means of sealing it away so it was  decided that they would send away for a holy container that could contain this evil without any  worry of corruption or escape carry it then via skyship over the ocean to the distant land of  othanzia to vasselheim the capital city and seal it away after 
none	 which they went on a shopping  spree to gilmores glorious goods met everyones favorite mage magic creator extraordinaire  laura oh thats right i want some stuff give me stuff  matt yeah you guys have to figure out who gets what by the way  sam but we have to do this quickly  matt so bringing us back now youve completed your purchases now as a party decide how to  disseminate the items youve purchased and once you guys are ready well take it from there  sam okay how many items do we have  
none	 marisha well theyre a bit divvied up right now i believe pike is holding  onto the sword correct  ashley and i also have a pearl of power which is up for grabs  laura ooh what is that let me see let me see  marisha im holding on to a ring of protection plus two and a belt of dwarvenkind hello percy  taliesin oh hello  marisha hi  orion hello percy  marisha good of you to join us  taliesin thank you i just got off an airplane hi  marisha yes how was 
none	 your flight  orion an airplane  taliesin the flight was it was slightly shorter than the drive here hi  orion oh my god  marisha that sounds about right  taliesin this looks good  marisha please look what we got this is a gift from whats his  sam oh whatshisbutt has something  taliesin highpitched its really good  marisha its brandy its really good brandy  sam vax has something  laura vex hes vex  sam jesus  laura just kidding im vex cackles  liam i have a dagger of lifestealing plus one 
none	 id also like to say how much i enjoy being in  traviss stomach like uatu  all laugh  sam nice  matt love it  marisha i have a ring of protection plus two and a belt of dwarven  sam what is that what does that do  marisha it gives you a plus two bonus to ac and saving throws while wearing this ring  sam i need that  marisha and then i also have the belt of dwarvenkind  ashley did you say the most amazing thing about it  marisha the belt of 
none	 dwarvenkind  ashley yeah  marisha yeah you guys remember this it gives you a plus two to your constitution modifier you have  advantage on charismapersuasion checks with dwarves and you have a 50 chance each day at  dawn of growing a full beard  sam what  taliesin yeah  ashley i know  laura thats amazing  travis what  marisha if you are incapable of grow oh thats right because you guys tuned out  laura thats right we werent here  marisha yeah we realized this at the end of the stream at the 
none	 top of the day you have a 50  chance each day at dawn of growing a full thick beard if you are capable of growing one or a  visibly thicker beard if you already have one  travis wait tiberius is the only one that couldnt grow a beard right  laura right we could all grow a beard technically  travis the ladies could get some stank beards  sam can the ladies grow a beard  travis yeah  laura we could why not  ashley i mean if our hormones were a little different  
none	 travis yeah ive seen some nasty shebeards out there  taliesin we can find them a nice lady to date i think it would work out pretty well  marisha and if you arent a dwarf on top of this you gain the following additional benefits  while wearing this belt you have advantage on saving throws against poison resistance against  poison damage darkvision up to 60 feet you can speak read and write dwarvish  taliesin i got one too i got the manual of quickness of action  marisha that one you should keep  taliesin im 
none	 keeping this one  laura do you guys have a problem if i keep the pearl of power  sam what does it do  laura it lets you use another third spell slot 3rdlevel spell and i figure you guys all have  better spells than 3rdlevel but i only have up to 3rdlevel  sam so it just gives you one more 3rdlevel spell  laura of my most powerful spell which is my 3rdlevel  marisha thats just fine with me  laura and they usually do a lot of damage with the 3rdlevel  marisha thats 
none	 fine with me i generally have enough spell slots  laura you got that ring of protection or you can have the beardy thing  marisha so yes we also got the coldsnap leather armor plus two which i was originally thinking  for myself but then i realized i actually have decent leather armor that gives me spell  advantage so im good on leather armor  orion i could stand to wear it i have no torso armor  marisha i thought are you sure sorcerers can wear it i thought they could wear robes  orion cloth 
none	 and leather i mean i just  matt sorcerers can wear no armor you are wrong  orion i can wear no armor  matt no  orion i have this thing that somebody can use  liam wait i would just like to say creepily wade  sam thank you vax  marisha do you have any armor on scanlan  sam i have something  orion this would bring his with that and the ring if you wore this and the ring it would give you  plus three to your ac so thats not a bad combo 
none	 because this will give you plus one to your ac  matt you have regular studded leather armor right now  sam what is that how is that is this better  matt probably  marisha would that give him a plus two to his ac  matt coldsnap leather armor this would be leather armor plus two it would probably give  you an additional plus one to your ac if you wear it  sam plus one  matt its not studded leather its just leather but its plus two to the ac so yeah your ac  
none	 would go up by one  marisha who wants the belt of dwarvenkind grog whats your constitution right now  taliesin i think pike should have the belt  travis 18  laura thats pretty high  marisha constitution up to a 20  travis i want to grow a fucking beard i know it does other things but with a beard  ashley the only reason any of us want that belt is to grow a beard  marisha yeah thats true im not going to lie  ashley i mean even though theres some very great aspects to 
none	 the belt thats a plus  taliesin my question is once you grow the beard if you remove the belt does the beard fall off or  do you get to keep the beard because then you guys could just switch around until everyone had  the appropriate amount of facial hair  sam ill take the armor  marisha or does it dissipate at the end of the day when you take it off  laura i think thats our wonderful matt mercers call  travis ill take it we can hold it until somebody else wants it  
none	 matt you have no way of knowing  orion so whos going to take the ring  sam what does the ring do  laura keyleth i think would like the ring  marisha i would just like something to help my ac  sam whats your ac  marisha 15  orion that would bring you to 17  sam mines a 14  matt it is now 15 with your new armor  sam 15 all right you take it ill just die a lot  travis whoa whoa no not cool  marisha are you sure id 
none	 feel bad  taliesin i wouldnt  ashley hey scanlan whats your constitution  sam 15  ashley youd look pretty good with a beard  laura you would look really good with a beard  taliesin well that solves it  sam well wait i thought grog was taking the beard  ashley grog has it maybe you guys can switch out sometimes  sam take it its a belt we can just oh but we have to bind it to us  travis you can have it  sam no no you take it  marisha because grog 
none	 doesnt wear armor either he has better benefits if he doesnt wear armor  taliesin there hasnt been enough ingame time for this to have actually taken hold yet  has there  marisha you keep take that i think it gives you a bonus to your dex  taliesin the manual of quickness of action it takes 48 hours worth of reading it  matt not yet  taliesin okay so ill have to wait im starting this  matt you can read it over time like take a couple hours out of each evening then  marisha but 
none	 that means everybody got something right  orion yes  laura yes  marisha did we divide it up that way  sam we divide everything up  orion yes  laura the only one who didnt is my brother  liam no i have a dagger of lifestealing which steals life  orion and also scanlan and i bring out the ioun stone  sam oh yes  orion like i was saying before you ran out of you kept running out of spells this allows you to  store extra spells i propose a friendly trade for the 
none	 crown circlet hat  whatever youre wearing  laura the circlet with the hat  orion is it a circlet  sam the concentration circlet  orion yes i think it would benefit you to have the ring some sort of spell storing which youve  complained about running out of spells the last few times weve fought  laura oh sorry sorry i took that pearl and you wanted it huh  sam the pearl yes i did want the pearl but what confused laugh  marisha it does what the pearl does but times three  sam what 
none	 does it do  matt it allows you to cast a spell into it up to a level three you can do three 1stlevel spells  or up to one 3rdlevel spell into the stone itll hold it and then you can continue on with  the next few days and you can cast it from the stone for free  orion you know how i keep casting i keep hucking spells because i keep casting them  out of my ioun stone  sam so does that mean on one round i could cast a spell and also activate 
none	 the spell  thats stored in there  matt its still an action to activate it but it doesnt use your current spell slot cause youve  already stored it in there the day before  sam ive never run out of spells  orion you ran out of spells the last two battles and you said that i cant cast this anymore  where youve  sam so it gives me an extra level three slot  matt essentially if you were to cast a level three spell into it in advance  orion or you can cast like 
none	 three of those or three of those things that you would use for  other deals  matt essentially its up to you you have the crown  sam let me think about it lets think about it and strategize well do this tonight the three  level spells i dont use as much as these but if thats what youd like  orion i would like that very very much  travis has vax come back from his man date  laura yeah are we done are we ready to do things now  taliesin ive been looking forward 
none	 to that conversation for two weeks  marisha its true giggles that is a true story  taliesin its been sitting going maybe hell say this i dont know  sam well you did silence me that time  orion i had to  sam you didnt have to  taliesin you did turn him into a mouse  sam he liked it  laura yeah a super cute mouse  orion no i no i was going to say you didnt turn me back into a mouse  sam you also abandoned the party in our most dire moments 
none	  laura this is true as well  taliesin but he then did get the killing blow  travis true  laura that doesnt add to  sam yes so if i abandon you all and come in at the last minute and take the last shot i get all  the credit i dont think so  taliesin i like to be contrary  orion to be fair gnome i never abandoned the party at all i was surveying the situation my  idea was not tried whatsoever so i merely kept to my word i did not enter 
none	 the premises only when i  needed to save everyones life which is exactly what i did  sam im so sorry i missed the last part because my awesome hat was blocking it sorry  travis oh yeah  orion its too big youre saying you cant wear it  sam well discuss soon  orion thats not clarotas thing thats a different thing right  matt yeah that vax has  liam yes i have the clarota hat  orion and we still have that  laura and it looks wonderful on you  taliesin you look like 
town	 merlin from excalibur  travis are we still at gilmores  matt you guys have exited gilmores at this time  laura are we standing out on the street divvying up random items  matt yes you guys are essentially in the middle of the thoroughfare in abadars promenade of  emon bickering over the items you guys are distributing amongst  yourselves in broad daylight  laura well ive got a beautiful pearl so im happy  taliesin ive got a book  travis are there any shady characters making eyes at our goods  matt make a perception 
none	 check  travis me make a perception check  matt yes  laura bust out those dice  travis 15 plus probably crap zero  matt laughs looking about there are a few folks that walk by and give a strange eye to the  seven nearly eight foot tall goliath but nothing beyond what youre used to  travis oh all right  matt yeah as a note guys you do have about two days before the holy receptacle arrives so if  theres anything that you want to achieve in that meantime youre welcome to do so or 
none	 you can just  spend that couple days and relax  laura what im sorry percy are you talking  taliesin i have chicken  travis on you  taliesin i have some tinkering id like to do  matt all right what would you like to tinker  taliesin i would like to try and build a couple things i have a list actually  laura arrows arrows for me please darling  taliesin no no arrows are on the list i want to start working on some sort of tazing implement  for direct contact i want to 
none	 do an electrical charge that i can rev up  marisha he wants to make asamis glove  matt okay  taliesin theres that i have a list of things how many things can i start  poking with in two days  matt that glove thats going to be like a  weeklong endeavor  taliesin thats a weeklong thing  matt even the design phase will take you about two days acquiring materials  taliesin night vision  matt night vision  taliesin into my current existing helmet  matt night vision or darkvision as you would put 
dung	 it would be more of an  enchantmentbased acquisition  taliesin theres no way that i could try to pull that together  matt not via tinkering  taliesin damn it  matt the technological aspects are not unfortunately that advanced in this time like  shades probably you could probably shade some sun but actually looking in the dark thats an  actual would be more of an arcane situation  taliesin so this boils me down to two thoughts this is good i want to put a  slight dent into the barrel of bad news to get 
none	 a ricochet shot so that it basically allows me  when i shoot a bullet to also do 1d12 worth of damage to one target that is immediately adjacent  to the main target  marisha shrapnel  taliesin shrapnel its not quite shrapnel its a ricochet but yes it is basically a  shrapnel shot  orion like a bank shot  taliesin yeah like a bank shot a secondary lesser damage  matt with the bad news its going to be difficult with the bad news because the sheer  power and force that that gun emits on 
none	 its payload  taliesin would it be possible if i did it to one of the barrels of  matt you could do it id say itd probably up your misfire rate by one  taliesin ah okay  matt so consider that its doable but in messing with the barrel the chamber and the  trajectory of the weapon there is that slight increase in the possibility of it jamming or  disabling  taliesin okay  matt its a possible tradeoff with bad news because it travels so fast to do that much damage  any sort of 
none	 alteration it will either not change the course whatsoever or itll blow up the gun  taliesin ill start the taser and work on some arrows then thats what id like to do  matt okay arrows are viable  sam i go back into gilmores and i ask if theres if either they or someone else they know  can make a specific kind of potion  marisha oh i actually join him  matt all right so the two of you walk back in as theyre discussing this  gilmore is still at his desk  orion im 
none	 going too  matt all right im sorry was there something else you require  sam i forgot to ask hello gilmore  matt hello  sam you look particularly perky today  matt ive had a rather good day you could say  sam i was wondering if i could inquire about a specific kind of scrying potion that i would like  made for me its a specialty item i dont know if any exist  matt please do step into my office and he leads you into the back room beyond the beaded  curtain laughs  
none	 sam oh is that patchouli i smell  matt quite an astute nose you have ill be right in if you dont mind just hanging tight  just for a moment thank you he steps off in the back room and takes about five minutes  marisha while hes gone can i look around to see if he has any books on how to start like a  potion making for dummies book  matt okay so  sam gilmore when we get excited i well never mind that anyway im looking for a way a potion  that i 
dung	 could maybe drink or use to help me look in on a place that weve been to recently i could  maybe leave a mark of some sort and then use that mark to magically scry into that place  matt he gives you a long hard look contemplating the conversation and then you see a  lightbulb go off in his eyes and he goes hmm curious youre into some things  laughter  sam i have a dark side  matt indeed i could probably acquiesce to this give me a day i should be able to produce 
none	 such an  item although this is i will say having not been attempted there comes a warning of possible  side effects  sam so i would be drinking this potion and it could affect me in other ways  matt perhaps the funny thing about unproven magic is well its unproven i could give you at  least a 90 to 95 guarantee  sam all right and how much would such a potion cost me  matt i would say for the research the materials and seeing as how you are indeed  sponsored by gilmores glorious 
dung	 goods at discount 300 gold  sam wow did i give away my ruby last time  laura i dont remember  orion no you still have it  travis you did not  sam how much would this get me  matt go ahead and roll a persuasion  travis come on buddy  sam i dont have any dice laughs  matt there you go  liam i almost gave away mine  sam 23  ashley thats a good one  sam oh 21  laura oh  matt right oh laughs no as soon as you 
none	 procure it he leans forward and snatches it gingerly  from your fingers and looks it over in his eyes ooh this is a fine piece  laura whispering its superduper flawless  cause you put it in the wheel  matt for trade  sam just tell me how much its worth first  matt this gem would probably run you anywhere from 200 to 300 gold  sam do i sense that hes lying  matt make an insight check  sam whered it go thank you ooh 11  laughter  matt he seems honest he seems 
none	 like hes genuinely looking to make a deal  travis do it  sam what  travis just straight up  laura do it  sam yeah lets do it ill give you the ruby for the potion  matt very well  sam but i would love a hefty amount of a potion not a single use but multiple use  matt oh i can provide for this fantastic specimen a three use potion is that within your  realm of possibility  sam that would be lovely thank you gilmore  matt one day  sam one one 
none	 wonderful day  matt one day  sam one glorious day  matt and he rubs your shoulder and leads you outside of the room  orion wait i have a two part question gilmore  laura i didnt even think you were in there  orion i am  laura oh okay  matt ha ha as you storm through the beaded curtain as hes exiting ah im sorry this  room is private  orion oh everythings private i guess  laughter  orion i wanted to know a how much that ring of walking on water was 
none	 again and b if you knew of  somewhere that i could have an existing item enchanted just a little bit like make it stronger  than it currently is but not change it  matt first off the ring that we discussed as our original deal the price would run you  about 1750  orion 1750  matt 1750 gold pieces should you be interested still as for enchantment is a largely permanent  process to enhance an existing enchantment is a dangerous task that has a very high probability of  ruining the enchantment that currently exists 
none	  orion oh thats good to know  matt to increase it such masters i hear exist in the world but they are very very dead or  very very hidden  orion hmm yes  matt however if you wish to upgrade we are more than happy to oblige  orion no the ring of protection that i have is one measure i wanted it by another measure  i dont know how to phrase this in rp so i wanted it to be to have  sam more  marisha more protecty  sam more bigger  marisha 
none	 more yes  matt well perhaps we could have one made for you it would take a few weeks but we could have  one waiting  orion oh very good i would like to arrange that  matt all right well youd have to pay half the price down in front how much is your ring of  protection plus two currently labeled as  marisha 6500  orion man  matt so 6500 that will put you at 3250 down now the other half when the enchantment is  complete  orion quietly that is insane we didnt 
none	 buy it for that much did we  matt they haggled it down a little bit  marisha we tossed it in with a deal and stuff  taliesin stuffs expensive man  marisha stuff is expensive  orion ill chill for now  matt very well come back if you change your mind  orion i will  marisha wait did i find a book  matt right well get to that now roll an investigation check  marisha 18  matt all right asking around some of the employees and keeping an eye out there are a few 
none	  books on herbalism how to find and retain the potent elements of various material components  found in nature also there are some bits of information about how to extract materials from  natural creatures meaning monsters beasts both natural and magical how to remove and preserve  safely elements of their organs and things that can be used in various alchemical compounds andor  potionbrewing there are no books specifically on the process of brewing but that is one of the key  components to it is being able to acquire those elements  marisha so i take 
none	 those books how much are those books  matt its a single book that contains everything about the herbalism and a book about the  extraction of creature components  marisha so i take that book how much is that book  matt the two books  marisha how much are these books  matt laughs you inquire with the employees these books are marked currently at 25 gold  apiece they are a second printing but hard to find do you wish to purchase  marisha yes ill take both of them 50 gold  matt mark off 50 
town	 gold hands the tomes back  marisha also did i talk to gilmore about potion classes  matt you did and he said hell take it under consideration  marisha hell take it into consideration okay  matt he gave you a look like hm  marisha like maybe okay  taliesin its tough to tell he sort of has that look  laura without taking too long on it i was also hoping while were in town that armor that we  stole from the big rhinoceros monster in the duergar castle  matt oh the bulette  laura 
town	 yes the armor that we took from him is there any way i can find a blacksmith that can  maybe upgrade trinkets armor with that  sam ooh  matt thats an interesting thought all right go ahead and make an investigation check  laura okay all right here we go pick wisely im using the new fancy one so dont fail me  marisha singing dont fail me now  laura 20  matt 20 easy enough after asking around town you manage to find a few individuals to speak  with there are two armor smiths one 
none	 that dabbles in both blacksmithing and armor smithing one that  specifically is an armor smith who focuses in strange materials mostly ornamental but has a  strong history and past in warfare and honing those skills towards the use of actual battle you  find its a dwarven woman by the name of karin and they send you to her facility its a very  small almost a hovel but when you approach the outside you can immediately smell this strong  scent of iron almost like a sulfur and different other chemicals that are used when youre folding 
none	 metals  and making composites you open the door slightly and its very darkly lit on the inside theres  the heat of the forge and you see this very sturdy muscular dwarven woman standing in there  with her hair graying and its pulled back into a very tight bun shes wearing a leather apron with  her sleeves rolled up and shes in the process of hammering down on a piece of metal over her anvil  just ping ting ting  laura does she have a beard  matt laughs you see theres probably a bit of 
none	 scruff showing at the edge of her chin but not a  beard per se she doesnt seem to notice you shes just in the middle of her work  laura clears throat  matt she stops for a second oh sorry i didnt see you enter can i help you  laura karin yes  matt aye im karin  laura dont mean to interrupt you look very busy here  matt let me just finish  laura all right  matt she gives you a nod huffs and then goes back into her mode for a second she 
none	 makes you  wait for a good six minutes while she finishes hammering out this piece turning and rotating on  the edge of the anvil hammering it into this smooth it looks almost like a pauldron curved  point for a shoulder then eventually she shhh quenches it in the trough sets it aside with a  tink tink puts her tools down takes off her big leather gloves wipes her brow and you see  when she wipes it she wipes the sweat off but leaves a big old grease mark where once was clean  and goes 
none	 sorry for the wait so what can i do for you  laura ive heard rumor that you are a very talented blacksmith  matt oh aye depends on what youre looking for whatre you putting in the furnace  laura i have quite an interesting proposition for you  matt i like interesting  laura i may have some material youve never worked with i dont know  liam oh here we go  laura would you mind stepping outside for a moment get some fresh air  matt at this point specifically she goes from extremely welcoming to 
none	 a very nervous untrusting look  laura believe me youll want to see this  matt make a persuasion roll  travis why didnt you wink first  laura youll want to see this  matt laughs  laura ugh i dont know which thats the problem with having too many im rolling my  trinket die since it applies to trinket  matt there you go  laura that wasnt good nine  matt its okay she rolled a two  laura yay  matt all right all right sorry i dont mean to ive had a few encounters 
none	 in the past  laura oh  matt but yes outside she walks out and as she walks out with you you can see she reaches  over and grabs a sheathed shortsword and keeps it at her side  laura no need for that darling trinket  matt bear moans your armored bear comes looming around the corner at which point she yelps goes  for the sword instinctually  laura no no take a gander at his armor  matt oh thats not bad thats not bad at all she walks up to him and carefully doesnt want 
none	  to touch him  laura hes friendly dont worry  matt trinket of course leans forward slurp licks the side of her face cleaning off some of  the grease stain on the side of her cheek shocked laughter oh that was unexpected very  friendly one  liam matt mercer  matt trinket is it  laura yes  matt youre a nice one trinket she starts rubbing the side of his cheek bear moans  laura he likes you i can tell  matt she starts looking at the armor its nice functional its taken a few 
none	 dings its seen some  battle  laura yes it has im hoping to protect him a bit more however  matt well i can see that who made this she looks around and pulls it oh this is the mark  of westruun this was made over in that scoffs  laura yes you can do better im sure  matt oh theyre not the finest over there theyre functional but not the finest is this  for a parade or is this for actual combat  laura actual combat beauty not my concern  matt all right all 
none	 right and what materials are you looking for  laura well grunts  matt laughs as you slam down this awkward still somewhat wet in places but mostly driedout  bulette hide that you guys carved from it and it is big pieces of plate scales with sections of  leather underneath interwoven it is part of a large behemoth of a creature as you slam it down  she steps back for a second and you what manner of creature did this come from  laura a very large one actually a bull  matt bulette  laura bulette 
none	 that one  matt oh i havent seen one of those found itself to the surface in quite some time  laura it wasnt on the surface were a bit of adventurers if you want to know  matt she gives you this long look goes right right adventurers of course sorry didnt mean  to offend  laura youve probably heard of us vox machina  matt she stops for a second and goes actually yes i have heard of you  laura yeah  matt winters crest festival not long ago  laura that is correct  matt 
none	 all right well then its a pleasure to have you in my little establishment and business  bulette hide i have not worked with this she leans down and starts messing with it seeing how  pliable it is in sections she goes theres enough here to redo most of the armor most  places i could minimize spatial use of it and possibly get most of the main plates gathered i  can work with this  laura nice  matt i can work with this itll take me a few days unfortunately it is a rare material  
none	 laura right is two days enough  matt two days  laura yes  matt i could id have to charge you more cause im not going to get much sleep at that rate  laura understandable how much is a bit more  matt well youre providing the materials that definitely cuts the cost significantly for my  time and work and lack of sleep  laura and we will send many many customers your way  matt can i put my personal brand on this  laura of course  orion wait  matt well then youre not 
none	 there  laura whispering trinket isnt sponsored its just fucking us  orion okay  matt 500 gold suffice  laura how about 450  matt make a persuasion roll  laura shit  matt oh vex  sam why must you dicker  laura because i want to  ashley yeah  laura wahwah that would be 26  matt she looks you over for a second looks at the material and you can see in her eyes theres  this interest in working with this material never touched or worked with it she goes  spits 450  
none	 laura spits deal  matt shakes hands  laura see you in a few days  matt all right  laura two days  matt two days all right and she leans down picks it up it is heavy material for the most  part carrying it around was his job in the bag of holding she lifts it over one shoulder rgh  heads right into the workshop  laura thank you karin  matt stops for a second turns around do you mind if i take that armor in the meantime i  figure i could use that 
none	 to base the pattern  laura oh of course yeah use it together trinket  matt take about 15 minutes she helps take the armor off she leads it all into the shop and she  goes all right see you in a few days closes her door bff  laura trinket look at you naked so cute all right sorry that took so long  sam hi youre back all right shall we start adventuring then  orion where theres two days to hang out  sam two days oh were not leaving yet  laura no  sam 
none	 i was mostly spacing out last time  matt if theres anything else you guys want to achieve in these next two days youre welcome to  do it now or we could go ahead and say you relax and take the time to fastforward through the  twoday period  taliesin ill do my tinkering rolls and then im good  matt all right so first you wanted to work on  taliesin i wanted to work on a grapplinghook arrow that attaches to the unending that ties to  the unending rope so that we have actually something 
none	 that will pierce  heavy stone and anchor  matt okay all right  taliesin like batman i dont know why batmans on the brain right now could be any reason  matt all right  orion i have an earring of the wind that i made that i have not enchanted yet can i enchant that  in two days to make another one  matt another one of the speaking earrings  orion there is the existing functional one but over the time since i gave them out i only had  time to make one extra one 
none	 but i have to enchant them also  matt yeah i would say you could begin the process you get halfway through it would take you the better  part of a week to complete the earring which is what it did before when you first made them but  you can begin the process you definitely have your laboratory now in greyskull keep and that  gives you a bonus to the rolls you make to enchant it  orion ooh can i start it and then if we leave i can have one of the helpers  matt 
none	 you could probably have allura come and finish it if you wanted to ask her  orion oh okay well cool then  matt she doesnt have anything better to do laughs  orion ill start that yeah ill start doing the one that i made  matt okay getting the enchantment on that all right go ahead and make your  first tinkering check  taliesin all right first tinkering roll is 13  matt 13 okay so as opposed to an actual arrow what youre doing is you take an extended crossbow  bolt you blacksmith onto the 
none	 end of it extending it to what would be an actual fullscale longbow  arrow length but it is a thick metal rod from there you create the grappling hook end to it and  what would be essentially its thin and then once the rope is pulled or tugged from the back  it retracts the front part to extend it into a grappling hook you get through the process of  creating the rod and you sketch in a few ideas for the actual portion of the end of the arrow  that would extend into the grappling 
none	 hook portion go ahead and make a secondary roll  taliesin 12  matt 12 okay youre having this is including your tinker bonus your  taliesin just proficiency bonus  matt yeah so you started having a little bit of a problem with the mechanism it keeps sticking  and having a hard time actually retracting or springing from the arrow point  taliesin damn it  matt it takes a little more time than you anticipated with it go ahead and  make a final roll  sam im going to inspire him before he makes this roll 
none	 with a little inspiration song or something  matt so scanlan comes down into your workshop underneath greyskull keep you hear a fine little  ditty to inspire you in your work  sam sings whoa i hear youre tinkering whoa please do it well take my hand and youll  tinker i swear  all sing whoa please do it well  laughter  taliesin i feel inspired  sam sing tinkering on a prayer  taliesin there we go now i feel inspired  matt i was about to give you a d6 but thatll be the full 
none	 d10 so on this final roll go ahead  and what did you roll initially  taliesin i actually dont even remember but it wasnt that bad  matt all right go  taliesin all right so thats 18  matt 18 okay with that bit of inspiration going in your little scanlanbased soundtrack  taliesin sings tinkering on a prayer  matt  you realize that some of the gears that were sticking you recut them out insert it and  like butter shnk it sticks out and retracts so you have one grappling arrow completed for  material 
none	 costs it came to about 100 gold  taliesin 100 gold and then i want to try and recreate the exploding arrow as my last little  thing i want to do today  matt okay okay  marisha guys weve got to go back and get our money  laura yeah oh my gosh  travis yeah no shit  orion thats what weve got to do  marisha that is like 30k sitting for us in  sam can we just send our minions to get it like our servants  travis vax has something hed like to 
none	 add  laura what  liam pike dear dear friend can you hear me  ashley oh yes i know were getting to that  liam i was wondering if maybe you and i could swing by the temple of serrenrae and  fix my foot  travis and laura saran wrap  ashley oh its sarenrae but thats fine  liam im threefourths an atheist darling but i know that my foot doesnt fucking work  ashley well i know and i was going to say the past couple days i think ive spent at the temple  trying 
none	 to sort of reconnect and really just tune in and apologize and confess  taliesin sounds like a day spa  laura ooh thats good  matt and you return to this temple the same temple where you yourself were resurrected after  falling to the treachery demon naught but eight months previous returning to that place  especially after your recent journey and near brushes with death again is a very solemn  experience and theres a part of you that just feels internally cold both returning there and  because of your strangely fractured connection with sarenrae since 
none	 you delved into the underdark  and tapped into your darker side since traveling abroad on the ship you take approximately six  hours out of each day to just go in silent prayer and reach out to her i will say go ahead and  make a wisdom check  ashley okay  laura ooh thats good  ashley 22  matt at the end of your second sixhour period of intense  sam and marisha six hours  marisha its like an ayahuasca experience  sam did you have a bathroom break  matt  intense communion with 
none	 sarenrae sweat pouring down your body the room itself is pretty  cold but for some reason your body is just growing more and more intense with heat you feel  yourself internalizing all of the steps and missteps that youve gone through over these past  six or seven months trying to find your path rediscovering yourself and what you have to do to  prevent yourself or any of your friends from falling to the fate that you once did and  explaining to her that your love never left and that this was all with the ultimate 
none	 purpose of  achieving her ultimate purpose as her instrument and you wish not to cross that again and if  theres any way to redeem yourself to let it be known to you at the end of that period of time  you feel since youve lost that connection in the underdark that thread reconnect the warmth fills  you and the sweat stops as your entire body seems to be humming with energy for a brief second in  your face in your eyes in your vision you can see the beautiful gold gleaming firewreathed  head of 
none	 sarenrae smiling at you as she reaches down and touches the side of your cheek and says  be forthright be grand burn bright and beautiful and i shall always be at your side  and with that she releases your cheek and vanishes the vision gone in the temple and you  can see two other clerics that were silent muttering prayer have gone quiet and are both  staring at you with a look of like what just happened  laura yay pike yay  ashley yay yay yay  matt you look down at your holy symbol 
none	 and that one giant fissure that had cracked  has resealed itself  all cheer  ashley hey man that was my new special celtic die that whoever sent to me  laura yep  liam celebrate by shitting on a bed  all laugh  matt its a cultural gnome thing right  ashley so well to start things off then how is liams foot  sam whose  matt its going okay  sam who  ashley im so sorry  matt whos this liam guy  ashley im what am i saying i mean how is vaxs 
none	 foot im not sure who liam is  matt as you step out  liam my foots great ashley thanks  all laugh  matt as you step out of the central chamber of the temple of sarenrae vax has been waiting there  for a while wanted to actually ask for your aid in this as you see her step out of the main  chamber vax she has a look of serenity in her face you havent seen in quite some time  liam is this the moment  ashley hi  liam should i take my shoe 
none	 off vex look ill take my shoe off  laura dont do it dont do it  ashley here just sit on this rock okay take off your shoe hoo  taliesin for the first time youre safe  matt and he does  laura ugh thats disgusting  travis proud of you right now  liam its still you know it feels strong but its it itches it itches me it irks me still  perhaps maybe you could give it one more try today you seem to have a bit  of a glow about you  ashley 
none	 30  matt thats a 30 30 points of healing as youre saying this and youre stuttering this out she  goes into a singular trance clutches her holy symbol with one hand and reaches out and grabs  your foot with the other her hand almost burns at the touch something you instinctively pull back  on but her grip is like an iron vice and you cannot release yourself from it and as she just  intensely focuses forward you can see this glowing divine energy transfer from down her  forearm into your foot fear reaches you 
none	 suddenly because you dont understand the divine and  though youve seen some crazy things this is a little worrying youve seen some shit i want you  to go ahead and make a medicine roll with advantage  liam it feels like icyhot  laughter  taliesin ye olde icyhot  matt the scent of vicks vaporub hits your system  laura and another one you get advantage you can do it again  ashley thats a lot better 24  matt 24 as she releases her grip on you the energy fades her eyes tend to come back 
none	 into that  natural soft pike image youre used to and looking down at your foot you can see any  noticeable sign of scarring damage is completely gone your foot is whole intact  cheering  sam and your nails have been painted red red nails  laura hey and you know what it doesnt smell as bad now  liam i stick my foot in my sisters face  laura yeah thank you  orion im going to miss that bit  laura it doesnt even smell bad anymore so thank you  liam well not so fast 
none	  matt percy  taliesin yes  matt how many you have time probably to attempt three arrows  taliesin im going to try for three exploding arrows and ive built one before  matt yes you have i know im still keeping that in mind  taliesin thank you  matt materials per arrow will cost 50 gold  taliesin another 150 gold all right  laura ill give it to you  matt so 150 gold for materials you have your goggles on  laura i wont even haggle with you percy ill just give it to you 
none	 i mean well you know you  know what i mean  taliesin i certainly do i know exactly what you mean no  liam thats going a bit beyond winking  laura laughs i know  taliesin now im nervous  matt so coming off the high from making your grappling arrow you sit down youre alone in the  middle of your workshop its hot in there its subterranean you have the glow of your  candlelight around you you have your goggles on your blacksmith leather gloves on and youre  tinkering with the delivery method of 
none	 these small concussive arrows go ahead and  make your first roll  taliesin 18  matt 18 with deftness you rapidly complete the first arrow wrapping up the powder charge the  impact point and the arrow itself weighted to be fair and balanced to be flung from a longbow make  your second roll  sam like fox news  taliesin all right 15  matt 15 second arrow takes a little longer but you still manage to keep the flow going complete  it fine third and final roll  laura come on percy  taliesin natural 
none	 20  cheering  laura thats an extraspecial arrow  matt not only did you complete this in record time but the arrow itself looks beautiful it  could be a display case item  laura does it do extra damage  matt youll find out but i would mark that arrow separately from the other two  taliesin you would mark it  matt mark it as two exploding arrows and one exploding arrow with a star next to it  laura okay ill do that  taliesin so you have a grappling hook arrow two exploding arrows and 
tavern	 one exploding arrow  with a star  laura come here you beautiful bastard  taliesin im getting to kiss everybody in this game ive already made my way through siblings  this is getting all right  marisha thats so true you have  matt ah youve been to that party before  taliesin ive kissed the twins i have well thank you  matt all right any other business you guys wish to  travis yeah is there a tavern nearby just a quick question  matt there are many taverns the one you know the best is 
none	 the laughing lamia which you guys  previously stayed at  travis its the biggest one  matt its pretty large its pretty large  travis id like to walk to the laughing lamia and knock the doors open and as loud as i can go  listen up i want to know if anyone has seen any goliaths wandering around these parts  aside from me  matt do you wish to do this via conversational persuasion or through intimidation because there  are two ways you can go with this grog  laura and youre wearing the belt 
none	 that makes you extra persuasive  marisha only with dwarves  travis persuasive yeah well maybe theres some dwarves hanging about  marisha there might be some dwarves  matt so how are you doing this okay make a persuasion roll  sam can i be with him just to watch  laura was there also a grappling arrow percy  matt sure  sam okay im with you grog just watching  orion im still enchanting  taliesin possibly reusable  laura ooh  liam yeah you are  marisha can i go read my potion book  travis 
none	 i got a four with the belt  laughter  matt this is  marisha what dice are you rolling  travis i grow a giant pubic mane from the belt  matt enchanted merkin plus two  orion dude youve got to check your balanced dice man  matt all right so as you burst in and shout this to the group everyone stops and turns and  looks and then goes right back to drinking and their conversation there appears to be no  immediate reaction  sam can i jump up i jump up on a table 
none	 and i say listen you motherfuckers my friend just asked  you a fucking question now fucking answer him or im going to kill every last  motherfucking one of you  travis id listen to him he means it  laura can you do that  matt make an intimidation check  travis yeah yeah  sam is this a 20  ashley come on scanlan  laura please be good  ashley come on scanlan  sam i rolled that would be a 30  travis thug life thats amazing  sam oh wait no yes 28 i 
tavern	 added wrong 28  matt oh well that makes the difference so in an unseen display the goliath storms into the bar  and makes no impact yet the tiniest gnome jumps onto the table like a ravenous wolverine frothing  at the mouth his wild eyes staring about the dark interior of the laughing lamia all the patrons at  the table around him you can see lean back in fear caught offguard by this entirely one man  holding a drink just drops it and you hear it shatter on the ground everyone gets quiet again  but 
none	 stays quiet even the small band playing in the far corner you hear like geeuh a  discordant sound as all instruments break to a halt the dancer stops the whole room is  deadsilent at which point a nearby halfling you can see hes unkempt farmertan looking fellow  looks up and he goes um no  sam thank you for your forthrightness and honesty  matt at which point a hand claps your shoulder you look over and theres a human there a bearded  older man in his 40s his hair trimmed very very short crewcut almost 
dung	 hes wearing what looks  like a patchwork scalemail almost like mostly leather but theres a lot of chunks of scales put  around it and he looks scarred and weathered and he says ive traveled this land quite a bit and  ive heard theres roving bands of goliaths been attacking folks up north in trade routes havent  seen any near emon where occasionally youd hear of the mountainfolks staying up north it appears  theyre getting brazen wandering southward havent seen them myself but a friend of mine had  an encounter once lost half his traveling 
tavern	 crew had to bury them out there it was terrible  sam sounds awful you said up north how far  matt just in the silvercoat runway the way south of kraghammer on the way to westruun  sam all right anything else youd like to know grog  travis no killer  sam thank you for your troubles here let me buy you a drink  matt all right ill take that and he goes over walks with you to the bar toss him a gold  he gets his ale and you know ive always shat on gnomes 
none	 but today i think youve represented  them well  sam you my friend have good taste  travis that was awesome  i had no idea that was amazing scanlan  sam for you anything hey grow a beard tomorrow morning  travis okay  matt all right so well say over the period of two days go by grog  whats the percentage on your  travis 50 chance  matt go ahead and roll a percentile dice  sam oh weve never done one of those before  laura oh percentile dice  travis that a 20 
none	  laura no a percentile dice  sam no its a percentile dice  matt its two tensiders there should be one that has doubledigits and one that has single  travis both of them  matt yeah  sam no just one  travis 60  matt 60 then roll another one  sam oh  travis double zeroes  laura 100 thats a 100  matt right well that was a 60 and then that was for the second digit so you rolled a 60  travis okay good  matt all right so over the period of 
none	 the next morning you wake up excited and check smooth as  a babys bum  travis shit  matt however as the twoday period comes to an end you guys acquire early in the morning that  morning as you finish your breakfast a messenger comes to the front of greyskull keep and delivers  a summons to the council of taldorei that notifies you that the package has arrived at the  council very very quick to the point words not very verbose in the idea of keeping it vague and  secret but you know what it 
none	 means  sam do you think its the model plane i ordered  laura i think it is yes  travis probably not  sam oh  travis just a guess though  laura well should we go  matt so mark down that you spent two of four days of enchanting on that second earring and you can  get back to that if you manage to find yourself to some sort of a laboratory elsewhere or you can  return to your  orion can we stop at is allura is she here or not  travis allura 
none	  matt allura she might be in the cloudtop district in her tower you can inquire  orion and do we does she have helpers there when we were there do you remember  matt no she was just herself  orion it was just herself  matt she runs it herself  orion okay  sam in the last two days have i gone back to gilmore to pick up my item  matt you got back your item was completed  sam excellent  ashley what kind of potion did you get  sam its a potion that 
none	 when combined with when consumed can allow me to leave a mark of some  sort that possibly i could use to have visions of what is in the area the mechanics of which i  would not like to get into at this moment  matt so he gives you the potion it was a curious endeavor but i think youll be happy with  the results  laura its so he can spy on you  sam any chance to talk to you gilmore leaves me happy beyond compare  matt oh stop it flattery will get you 
none	 everywhere  travis if you have an erection for more than 24 hours  laura did you get that potion so you can spy on pike when shes naked  sam i am offended and terrified at the assumption that i would sink so low  laura yeah yeah  sam as to spy on my good friend and future wife pike when her pantaloons are down not at all how  dare you how dare you have i ever spied  laura yes  sam on a member of our current party  laura yes you have  ashley 
none	 yes  orion no  sam current party  laura yes  sam okay okay  laughter  travis tiberius can you bamf us to the place  sam i just wanted to make sure you remembered  laura good i do  orion it doesnt work like that i can bamf us back here when were done  matt all right so youve acquired your potion its a brackish purple color its a purplegrey  sam purplegrey okay ive got it great thank you  matt you go back to karin and indeed the armor is completed its interesting 
none	 it makes trinket look  like a rolypoly almost  all ooh  laura oh thats so cute  matt its these overlaid giant grey scales that overlap in armored sections and you would imagine  if you wanted could roll in a ball and she would look adorable he would but yeah  its the armor  laura you really really want trinket to be a girl  matt i dont know why ive got it in my head i dont you know what it is its because my bird i  thought was a boy for the longest 
none	 time and we found out the bird was a girl and so i got used  to transitioning to she when i talk about animals since then i apologize  laura oh i see understandable  matt trinket is a boy  laura boy and maybe he could roll into things now itll be awesome  marisha yeah can he roll  matt well try it if you want to  marisha rolypoly bear  matt bears arent known for their rolling capabilities  laura trinket is a special bear  orion how much does trinket weigh again like 600 
none	 pounds  laura he weighs a lot  taliesin call it a bearrel roll  orion hes not over a thousand pounds though is it 800 pounds  matt trinkets pushing about 800 pounds probably  orion hes 800 pounds so  laura he weighs more than grog  orion i can fastball special him  laura gasps fastball special trinket  matt so the benefits of this trinket acquires an additional plus two to trinkets armor class over  his previous armor which he gains from the bulette  laura that puts him at 20  matt thats fantastic 
none	 also trinket has resistance against nonmagical bludgeoning  damage  laura awesome  matt so if anyone attempts to go after trinket with a giant hammer or you know something that is  bludgeontype damage  orion or a mace  matt  or a giant mace anything if i ever attack trinket with something that seems  bludgeoning and you say ahah is that bludgeoning call me on it and it could be reduced  by half  sam what if someone tries to  laura so if i did try to roll him into something it wouldnt hurt 
none	 him  matt not as much  laura  because that would technically be bludgeoning  matt in theory yeah  laura okay  matt hitting the wall trinket would be like all right  sam what if someone tried to hit trinket with a salmon  orion thats also bludgeoning  matt thats fish damage its a different arcane type of damage fire lightning fish its a  whole thing  laura lets go see the council  sam lets go all right to the council  marisha did i learn anything from my herbalism book  matt what 
none	 the books are is you keep them with you and if you wish to reference them while  taking any sort of herbalism roll they will essentially give you a momentary bonus to it they  will double your proficiency bonus for any rolls for herbalism or to harvest  any pieces of a creature  marisha dope  matt so keep that in mind  travis dope  marisha dope  sam all right  travis so lets go  sam lets go to the council  matt are you proficient in herbalism  marisha huh  matt are 
none	 you proficient in herbalism or medicine i guess it would be now sorry herbalism is  sorry thats old systems  marisha i mean im proficient in nature  matt well say nature itd be nature ive run too many systems too many games so well say  are you proficient in nature  marisha yeah druid yo  matt so you double your proficiency bonus on any nature rolls to do either of those things  marisha okay  matt keep that in mind all right so you guys head to the cloudtop district towards the palace  in 
none	 the center you were about to say something orion  orion nope  matt do you want to talk to allura while youre here or not  orion no  matt okay  liam you should talk to her talk to her  orion she has no interest in me  laura she looks really pretty today tiberius  travis she wont have any interest if you dont talk to her  ashley it looks like she put some lip stuff on  orion im sure lady kima can satisfy any needs she has  laura i think theyre just 
town	 friends darling  liam you dont want to look back and regret what you didnt say  travis sings say what you need to say  ashley sings say what you need to say  taliesin listen to the tiny disembodied head  marisha laughs yeah  orion we can stop by there okay i only have a question  matt its nearly across the street from the palace so you head to the ivory tower you go  ahead and you take the giant circular knocker on the door hit it a couple times eventually allura  comes this 
none	 time in what looks like more comfortable robes she was caught offguard she  has like a terry cloth or some sort of big fuzzy material her hairs a bit in disarray she opens  the door oh hello greetings im sorry i wasnt expecting company  marisha what time is it  matt at this point in time its probably about id say 11 in the morning  laura oh shes a late sleeper i like it  marisha on like a sunday  matt sure  marisha roughly  matt roughly yeah  marisha okay  orion we 
none	 were about to depart on another adventure and whatnot and i was working on an  enchantment on this particular ill show her what it is  matt oh yes yes of course  orion its an enchantment thats easily you know finished enough i was wondering if in our  absence in your spare time you could probably put some time into finishing the enchantment whilst  were away  matt that should not be a problem i was intending to complete the circle of teleportation  markings that i had promised you for your keep in your absence 
none	 so  orion oh just waiting there as well  matt i could do both while im there  orion thank you so much allura  matt it would be my pleasure tiberius  orion it is sputtering well okay ill bid you farewell and ill do prestidigitation  pfft a local flower ill give to her for your trouble  matt a purple dandy as its called its like a starlike purple flower projects itself from your  hand you hand it to her and you see she puts her hand in her face a second thank you very 
none	 much  tiberius i appreciate it  orion youre welcome  matt she touches your shoulder gives you a smile and then best of luck return safely  there is youve been here too short to leave so soon so dont stay long please  closes the door  laura i shake his shoulders look at you  orion who knew  liam do you want to go steady if so check this  laughter  orion do you like me yes no maybe  matt all right you guys make your way to the palace back to the council 
none	 chambers where you met  naught but two days before the entire council has not been summoned to this its just about half of  the folks there you see the actual sovereign uriel is not present the individuals that are  there however tofor brotorus the female dragonborn paladin is present seeker asum emring  is present they are both in the room and you notice this immediately as you walk into the green  meeting chamber there are two envoys that you havent previously met two humans one male and  one female dressed in silver and blue 
none	 robes waiting patiently with their hands behind their  backs and beside them on the ground you see what looks like a large cube about maybe two feet by  two feet its smooth like a chromelike silver the entire construct of the cube with two  chainlink handles on each side of the box there is a very finely carved sapphireinlaid patterned  design all over this box it looks very ornamental and like it was a painstaking process to craft  you gather immediately that this probably is the container which was sent for from vasselheim  as 
none	 you get closer you notice the carvings almost have a snowflakelike pattern its very geometric  and perpetual almost a fractal that continues throughout the entirety of the outside of the box  its very intricate and beautiful as you step into the room immediately tofor stands up and  says ah they have arrived good im glad you all could make it the envoys have arrived with  the container for the horn i believe they are eager and ready to take you as their guards to see  that this evil is rid of this land forever envoys 
none	 and she extends her hand  they both step forward the man young but very soft in voice and very stern and military almost  hello i am scalebearer vorak i come under the platinum dragon and will be escorted along with  you and our delivery  as he turns to the female who steps forward shes older probably in her forties long fine hair  brown that rests just past her shoulders her features are very very fine you can see almost  like there is elven blood in her but not completely similar to your halfelf compatriots 
none	  she steps forward her piercing green eyes hit the group immediately and she goes hello i am  scalebearer desona also under the platinum dragon and will be escorting you on this mission they  both step back towards the box in a very ceremonial way everyone looks to the rest of you  sam hi nice to meet you  laura im sorry i was writing down your name desona what  sam was it vorak and desona  laura desona  orion hello  sam lovely to meet you im scanlan im sort of the de facto 
none	 leader of the group  orion that is not true i am tiberius stormwind hello nice to meet you  sam my second  travis everyone introduce yourself  taliesin oh percival fredrickstein klossowski von mussel de rolo iii at your service  orion laura and travis you can call him percy  taliesin they call me percy  matt they look about the rest of the group  laura hello  sam hi and youll be accompanying us on this arduous journey to the nor where are we going  matt vasselheim to the northwest in the region of 
none	 othanzia  laura oh yes  matt on the continent of isilra its quite a ways  laura are we taking a skyship  sam were taking an airship of some sort  matt yes a skyship is to be provided  they look at the council and the council nods to themselves and you can see seeker emring steps  forward yes yes a skyship will be provided waiting for you at the skyport here in the  cloudtop district were just awaiting one more as he says that the door opens again and you can  see lady 
none	 kima steps in no longer in the gold armor that she had found scavenged from the  interior shes now dressed in proper silver and blue inlaid plate mail  marisha who is this  laura lady kima  marisha kima  matt she is wearing the same colors as the two envoys you can see now the silver and blue theme  of bahamut is very much on display in this traveling crew sorry im late had to get  ready  laura you look wonderful lady kima  travis yeah you look wonderful lady kima  matt thank 
none	 you thank you  taliesin quite quite  matt well i do we have she looks about the rest of the group with a look of somewhat kind  of do we have the artifact  laura oh  sam were we supposed to bring that  travis i have it  matt the two scalebearers reach over and both at the same time place their hands on the top of this  chest you can see their fingers slip into these small holes on the sides and they lift and the  box scrapes with this highpitched metalagainstmetal scraping 
none	 sound opening up a  chamber on the inside you can see the interior also has the same similar scrolling carvings and  engraving on the inside of the box that you saw on the outside there is a slight hum almost like a  slight vibrational sound coming from the inside of the box kima looks to you guys expectantly  shall we place the artifact in its container  travis oh ill get it i reach in  laura no no no grog grog grog no  taliesin no no no no tiberius if you would be so 
none	 kind  laura mage hand  orion oh yeah ill hold the thing up  taliesin yes  laura were putting it in the box yeah  taliesin putting it in the box  orion oh  matt so it takes a moment the use of mage hand in a bag of holding is a very meticulous process  because the bag of holding responds to the thought command of what youre reaching for the moment you  reach in with your physical hand using it as an arcane tether its almost like reaching through  jello to get there 
dung	 so you have to really concentrate to get it through eventually the mage  hand takes hold of something you feel the tingling of something weighty in the grasp of your  arcane focus and as you lift out there aloft you can see the dark twisted horn of orcus as its  removed this is the first time the councils really seen it at this point and theres an  audible leaving of breath in the room everyone at its presence  laura yeah its pretty horrible  orion okay  travis what  orion hold on a second 
none	 were putting this in the container right  travis yeah the box the magic box  laura yes  orion i put it inside the bag of holding real quick  laura back in the bag of holding  orion yes im going to take off a tiny piece of one of my tickets of telescription and im going  to enchant it and i want to attempt to do an enchantment spell where i want to put it at the  bottom of where im going to  laura the box  orion  the box and if its 
none	 if any weight is lifted from it ill know like if theres the  old switcheroo somehow  liam god i so wish we still had the troll dick right now  orion oh man because i wouldve used the troll dick instead  matt it is already enchanted to reenchant it is a difficult process plus enchanting anything  would take time its essentially an alarm spell you could do it but it would take  probably half a day  travis i think we can trust them  orion okay  laura plus adding extra runes in there 
none	 might jack up the enchantment they already put in the box  orion its a tiny piece of paper  travis yeah i think were good  orion but fine if i cant do it then i just wanted to say  matt right its fine  orion i put it in there  ashley that was a good idea  matt i mean if you had an alarm spell at your disposal too that would be what the enchantments  based i dont know if you learned alarm did you  orion not yet  matt yeah so  
none	 orion its okay  matt thatd be a little different  orion so i put it in the thing  matt okay as the horn gets lowered into it you can see the runes on the inside of the box begin  to glow and come to life with this soft goldenyellow hue and the horn seems to be sss  pulled into the box and held aloft in the center your mage hand no longer has any sway on it it is  locked in place just in the center of the box no seeming physical anything holding it 
none	 its locked  there theres almost this creaking sound of air in there fighting between cold and hot you can  hear like creaking theres a small physical battle between the temperatures as they  take the lid and lift it over and seal it shut  the two bearers lift the chains on  the side and lift the box between the two of them  kima looks about the rest of you so onward  sam kima youre coming with us as well  matt damn right i havent been back to my temple in quite some time 
none	 it will be good to see  vord  orion kima im wondering who do we speak to who flies the ship  matt i dont know i havent taken a skyship in quite a while  laura im excited  travis i know ive never been on one  marisha i know  orion if we could maybe we should ask if they could stop at kraghammer for a second we could  drop in and get our money really quick  taliesin on the way back i think once the horn is off the ship  laura probably 
none	 best not to bring it there yeah  orion you know yeah we can use the airship later on for stuff  laura yeah yeah  orion which is cool  laura laughs which is cool  orion we have an airship  marisha what is this airship made out of  orion air and ships  laura and wood and magic  travis it only floats a couple feet off the ground its not that big of a deal  sam i pull vex aside for one second  laura me  sam yes before we go on this 
none	 quick journey we trust all the people who are sending this along  this journey right we trust the council  laura i believe so i mean we did a few insight type things last time but i mean  we can do some more  sam no no no  ashley quietly but what about the they sent the new guards  sam huh  laura i think we should definitely talk up the new guards and see what kind of people they are  when were on our way to the ship how about that  sam all 
none	 right good to go  travis brother on the guy sister on the girl  laura or scanlan on one  travis oh  sam ill take the girl  laura ill take the guy  taliesin oh dear  matt all right you guys make your way out of the palace towards the northwestern side of the  cloudtop district and what youve seen is there is one thicker tower that is part of the wall that  surrounds the cloudtop district what is essentially the bastion of defense for the inner  part of the city there are 
none	 these small pillars that hold up the wall there is one thats very  thick and youve seen only a couple of skyships travel to and from you dont see them in use very  often usually for very specific modes of travel or reasonings are these employed but you can see  this large tower that has a spiral staircase in the interior that occasionally lets out to these  small windows across the entire length of it as it rises up hundreds of feet to the very top of the  tower that surrounds this district on the 
none	 top you can see there is a platform that extends outward  on both sides of the wall and you can just barely make out the top of what looks like some sort of  construct there  as you make your way following kima up the long spiral staircase eventually though it seems way  too long to be traveling up a very thick spiral staircase you come to what looks like a trapdoor  almost like a wooden trapdoor kima hrah lifts it over ting ting you can hear it slap on the  other side some of 
none	 the chains clinking against the stonework and daylight comes careening into  this spiral staircase you all step out to the top and immediately are hit with the wind this high  up theres definitely a breeze that blows through your hair being tossed a bit  laughter  ashley whoa  laura this is crazy  travis im bald  matt you see roughly five individuals standing all in gold and white armor of various types and  they are seemingly employees they are currently standing waiting for you there is one individual  that is more adorned in 
none	 what looks like a captains uniform if you will and above them  with a bunch of ropes hanging from the sides of it you can see what looks like a large  beautifully crafted wooden ship that has golden scrolling this beautiful elvenlike golden  scrolling across the entire underside of this wooden ship you dont see propellers you see  what looks like two almost winglike protrusions on the sides of it almost like two fans that open  up that are probably used to guide pitch at the very front of it you can see what looks 
none	 to be in  the center of the ship one large ten to 15 footwide blue crystal that is embedded in the  front of the ship and on the back two more that are currently attached to the back side these  stones slowly rotate in place where they are and you can see theres this slight hum of arcane  energy that seems to emanate from them you can immediately gather that these three blue stones  are what holds the ship aloft silent and beautiful  laura awesome  matt as you guys begin to walk up 
none	 towards this ship looming about 15 or 20 feet in the air the  individuals in front of you all of a sudden glance over and notice and the captain steps forward  reaches out his hand hi im glad you could finally make it weve been waiting for a good 30  minutes im captain damon i would like to welcome you aboard the skyship deera we are  traveling across the ocean its approximately a weeks worth of travel we have provisions  provided for you do you have any questions  laura captain damon  matt yes 
dung	  laura just making sure i got your name  marisha and like skipper veera who was  sam airship the airships called deera deera  matt deera  marisha oh the airship  ashley i go up to captain damon and i put out my hand and i say captain damon it is a very  pleasure is all mine  matt sturdy shake  ashley i was a deckhand on the broken howl and we heard of many adventures that you had and maybe  youve heard of the broken howl maybe you havent but  matt no 
none	 but im willing to hear  ashley its a pleasure to ride on an airship so thanks  matt oh its a pleasure to have you keep everything away from the sides  marisha i was about to say i run over to the side and look over the edge before he says that  matt you guys are still on the platform he hasnt led you up to the ship yet  marisha does the platform have like a ledge i can look over  matt yeah  marisha like the empire state building  matt yeah you can 
none	 do that  marisha i want to do that  matt okay as you do that you really shouldnt do she shouldnt do that  marisha guys this is really high  matt she really shouldnt do that i dont  laura keyleth its really windy  taliesin its all right she can fly  travis i run up behind her and i grab her shoulders to scare her  marisha i climb up on the ledge  matt okay as youre climbing up on the ledge grog comes over and goes boo and shoves you  and gives you 
none	 a scare  marisha grog  travis did you pee a little  marisha a little bit  matt at which point you can see the captains like panting  laura dont worry captain damon theyre  marisha guys guys you should try  ashley she can fly  marisha grog hold the edge of my shirt i want to feel like im flying for a second  travis okay  marisha woohoohoo  matt if we could all please make our way to the ship we will leave posthaste  marisha guys you should try this  matt he 
none	 slowly facepalms and glances sidelong to you and goes a week we have a week  laura a week yes  matt all right  liam you have flown before you do remember that right  marisha i know but im always an animal  orion thats true as theyre doing this i want to go to the opposite end so i can get like  because this is beautiful and i want to hold out my staff and i  laura are you going to take a selfie  orion and im going to cast image capture  ashley 
none	 selfie staff  sam image capture  orion yes  sam thats a thing  orion it is in draconia  marisha selfie staff  laura are we taking selfies  marisha yes we are  orion getting all of them and the airship while theyre doing it  matt you use your prestidigitation to temporarily capture an image of yourself at the edge of the  top of the tower  orion and the airship is in it too  matt in doing so the dm imposes disadvantage on your next two rolls  all ohh  matt no 
none	 its fine its fine  sam nobody likes a selfie  matt i just hate selfie sticks so much  ashley well what about selfie staffs  laura selfie staffs though  travis they are the worst  marisha selfie staff  matt ill let it pass its temporary  orion look everyone  laura oh thats a good one thats a really good one  marisha thats a good one  matt you hear this loud whistle this wheeeooo and the captain you see is blowing on  this loud metal whistle around his neck all aboard on to 
none	 the deera folks and everyone  starts climbing up the ropes that are underneath the ship  laura oh ropes  ashley if you guys need any help i can totally help just so you know  orion laughs i can totally do it  sam captain damon just morbid curiosity are you married do you have a steady girl  matt he looks at you with surprise confusion worry shakes his head out of misunderstanding  what  sam never mind well talk later  matt all right he looks entirely sideblasted by that he was not expecting that 
none	 question  nothing negative just really confused so as you all climb your way to the deck you get on top of  it and it is the whole deck has this strange slowfloating sensation and once youre on the  deck you can hear this crackling hum around the large blue stones holding it aloft  laura wait how did trinket get up if we had to climb ropes  matt we will say laughs there are ways and if you ask this question howd they get trinket up  they go ahead  orion winches  laura winches 
none	  matt i was going to say no the captain gets back on the ship goes off to the side and what  you didnt notice on the far end of the platform there is like a large cranelike structure  marisha cargo  matt they actually raise up trinket in a small slinglike contraption  laura youre okay darling  matt worried bear noises as trinkets it was bad enough trying to fly when you guys were in the  underdark  laura yeah  matt now just paddling in the air absentmindedly as the crane contraption brings trinket 
none	 back over  and lowers him onto the deck of the airship deera  laura all right all right  matt eventually releasing trinkets now on board and looks noticeably uncomfortable and is in the  center of the ship sitting down  liam does that when hes nervous dont mind him talk to him  matt all right everyone on board  sam yes  laura yes  matt all right to your quarters underneath we set out now to vasselheim he blows his whistle a  second time all the hands separate most of them go underneath the 
none	 deck  laura wheres the box wheres the box are we keeping an eye on the box  matt yes you can see now the two scalebearers are carrying the box underneath and on the deck  you can see there are doorways that lead into various levels underneath the deck of the ship  there is a large cargo lattice section in the middle of the ship where theyre putting larger  things down below there is the actual wheel of the ship is on the back end on the elevated back  end of the entire ship and 
none	 thats where the captains stands up to as the rest of the hands  bring all the ropes up from the side  laura i want to stay on top but i feel like i should go to keep an eye on the box and see and  make sure  matt its up to you guys but as the ropes are brought up everyone gives a thumbsup on the  sides he reaches the front of the ships wheel you see he takes something from his neck and  places it into the center of the wheel at which 
none	 point the three blue stones spark with additional  life the humming gets louder the ship lurches for a second and begins to lift upward with  this slow gradual sensation all of you at once your stomach gets that butterfly sensation for a  second at which point the captain leans forward the actual wheel moves forward slightly and the  whole ship whoosh lurches forward up and over emon and those of you who are on the deck you  can look below you over the side you can see the entirety of emon from above slowly drift 
none	 away as  the endless ocean of the ozmit sea comes towards you clouds ahead beginning your trek to the  distant land  sam i can see my keep from here  matt and you can you can  marisha can we see castle greyskull  matt you can see its a little blip from here and its slowly vanishing but you can  definitely see it  marisha hi greyskull keep  taliesin weve gotten to sleep there for two days  laura oh wow  marisha i know bye  matt all right and on that note

none	 subscriptions that is how we pay our hosts  thats how we keep the lights turned on that is how we do everything we have a lot of shows on  this channel lots of different types of content we have shows about movies we have shows about  comic books its very different for a twitch channel were trying to do things a lot  differently that being said we dont accept donations all donations go to charity 100 we do  not take any percentage of charity donations so subscriptions are the way that this channel keeps  
none	 running if you like this show and you like our other programming you should subscribe thats  what keeps us going were trying to get to 7000 subscribers because thats what will make us  break even and start being able to experiment with newer and much larger programming outside of what  you already see here so if we get to 4000 by the end of tonight man whats something crazy that  i could do whats that liam  liam streak  zac streak thanks liam yeah thats great not a good idea we want that twitch channel 
none	 to  continue on not get shut down immediately what if heres a crazy goal because i know its like  200 away thats almost impossible but if we get there i will make and just so you guys know i  made the critical role intro video so i could make a music video from the cast of vox moronica  set within their world with a song that alex ify and i could come up with and then we could film a  music video basically talking about our escapades that continued on after the show the other 
none	 night  that seems crazy enough that seems crazy enough thats a crazy goal it would be fun but pretty  crazy and ridiculous so i could do that and i could have all of our critical role guests  featured in the video as their characters in some way so 200 piece of cake right piece of cake  yeah we could get 200 subs sure not a problem right guys im going to ask that lucas roll a  couple commercials because those commercials help the channel as well and after that well roll a  couple of 
none	 those intro videos and come right back for you guys  dramatic music  travis right listen up if you have ale then you have a friend in grog strongjaw a goliath of  towering height and size this barbarian has an appetite for the two great loves in his life  combat women and ale chuckle  record scratch wait  easily the brains of the group grog is often consulted for his vast knowledge of shapes  colors and chuckle shiny things  also ale  in his early years armed with his twohanded great axe grog often 
none	 enjoyed proving his might  amongst the ranks of his familys wandering herd but after coming upon an unsuspecting elderly  gnome in the woods he objected to the killing of such an innocent life a creature of impulse grog  felt only pity for this well this terrified little thing and his disobedience  cost him dearly  beaten bloody and banished by the herd leader his uncle kevdak grog was abandoned and left to die  exiled from his herd it was then that the relative of the very gnome he fought to save  saved him it 
none	 was the kindness of a gnome cleric named pike that healed grog bringing him back  from deaths edge and they have remained close friends ever since  most nights grog can be found challenging entire taverns to wrestling matches ha or accompanying  scanlan to the nearest house where you pay for lady favors  also ale  marisha a first impression of keyleth would leave you with little information on the halfelven  druid you might even think that her social awkwardness due to her sheltered upbringing is  kind of sweet chuckle  of course it would 
none	 be unwise to underestimate her based on first impressions thunder under that  unintimidating petite frame is a vicious beast waiting to be unleashed whose natural powers have  made even the fiercest of champions pee their pants literally soft chuckle  born to the air tribe of the ashari people keyleth was raised with a deep love of nature and  the elemental magics it is her peoples inherent duty to protect the delicate areas in taldorei  where the four elemental planes begin to bleed with this realm  since she was a little girl she had quite 
none	 a knack for air manipulation and beast shaping abilities  well if you consider kittens and flying squirrels to be little beasts which i do clears throat  anyways it wasnt long before the headmaster of the tribe her father korren realized her true  prodigious abilities and she was inveterated to succeed him as the next headmaster  just like that her jovial childhood was stripped and replaced with endless spell memorization  teachings from ancient traditions and exceedingly high expectations every druid leader to be must  embark on a journey to seek out the sister tribes in 
none	 order to introduce and establish respect amongst  the fellow headmasters they call this the aramente or noble odyssey when her father felt  she was ready he set her on the path to truly discovering herself not knowing when or if she  will ever return  as she hiked down the mountain towards stillben she meditated on the task ahead part of the  aramente is proving yourself a strong warrior a valiant protector and a wise and compassionate  leader with this knowledge one thought plays on repeat in her mind is she even worthy  taliesin 
dung	 percy was the third of seven children born to a noble family who lived far to the north  in the ancient castle of whitestone with so many siblings to share the burdens of lordship percy  turned his attentions to the sciences engineering and naturalism  one day a mysterious couple named lord and lady briarwood came to court during a feast held in  their honor the briarwoods violently took control of the castle killing or imprisoning everyone who  would stand in their way  percy awoke chained in the dungeon only to be freed by his 
none	 younger sister together they fled  chased by the briarwoods men as they ran percys sister took several arrows to the chest  and fell percy kept running eventually jumping into a freezing river and floating unconscious to  freedom he did not remember waking up on a fishing boat he barely remembered the next two  years as he slowly made his way as far south as possible  then one night percy had a dream a roaring cloud of smoke offered him vengeance against those who  destroyed his family when he awoke percy began to design his 
town	 first gun gunshot  ashley pike grew up on the outskirts of town near the bramblewood her ancestors were a family of deep  gnomes with quite an unfavorable reputation thievery destruction and trickery left them with the curse  of the last name trickfoot sarenrae the goddess of healing and redemption had other plans for pikes  greatgreatgrandfather wilhand who left his family at a young age after a dream a dream that changed  the course of the trickfoot family wilhand devoted his life to sarenrae and pledged from then on that  him and his family would 
none	 live a life of service and devotion as a child pike seemed to have an affinity to heal  whether it was animals people or even flowers she felt she had a purpose in making things whole that  had once been broken she studied and learned the ways to heal through divine magic she lived a  peaceful life quiet and simple until one day wilhand was captured and almost killed by a group of goliath  barbarians one of the goliaths took a stand against the murder of the innocent gnome and he himself  was beaten bloodied 
none	 and left for dead abandoned by his herd wilhand went to pike for help she  prayed and healed this barbarian as best she could bringing him back to life when he awoke she discovered  his name was grog strongjaw after that they were the best of friends a rather unlikely pair  little did she know that in a few years time grog would soon return the favor and bring her back from  the clutches of death after being killed in battle pike felt angry she wanted to be stronger so that it  would never happen 
none	 again she spent four months at sea training with the men and women aboard a ship  called the broken howl gripping her holy symbol in one hand and her morningstar in the other  this time pike is ready  sam oh you havent heard of scanlan shorthalt well gird your loins ladies because he has his  eye on you  a talented musician master of disguise and dashingly handsome in his own mind scanlan sings  songs almost as much as he sings his own praises  born a poor gnome scanlan used his endless charm and 
town	 soaring tenor voice to croon for coin and  support his single mother one day he was discovered by a halforc promoter and joined dr  dranzels spectacular traveling troupe where he learned the ways of the world and honed his  skills as a bard extraordinaire  a loner much of his life scanlan has never quite come to terms with the violent death of his mother  at the hands of a goblin invasion while his years on the road provided many shall we say  educational experiences with the opposite sex deep down scanlan yearns for the

none	 respected family at the age of 15 i succeeded in passing the sorcerers rite  showing prodigylike control of my magic the judges and the draconian high council were amazed  at how powerful my spells were for how long i had been training at 20 years old i was the youngest  appointed member of the magic guild in draconian history for the next few years i almost went mad  from the malaise of being a guild member as its rather boring  however one day i happened upon a chamber unused for quite some time in the 
none	 room were stacks of  books and maps of the surrounding cities and areas around the known world for months i would  frequent the chamber and learned of artifacts from legend  after a long period of research i made a list of artifacts that caught my eye i brought these  findings to the high council and was told that all of the information in the chamber i had stumbled  upon was either believed to be fiction or unsolvable mysteries and hence were lost forever  i found those answers to be unacceptable  a year later 
town	 i devised a ruse and managed to convince the city council to lend support in me  leaving draconia on a mission of peace and diplomacy for the surrounding kingdoms going from  town to town and making friends and allies in and for the name of draconia being a red dragonborn  i had quite the task on my hands in that respect but it was exactly what i needed so i could  explore the world and find these artifacts as i felt the truth was out there  some may describe me as buffoonish but i say 
none	 poppycock to all that i am much sharper than most  give me credit for i just dont pay attention to things sometimes ive also been known to be  rather cunning loyal happygolucky and well dangerous i cant help but show my true scales  every now and then but overall i think im quite friendly for a dragonborn  liam never entirely welcome in the company of elves or men vaxildan learned at a young age to  skip past formality preferring instead to invite himself in your door  along with twin sister vexahlia vax was born 
town	 by a chance encounter between elven royalty and human  peasantry raised by their mother in their early years the twins were eventually sent off to their  father in the elven capital of syngorn but their cool reception among the elves there never warmed  and their time in the capital didnt last the siblings stole away one autumn night and set out  on the open road  after a few years of wandering they eventually decided to return to their mother and journeyed  back to the lands of their youth but instead of finding their childhood 
none	 home they returned to a  pile of rubble their mother was gone their home burned to ash pressing the townspeople for  answers they learned of the day the dragon came roar with their ties all severed vaxildan and  his sister set out to find their fortune together in taldorei  an outsider since birth vax quickly learned to solve lifes challenges in his own particular way  often by sidestepping them entirely and when his knack for circumventing adversity isnt enough  knife scraping the way of blades the elves schooled him in more than  makes 
none	 up the difference  laura like so many halfelves vexahlia has spent most of her life suffering the cool  reception of a people who dont fully accept her born of a human mother and an elven father who  only later in life took an interest in their existence vexahlia and her twin brother  vaxildan quickly realized the only people they could truly rely on in this world  were each other  it was at the age of ten when the two were taken from their mother and brought to live in syngorn  the isolated elven

none	 put whatever spells ive learned for the day i can put those  depending on the level like a 3rdlevel spell scroll will take me four to six hours so the  higher the spell the longer it takes so if i spend two days i can probably make four scrolls  four or five scrolls  laura i like it  marisha yeah thats some pretty good shit so ill definitely make a polymorph scroll for you  laura thank you  matt let me first doublecheck about the time process creating a scroll  marisha thats the way

none	  laura youre so helpful brother  marisha its like i have a little familiar a scrollmaking familiar  matt all right not bad not bad  laura i thought you were into gilmore darling laughs  liam im hard to pin down  matt for the time being because i dont want to spend too much time with the internet watching me  scan through the books to find the rules for scroll crafting  liam thats the best part  matt well yeah ill say for the time being itll take you about half a day to make 
none	 the  polymorph scroll and the material components that are required for the spell putting into the actual  scroll would run you about 300 gold ill say oh 400 gold because its a 4thlevel spell isnt it  what level spell is polymorph  marisha four  matt okay 400 gold  marisha okay how much gold do we have left anyway  laura well i mean i can use my personal but we have very little party funds  marisha okay so i still have a little personal money left too  matt im sure itll be different

none	 400  marisha youll give me 400 all right  matt all right  laura im spending most of the time up near captain damon watching him work  matt he seems very focused on keeping the ship going he does steer you around one thunderstorm  thats rolling by and takes you on the wide angle around its very relaxing up here a little cold  but its relaxing lets say the beginning of day three as you all are resting underneath the hold  youre all shaken awake by a sudden lurching of the ship it just shifts 
none	 in such a heavy way that  you arent expecting it all of you are pulled out of your stupor for a second and begin coming out  of your individual rooms to check on each other and see what happened but apparently the ship is  or was some sort of a shuddering physicality to it  travis i rush to the box  sam i rush to captain damon what the hell just happened also are you married  matt all right so you rush straight to the box and as you go to open the door that 
none	 leads to the boxes  you can see in the room is kima and both of the scalebearers are there reaching for weapons as  the door opens they see you and relax for a second and kima goes like what was that what  was that  travis i was going to ask you the same thing  marisha shit  matt i have no idea  orion i rush up to the bow  marisha i also rush to the deck  matt okay as you guys are rushing up along with scanlan everyone else rushes up you 
dung	 come to  the surface and youre just cresting into sunrise like the sky itself is mostly dark on one side  with the blue slowly leading into a bright orangeish yellow to the other side as the morning  light is starting to slowly crest over the horizon as you get to the surface you immediately  notice there are a handful of large winged creatures that are currently harrying the side of  the boat as you step to the surface you see shhw one just dives past you real fast you  notice as one of them 
none	 takes off in the distance it was just a blur of quickmoving  wings it looks dragonlike in its physicality but its smaller than any dragon youve encountered  its flapping giant wings and lets out a  screech as it takes off but it looks like theres  something on its back  travis what  matt you see two to three more of these now starting to divebomb  sam its daenerys  matt you can see the rest of the deckhands are up there now with weapons ready and are starting to  fight some of these 
none	 off  laura can we use any kind of perception to see if the things on them are controlling them  matt go ahead and make a perception check  laura i get plus two for any dragony things  matt good to know  sam tiberius your brothers are here  orion i dont think im associated with these  laura 19  matt 19 glancing at the backs of these  liam garbled 26  matt what did you say  travis what  liam 26  matt 26 all right between the two of you you notice 
none	 that even in this lowlight circumstance there  appear to be on three of these winged dragonlike creatures smallish humanoid entities that are on  small almost leather strapped saddles that are put on the sides of this creature theyre  clutching onto it and each one is carrying some sort of large spearlike weapon there is a  fourth one in the distance that does not appear to be dragonoid this one appears to be  feathercovered in its physical form  marisha feathercovered  orion theres a big large one right though  matt yes which at this 
none	 moment we are going to roll initiative  marisha can i do a nature check  matt you can  laura okay okay okay okay  orion i cast blur before any of that shit i didnt get to say what i wanted to do  taliesin ugh thats the worst initiative i am capable of having  sam im just going to keep rolling until i get a better number  marisha do i do a nature roll first or should i do an initiative roll first  sam wow  travis sweet  marisha can i do a 
none	 nature check first  matt first i want to place you guys so you guys are coming up from below so i would  probably put you  laura oh my god look at the ship  ashley whoa  marisha cool look at that  sam oh i like that  travis dude thats pretty  laura look at the crystals  sam oh wow i like how all of our viewers are just looking at our midsections  liam aw ive got to turn on twitch so i can see it  marisha turn on twitch turn on 
none	 twitch  matt oh liam  travis here ill pick you up dont do it ready  laura it looks like the crystals are really 3d in the picture  ashley gasps matt  liam well the twitch the twitch is up  laura thats amazing  liam gasps this is like that jabbas cruiser game that came out  travis totally  liam anybody anybody  laura no  travis yeah  sam yes yeah sure that  travis whisper return of the jedi  matt all righty so  laura oh my gosh whoa  matt as you 
none	 guys come up to the surface you can see these three entities swooping around and  divebombing the remainder of the guard and deckhands that are now currently have haphazard  armor on and theyre trying to strike at these things as they swing by lets go ahead and roll  initiative folks  travis did it  marisha oh thats not bad thats all right ill take that  matt so we have 25 to 20  laura 22  matt 22  liam 20  matt who else had their hand up  laura 20  matt okay 
none	 so 20 all right 20 to 15  orion 19  travis 19  liam 20  laura laughs he heard you  travis we already got your 20  sam we got your damn 20  marisha 17  matt hold on  travis 19 19  matt 17 you said keyleth  marisha yep  matt all right 15 to ten  travis 15 to ten  matt ten to five  taliesin nine  sam eight  travis look at percy  laura what did you get  sam we always get the lowest  ashley what 
none	 up four  matt yeah laughs  ashley hey its not bad for the cleric to go last  laura thats true  matt all right so top of the round vex youve got this  laura okay im going to do theyre all far away from each other arent they  matt theyre all pretty spread out now yeah theyre all recouping from what looked like a  coordinated attack and you can see there appears to be what you normally see are about four to  five deckhands theres only three up there right now with captain damon 
none	  laura jeez louise  matt theyre either sleeping or not currently in the battle  orion what color are the dragons  matt from what you can tell the dragonlike creatures which as you get a better look at  these moment you know these a large number of the draconian army utilizes these as mounts these  are wyverns and they are all in a ruddy brown brasslike coloration to their form best you can  tell in this light all right vex what are you doing  laura i am going to hunters mark one of the 
none	 ones with the rider on them  matt okay all of them have a rider it seems  laura oh all of them  orion yes  laura even the one with feathers  matt even the one with feathers  laura ill go for the feathered one then  matt all right hunters mark  laura hunters mark hunters ring  matt hunters ring all right  laura and im going to hail of thorns him at a level three  matt okay  laura yeah  matt whats the range of that  laura it just says a 
none	 ranged weapon  matt so whatever your weapons range is whats your weapons range for your longbow  laura that is a really good question im going to run forward  matt all right how far are you going to run  laura that looks about right  matt thats as far as you can go with your movement  laura yeah that means i can duck against one of those walls where the stairs is right  matt yeah  laura okay cool  matt it will help you out with that all right so the range of the 
none	 longbow comes to 150 yeah  youre fine  laura so a regular attack  matt yep so roll for attack on him  laura 17  matt 17 does hit  laura yes okay so regular attack and then also thorn attack right  matt yep so you go ahead and roll damage for the spell at level three  laura and three 23 plus my regular 14  matt nice so a total of 37 nice is that a radial explosion  laura yeah so that should get him and the rider on the hail of thorns part 
none	  matt good so the rider itself also takes the damage all right so as you release the arrow  ssch it arcs through the air and you see the wind itself is very strong at this point in the  morning but you still manage thanks to your training and the magical nature of the arrow that  you fire strikes true slamming into the side of this giant and you can see it now flying with  this beaked eaglelike head this is a griffon youve seen them occasionally usually wild and  you stay away from them 
none	 this one appears to be used and harnessed as a mount however the arrow  slams into it and detonates with a spray of magical thorns you can see it recoils back giving  this screech sound  laura oh hunters mark i said it three additional damage for hunters mark on that  matt all right great laughs so thats your bonus action and your first attack you get a  second normal attack too  laura oh shit awesome lets do it  travis it just explodes in thorns its not a fire arrow  matt no  
none	 laura that is a 24  matt 24 definitively hits  laura okay  matt against the griffon as well  laura yes  matt all right  laura ten  matt ten damage all right got it so as the griffons reeling back and trying to flap away a  second arrow strikes it in its side it screeches again in pain and begins to rise  up over the actual area ooh i get to use these again  travis yeah yeah yeah  matt i love it  laura i love it  matt all right so 
none	 that ends your turn i believe youve moved and done everything else  all righty  laura oh i didnt move trinket at all  matt you can move trinket if you want still  laura i want him to be near me  matt okay trinket moves up to you ready to guard angrily  laura yeah but blocking on the wall  matt up in here  laura yeah  matt all right that ends your turn next up these guards all shift over to these three  emplacements over here you have large defensive bolts that are 
none	 locked into the sides of the ship  and they go ahead and they reach over in the barrel and you can see they take one out and each  one of these giant bolts has a rope attached to the end of it and they start loading it into it  pulling back to prepare it for an attack it takes their entire turn to do that but now  theyre at the ready to strike out against whatever they can manage to aim on  travis is that also at the front of the ship is that what 
none	 that is  matt one on the front ship there and one on each side there that ends their turn vax youre up  liam all right im running up right behind my sisters shoulder and because of my assassinate  perk i have advantage on this because they havent gone yeah  matt correct  liam so im going to click my boots of haste as i come up behind her and daggerdaggerdagger over  her shoulder ill use my brandnew dagger of lifestealing for the first time that was a 19  which is a critical hit for 
none	 me  matt you are at disadvantage on these attacks because they are beyond your 20 foot  daggerthrowing range  liam okay well i had advantage for assassinate and disadvantage for the distance so that brings  me down to even my first roll was a 19 which is still a critical hit for me  matt is that how it works  laughter  matt let me doublecheck here you have advantage its true you do  liam they havent gone yet  matt no it hasnt you have advantage it cancels it out so yes that first 
none	 strike is a  critical hit on this wyvern right here  liam throwing over my sisters shoulder so  laura warn me first  liam so here we go rolling dice in jersey its wonderful  marisha laughs rolling dice in new jersey  liam that makes ten so thats a 20 for that  matt all right  liam and im going to start slinging the other two daggers  matt all right  liam first one probably misses its a 14  matt a 14 against the wyvern  liam well i dont know do these all 
none	 get advantage  matt technically thats another good question huh look at this  liam all three are before they go  matt its true thats why im thinking probably im pretty sure you can get advantage on yeah  on attack rolls against any creatures not in combat yet so yeah  liam all right so then actually that was a 20  matt all right that definitely hits  liam okay that is an eight and the third dagger goes washing right over vexs  shoulder for a 27  matt all right  liam this one is 
none	 the poison dagger of course so that is ten of damage and then  its a dc of 15 for poison  matt all right the dagger strikes true you are uncertain if its had an effect unfortunately at  this distance its hard to tell its physical reaction to the impact however the dagger seems  to be making definite damaged appearances to its physical exterior and you see it recoiling from  the attacks and begins to once again fly up as well to try and get out of range  liam im happy  matt all right 
none	 that ends your turn its now the griffons turn griffon and the griffon rider  laura oh no  matt the griffon rider and the griffon are going to swoop down half its movement its going to  attempt to grapple against that guard  marisha grappling  taliesin grapplegrapple  laura and marisha oh no  travis that the captain  matt who fails his check grabs  marisha oh no hes going to throw him over the edge  matt grabs this guard into its claws  liam not simon  matt and then flies up and over 
none	 this side  marisha hes going to toss his ass over the edge  matt and hes going to release it  travis oh you are shitting me  marisha does someone have a reaction  matt hes going to attempt if you have something crazy  marisha can someone do anything reaction  matt the guard misses or fails to hold on tight with his last reaction to try and grapple back  taliesin thats such dick  matt the guard you watch as the griffon swoops down grabs him both of its claws and talons  wrapping around 
none	 his shoulders lifting him up and chucking him over the side you hear him scream  ahhh as he vanishes  laura as a reaction can we fricking tie ourselves down to the boat  matt you have no ropes immediately around you you have to go to the side  laura i do i have the rope of  matt you have nothing to tie it to at the moment  laura shit trinket  matt you have the pegs all on the side here where the ropes attach to so you guys could do that  marisha i 
none	 have some grasping vines  ashley we could just attach it to all of ourselves and where we go one we go all if they  take one they take all of us  matt and with the last bit of the griffons flight movement that was then there  marisha it would make it  ashley it wouldnt be able to lift all of us  marisha well it would make it difficult he would have to break against strength checks  against grog and stuff yeah  matt so there is the griffons current position on its turn 
none	 that ends there tiberius and grog  both go  orion okay im going to move over here  matt okay so one two three four five six thats as far as you can get there  orion im still in range of that guy right  matt yeah  orion good im going to use telekinesis to lift the rider off and chuck him off  matt go ahead and make your check plus five with your modifier  orion so thats no but its still okay thats 16 plus my this thing thats 19  liam come on 
none	 tiberius  matt so the rider which as you look over you can see appears to be small and halflinglike in  physical form you reach over with your telekinesis spell and concentrate the entity  thats gripping onto it and holding the spear all of a sudden gets lifted up and  then flung off the side  orion and i turn to the wyvern and i go speaking draconic and i in dragonspeak or  draconic whatever i say  marisha you say bad dragon  orion fight with me or be free  laura or be free 
none	 and be free  orion or he can meaning  laura oh i get it  marisha or go peace out  laura okay  orion right  liam it all sounded like enya to me  matt make ill say for this one make an animal handling roll  ashley come on  laura natural 20  ashley advantage because youre a dragonborn  orion nope  liam come on tibberhoods  orion like eight yeah  matt okay good to know  marisha did you have disadvantage  orion no i had advantage  marisha oh  matt 
none	 yeah so this halfling or gnomish entity is now falling out of the air that ends tiberiuss  turn grog whats up  travis i turn to the group and say make sure someone guards the box in case its a distraction  and then i rage and i would like to run to the front of the ship where the captain was as far as  i can  matt the captains right here  travis oh the captains there  matt yes the back of the ship  laura that was the guard  matt the guard got 
none	 flung off the side the captains still out there holding on to the  travis i will run to the front crystal  matt okay  travis if i can get there its 40 feet is how far i can go  matt 40 feet is right there  travis son of a bitch okay  matt well you raged as a bonus action you could use your action to dash and go the rest of the  distance doubling your movement  travis i wanted to tie myself to something though  matt okay  laura you could run 
none	 to the side and tie yourself to  taliesin what is that thing at the very front of the ship  matt right there its another one of these ballistas theyve all been set this one has been  set to fire just the person who was currently helming it got chucked off the side  marisha ooh youre the shooty guy  travis is there a railing on the side of the ship at all  matt there is a railing its about waisthigh  laura and theres pegs to tie yourself to on the sides  matt yeah 
none	 each one of these dots  travis okay i have a hundred feet of chain can i take the chain out of the bag of holding wrap  it around my wrist and wrap it around the railing and then thatll be all i do  can i do that  matt yeah with your movement you can get to there unless you wanted to instead head  over here and  travis yeah ill do that  matt so instead of going further up that route you go ahead and wrap the chain around there  sure chain around 
none	 your wrist you tangle it in with your chain of returning you go ahead and  take the chain and wrap it around the side of the peg and pull it taut thats your turn all right  that ends grogs turn keyleth youre up  marisha im going to move my speed over hereish  matt all right  marisha and then would you say im 60 feet within range of that guy  matt oh yeah youre within 25 30 feet of him  marisha oh am i well let me back up a bit then just right 
none	 oh i can walk across that  matt yeah  marisha oh fun  matt its a wooden lattice basically its mostly covered its what they remove when theyre  putting large cargo in the ship  marisha right gotcha and theres still a rider on that guy  matt yes theres a rider on all of them  marisha okay i am going to cast polymorph on that wyvern and i turn him into a bunny rabbit  travis laughs youre going to kill a bunny  sam no he wont die he wont die  marisha oh i 
none	 am going to kill a bunny  laura six hit points  ashley the guy riding hims going to be like ahhh  taliesin that is the least innocent thing shes killed in this game so far  travis that is an acme cartoon waiting to happen  marisha that is true i just think its going to be funny thats pretty much what i thought  liam buck buck thanks easter bunny  matt all right so whats the dc on that  marisha i guess make a wisdom saving throw the wyvern has to make a wisdom saving

none	 hook as it falls  marisha he came prepared  liam hes falling so slowly  laura thats awesome  marisha thanks that was my turn  travis that was slick  matt all right that brings us so now the wyverns turn  laura where did the music go  travis why has the music died  all sing battle music  matt its coming guys dont worry  laura laughs there it was  matt this wyvern turns and dives down to catch its rider lift it back up onto its back but it  uses its entire 
none	 turn doing so wasted their turn on that element  orion wait what  marisha and sam the wyvern caught his rider  orion how is that possible  laura it happened in like secondsecondsecondsecond  matt you threw it off the side and for the wyverns turn immediately it dove down caught the  rider and it helped it back onto its back but that took its entire turn to do that  travis bad wyvern  orion okay  taliesin but welltrained  travis bad wyvern  matt this wyvern is plummeting as a bunny rabbit now through 
none	 the air its going to attempt  to make its saving throw  travis fail fail  marisha fail  matt does polymorph allow a saving throw every round if its against its will  travis fail  laura i dont think i remember you had to be damaged right  travis bunny go splat bunny go die  marisha actually yeah i think  ashley bunny go byebye  travis thumpers toast  marisha it lasts for the duration or until the target drops to zero hit points or dies  matt yeah so no  marisha he just

none	 your chest and out of it this giant piercing bolt just seems to appear  out of divine energy lifts itself aloft next to you just hovering in the air  ashley all right so i want to pierce it through that guy  matt this guy  ashley yeah  matt so as you see it there you bring your hand up and then make a flinging motion it spins  rotates and then rockets off in the direction of this wyvern go ahead and roll an attack with your  spell modifier  liam kill kill kill kill 
none	 kill  ashley 18  matt 18 definitely hits all right so for the bolts damage in the speed of this and given the  flight i would say roll 2d6 plus five damage  liam sings  ashley seven  matt total seven all right aw  laura all of those dice are bad you need allnew dice  ashley i know i mean because of how heavy it is but wait i want to do it at a higher level  matt okay what higher level do you want to do it  ashley i was thinking of 
none	 doing it at a level four  matt all right  ashley and i know that does 1d8 but then was it just 1d6 because  matt it was 2d6 well what does the damage say on there normally  ashley one more time  matt whats the damage it says on there  ashley spell using a slot of third level or higher the damage increases by 1d8 for every two  slot levels above 2nd  matt and what level is it normally  laura three  ashley its a three or no its a two  matt 
none	 its a two so youre casting it at fourth level  ashley yeah  matt which means you roll an additional 1d8  laura dont roll that roll one of these  laura yeah  matt whats that  ashley okay so it would be 15 total  matt 15 total nice  ashley but then would the since so then would i roll the d8 instead of the sixes  for that last one  matt i would say given the fact that its a ranged bolt it would be is it normally just 1d8  for the damage 
none	 it deals  ashley yeah  matt i made it 2d6 because its a larger weapon and youre using it as a bolt  ashley all right i understand  matt so it did more damage circumstantially than it normally would  ashley okay  matt youre fine all right so that ends pikes turn brings us up to the top vex youre like on  the side right now youre in theory prone on the side of the ship but youre not falling  laura oh so i cant attack if i get up and out  matt well 
none	 no you use half your movement to get back onto the ship  laura okay im going to like brace my foot on grogs shoulder and climb up  marisha nice  matt all right so she uses you as a footstool and flips over lands on top of the ship  totally fine  laura awesome can i shoot my grappling arrow at this bastard here at the end of the ship is that  far enough is that close enough  matt yeah yeah  laura all right i want to shoot it at the rider i want

none	 hit it  laura yes 26  matt 26 definitely hits  laura okay so how do i do it  matt all right so roll damage  laura okay  matt its actually for the grappling arrow its going to be 1d6 damage for it its not quite as  designed to pierce more than its more of a bludgeoning hit plus your  laura plus my regular  matt yeah  laura 13  matt so 13 damage to the rider all right  laura plus six for the hunters mark one  matt all right  laura 
none	 and then ive got him grappled  matt and so as the arrow hits it pierces the shoulder for a second it causes it to push off  the shoulder as it retracts behind it you pull back and it catches the shoulder youre yanking  laura yeah for my second action i want to pull him off  matt all right go ahead and make an athletics check  laura okay  marisha nice  taliesin yes  marisha tugofwar  taliesin batman  marisha batman  sam youve got inspiration  laura oh well okay 16 should i 
none	 use my inspiration yeah  travis do it  marisha do it  laura okay so thats 23  matt 23 so using the inspiration that scanlan had given you you grab the arrow and yank with  all your might the tiny halfling form on there clutches for dear life onto the harness that is on  top of this wyvern but its not enough as its fingers are pulled from its grip and its yanked  off the front toppling ass over teakettle landing prone on the ground next to the captain  that it attempted to fling 
none	 from the side of the ship  laura yes  matt grappling hook partially embedded in the back of its shoulder blade  travis outstanding  ashley yeah  laura im still holding the rope holding on  matt you are yes all right  laura thats my whole action right thats everything i can do  matt that would be your action yeah that whole process  laura okay  sam sings this is the music that plays when things get really exciting  matt laughs all right this guard comes over here returns to his base where he 
none	 had set up the  griffon is right there in front of him he gets the bolt thats been set up there aims it up and  is going to fire almost pointblank into the griffon as it turns around  sam and he misses  marisha come on  matt thats a natural 20  cheering  taliesin way to go nameless guard  laura yeah go npc  matt and 2d6 double sixes  marisha youre a badass nameless npc  matt so as the guard turns around and releases the bolt the griffon is flying up over 
none	 the edge  of the ship getting away from the buffeting winds of the druid as it turns around a bolt just  pierces its chest the sheer impact sending it flying backward as it screeches plummets off the  side of the ship to slowly find itself to its doom in the watery grave below in the ocean  laura next to a tiny rabbit swimming around  matt next to a tiny rabbit that griffon took a bolt to its chest that is nasty all right this  other guard is going to  laura and the hunters 
none	 mark is on the little halfling thing not the wyvern just so you know  matt yes  laura oh no our music went away again  marisha is that like the only track we have  matt one track is having problems with audio apparently ill fix it later  sam matt do everything now  matt i know by the way we have some great audio tracks that some fans have sent that im going to  be incorporating into our playlist soon  laura oh thats cool  matt so if any of you guys are musicians

none	 them if its easier  matt all right go ahead and make a roll  travis yeah one would do it  marisha true  orion that is 22  matt 22 okay go ahead and roll 3d6 points of damage you dont manage to tear the wing off but  you do manage to pull its flesh and you can see youve caused the joint where its attached now  tearing open revealing bone and fleshy tissue beneath  orion thatll be nine ten  marisha thats like the most average that was like exactly average  orion yeah 
none	 ten  matt its tearing open  orion and i see that and i turn to vax and i go i like what you were doing earlier and i spend  five sorcerer points i cast telekinesis again and i take out eight of the daggers that are in my  pouch and i hover them around me and then i start stabbing noises towards the wyvern where i see  all the bone shit is  marisha hes making sushi  orion and im hucking my back and forth bringing them back and forth  matt just so youre 
none	 aware telekinesis is a concentration spell you dont have to keep  recasting it  orion oh i dont its just going  matt yeah  orion oh well then fucking thats whats going on and i spend five to do it again  matt just letting you know okay  orion because can i do that all in one action do that and then with the daggers  matt i mean no no to do the daggers you would have to cast it again the sorcerer points give  you another action  orion thats okay so i did 
none	 it right  matt all right  orion yeah so  matt but it wouldnt use another expenditure yeah normally you can just concentrate each round do  an action with it so  orion got it  matt all right so you just fling all the daggers at it  orion yeah and im pulling them back and forth through that tear in the wing  which i just caused  matt okay ill say go ahead and make four spell attack rolls so roll a d20 adding your spell  attack modifier  orion four times  matt 
none	 yeah so whatever your spell attack modifier is  orion so my attack modifier is the spell attack bonus is that what i want  matt yeah  orion thats 23 24 25 26 and thats what is that  sam wait is it just the d20 plus the modifier  matt yeah  sam okay  orion yeah and then 18 plus  sam thats 20  orion thats 30 31 32 because i get plus three on all attacks because of the gear im wearing  also and then seven plus that is 18 21 and then that 
none	 is 15 17 18  laura i have no idea whats happening anymore  travis thats a lot of numbers lot of numbers  orion so my spell attack bonus is 11 plus three because of all the gear i have on  ashley im getting a donut  orion on top of those that goes to my spell attack bonus which is what this is right  matt right well your bonus is its your proficiency modifier plus your stat modifier  which is your charisma which is five and your proficiency which is four so it would be 
none	 nine  orion so how do i have oh im sorry  marisha maybe you were counting this in  orion im counting this in so minus one from all those totals  matt thats okay they all still hit so go ahead and roll 4d4 plus 20 as each dagger is now being  jammed into the creatures open wound through the power of your telekinetic force  orion thats three 13 eight eight  matt 20 total of 28  orion okay yeah 28  matt takes plus five to each so 28 points of damage as its 
none	 wing is being torn apart the  daggers do streak through many of which are missing its form as youre just flinging them all  at it and then as they go straight past it you turn the telekinesis back and you yank them back  through as they tear through you see most of the wing is torn open and the flesh is now just  exposed to the air the winds buffeting it around its looking extremely rough and is  beginning its on the ground currently but it looks like its not going to be able to 
none	 fly right  now it is completely incapable of flight with the way you damaged the wing  orion as i see this im going to just hover all the daggers over the prone dude and right over his  face to keep him there  matt all right grog  travis i pull myself back up on the ship  matt okay so thats half your movement you still have 20 feet of movement  travis i look up and i see that everyones got that wyvern taken care of and i turn my gaze back  to that 
none	 little halfling in front of vex id like to move to him please  matt all right he is ten feet up so youre going to have to make a couple two athletics  checks to leap up towards him in your rage  sam two athletics checks  travis yes okay 23  matt all right and the second one  travis yes sorry 19  matt all right like a lumbering barbarian you get up on the thing and then just hulkjump twice  landing next to it as  travis trembling raging in the face i reach 
none	 and i pick him up by the top of his shirt give him a  sniff and fucking chuck him off the side of the ship  matt all right make another athletics check to try and grapple him  travis do i get advantage on strength checks when im raging advantage on strength checks strength  saving throws  matt does it give you bonuses or advantage on strength checks  travis yes when i rage it says strength checks  matt yeah you would  travis okay  matt so yeah you would have an advantage on this 
none	  travis laughs thats even better thats a 24  matt 24 all right so as you stand there with your axe up you set the axe down reach out and  grab the halfling who you see has this scarred face and it looks really haggard for a halfling  its existence is not in the most comfortable places especially to be out in the middle of the  ocean like this you grab it and for a moment its anger seething turns to sudden fear as it looks  over the side  travis you fucked up  
none	 matt and just goes plummeting off the side  laura oh man  taliesin poor life choices yay  marisha why did i get in this line of work  travis can we interrogate the last one  laura yeah i think we dont attack the last dude just kill the wyvern  travis im good  matt all right keyleth  marisha so everyone seems the only thing thats left is the wyvern right  matt currently  laura and one little halfling that ive got a rope on  marisha oh one youve got a rope on and 
none	 is the ship still like ahhh  matt still listing yeah  marisha its still a little crooked  matt yeah its still on the side and its slowly rotating as theres nobody at the helm  marisha okay i in my air form im going to fly over ill go through and im going to use just  my air form to lift underneath of the boat and try and stabilize it  matt okay go ahead and make an athletics check using the air elementals strength  marisha okay use my air dice eight  matt using all 
none	 the force of your elemental air you push and push but this ship is extremely  heavy and this side of it all the weight because the two other sides are given essentially  an antigravity force from the arcane all the weight is being pushed into this one corner  outside of a natural 20 you would not be able to help this at all unfortunately  marisha outside of a natural 20 wow  liam but maybe  matt you never know that could have been really epic that couldve been really epic  marisha cool  sam 
none	 instead it was just okay  marisha well i learn that the boats heavy as shit  matt yeah you do  marisha thats what i learned this turn  taliesin in one of 20 dimensions youre awesome right now  marisha thanks  matt its okay you essentially oneshotted a wyvern  laura and travis yeah  matt you bunnyoneshotted a wyvern  marisha oh its okay i dont need you know comfort  travis validation  matt i know  marisha dont need validation save it for orion  matt no i just wanted to bring it up 
none	 again i just wanted to bring it up again because i think  its the most ridiculous death to a wyvern ever  ashley death by bunny  matt okay this wyvern looking at the circumstance takes off tries to fly and cant  travis oh it cant fly  matt no because its wing is messed up from tiberius so it steps around to the only thing it  can reach which is you scanlan  sam thats fine  matt coming at you with a bite and its stinger again because it cant use its claws that is 
none	 a  sam and i sing my little cutting words song to  matt okay against which attack  sam im sorry  matt against which attack  sam oh he has two attacks  matt he has a bite and a stinger  sam against the stinger  matt the bite is a 22 to hit  sam oh he hits  matt all right you take 14 points of piercing damage  sam okay  liam scanlan  matt its entire mouth just opens up and clamps down onto your shoulder and torso as its holding  you 
none	 in place you try and pull back as its tail whips towards you go ahead and make your roll  sam what do i roll  matt roll a d10 and thats whatever the attack is reduced by  orion thats an eight  matt d10  orion thats d10 yes thats ten  sam zero  matt thats ten  sam ten okay ten  matt all right so it rolled a 24 to hit  sam that goes down to 14  matt to 14  sam my armor class is 15  travis yeah amazing  orion

none	 i can give it  marisha i know i dont feel bad about taking the ring  matt well fair enough so as its clamping down on you its tail whips in the air what words are  you going to throw  sam sings and you miss me like the deserts miss the rain  matt the wyvern who is still clamped down on your body its one eye opens up and goes you hear  an audible hruh and as its tail swings towards you it just hits the ground next to you slamming  into the wood 
none	 entirely distracted by your sudden lack of fear and display of beautiful musical  voice misses you that ends its turn percy youre up  taliesin all right im taking out the pepperbox im going to turn towards it and just unload  matt all right go for it  orion shoot that load percy  liam finish it  laura yes  marisha unleash that load  taliesin ten  orion damn it i wasnt  matt ten total ten  taliesin total ten  matt nope  liam youre the closer percy  taliesin 22  laura yeah

none	 with each successive blast even the ones that dont immediately impact the first blast  hits and explodes across its shoulder joint as you see the rest of the flesh that  tiberius had already weakened gets severed entirely the wing flung off the side of the ship  and disappearing in the wind beneath as it rears back in pain the second one hits its side the  third one strikes it on the other wing and as it rears back in pain its mouth open to the sky in  this screeching deathrattle the final blast hits it 
none	 under the chin leaving a gaping hole  under its neck as it steps back and then tumbles off the edge of the ship vanishing below  travis attacked the wrong ship  marisha wait wait wait can i catch it as an air elemental and bring it back up  matt you are under the ship currently you see the wyvern whoosh below you dive for it go  ahead and make an athletics check  taliesin oh look everyone we still have one to interrogate isnt that nice  marisha 12  matt you try to grab it 
none	 but your air form doesnt have quite and it just swoops through  marisha oh im an air elemental shit shit shit  matt  and disappears towards the ocean below  marisha forgot  matt as the captain gets up the other halfling which you can see is dressed in ragged robes and  has cloth wrapped across its face  laura i pull the arrow so it wraps up in the rope  matt the guards are there with their weapons drawn you can currently there is  still the spear thats jammed in the side thats sparking 
none	 causing the whole ship to list  marisha can i try and get that out  matt yeah as you swing up you go ahead and manage to as your air elemental form pull the  strange thing off the edge of the ship at which point the blue stone comes back online  and the ship rights itself  laura i thought it was cracked or something  matt now you know  laura we need to check on that box now  sam oh yeah that other wyvern was gone for a while  taliesin ill go check
