/none/ matt hey everyone sorry about that little issue there but thank you for your patience i  appreciate that going back over what had transpired previously so the party was hired to  go into kraghammer seeking lady kima of vord who is a renowned folk hero a halfling paladin of  much renown following bahamut the platinum dragon of justice and good who went on a vision  quest apparently seeing some sort of evil brewing beneath kraghammer and went on her own to seek it  and destroy it hasnt been seen for many weeks months even  /none/ since and so the party has  then gone into kraghammer to attempt to locate her after some conversing some brawling some  interesting circumstances they found information that she disappeared into the mithril mines just  underneath the lower circle of kraghammer theyve since battled a few creatures apparently these  strange monstrosities are coming out of the mines recently and theyve had dwarven miners being  taken and disappearing they charged into the mines found one of the series of tunnels that had  broken into the mines from some other source encountered a few umber hulks were /dung/ ambushed by  some duergar which are subterranean dark ashen grey  travis dickholes  matt  messedup dwarves and an intellect devourer which proceeded to blast grog reduce  his intelligence to zero and leave him catatonic and braindead

subterranean cavern with a deep underground river flowing  through it pitch /none/ darkness you managed to survive a conflict with two umber hulks thanks to  polymorph and some good tactics however grog then charged headlong towards a light source  turned out to be a campfire across the way where he walked into an ambush by a few duergar which  began shooting him with crossbow bolts and an intellect devourer  made him braindead you guys  laura hes got nobody to blame but himself  matt kind of thats okay grog owns it as you can see by his glasses so  all laugh  marisha i love those /none/  matt so were beginning now as grog has collapsed face down on the ground drooling  liam the futures so bright  matt the last of the duergar have been blown off the cliff or destroyed you all

little physical damage to /none/ him he shrugs it off pretty  easily theres no notable sign or anything other than the fact that his eyes arent reacting to  anything it looks like he is catatonic  taliesin no bleeding from the ear no bleeding from the nose  matt nope  taliesin im going to go take a look at the remnants of the brain creature  matt all right what bits of the currently thawing chunks of it blasted apart by tiberius  glacial blast it appears to be tougher than normal but very similar to gray matter in appearance  and /none/ texture other than these strange kind of reddishbrown bestial legs that were once attached  to its midsection are now blown apart and cast to the ground  the whole texture seems very slimy and rubbery  laura ew  matt and its much larger than any natural brain should be its probably when it was all in one  piece it would have been roughly about the size of a small dog  laura do any of us know anything about magic that could heal him like any spells  matt do you  laura i mean  marisha /none/ i think i might  orion its clear that when that brain thing hit grog with his zapper thing that it rendered him  unconscious i would assume that it is a magical creature just based on the attack alone  laura thank you tiberius  marisha anything we should know  sam excellent assessment tiberius  laura thank you  orion quite right  taliesin he got zapped and now hes unconscious  sam a shorter way of saying the same thing  laura maybe we should try does anybody have any healing i know pike isnt here but /none/  marisha i  orion you have

orion how many entrances how many ways or edges where we are  because its like at the center anyway  matt yeah youre currently basically on the precipice of a large cavern that has multiple  layers as the river kind of cascades off into multiple waterfalls as far as you can see which  isnt far good because theres /none/ no other light source beyond you guys the cavern just continues  indefinitely for a good 60 feet and then just vanishes into darkness  laura well maybe we should sleep try to camp for the time  sam well well need to form a perimeter and someone will have to stand guard  matt

perimeter and take turns standing guard  im going to go to the next cavern over to where we killed those umber hulks  matt yes  sam take one of the umber hulk heads and put it on a stick  laura ooh  sam right out front of where were of where were camping as sort of a warning to others  matt all right  marisha i want to check out  laura how about this  orion how many cavern entrances are there from where were camping  matt from where you are  creepy music /dung/ sound effect  laura oh no  matt there are where you came in through  orion right  matt strange things afoot echo in the silence theres the entrance you came in across the way  there appears to be another cavern that you can kinda see the entrance to those are the only proper  openings into this giant chamber otherwise theres just the giant overarching cave that you  guys are just getting into just pushing through so  marisha im gonna take the first watch  laura oh you are okay  marisha i still have /none/ a lot of reading to do and i can go ahead im gonna go ahead and cast  make sure everybodys in everybodys in  laura wait wait i want to check the bodies of the other guys before the  sam what are you casting what are you about to cast  matt duergar  laura yeah  marisha antilife shell  matt go ahead and make an investigative check  marisha a shell that keeps in anything from coming in  sam oh great well before you do that hold on  laura a 20  matt okay /none/ glancing about you pull roughly 125 gold pieces between the three corpses of the  duergar well two corpses because one of them is gone it washed downstream  laura right  liam she had all the good things  laura she had a lot of good stuff on her  matt yeah you do however find on one of them a gnarled implement of some kind whether it be  scavenged or not its of a strange like almost bleached bone ivory  that comes to a point at one end  orion ooh  sam lets look at /none/ it laughs  matt it is pretty  laura ooh let me see let me see  orion an artifact we can bring back to  sam can i take a look at it and  liam give it to tiberius hell try anything  marisha laughs hell try anything  sam history or or arcane  orion i like trying

sam ooh  laura what is it  sam nothing  orion wonderful this is wonderful magic missiles of course  marisha laughs  sam it sends out magic missiles  laura what  orion this one has seven charges while holding it you you can use an action to expend one or  more of its charges to cast the magic missile spell from it for one charge you cast the  firstlevel version of the spell you can increase the spell slot by one for each level by each  additional charge /none/ you expend the wand regains 1d6  1 expended charges daily at dawn if you expend  the wands last charge roll a d20 on a one the wand crumples into ashes and then  liam this all seems very technical  laura yes thats awesome  sam basically it shoots out six missiles and then it  laura awesome  travis isnt that a famous like  marisha it goes pew pew  laura im glad we killed them before they used that on us  liam yes its pretty standard  taliesin its a pew pew stick  /none/ liam pretty standard  marisha its a pew pew stick  liam yes  marisha cool  orion would anybody like to tinker i mean i learned this when i was 12  all laugh  laura no youre unconscious  orion oh ill hold onto it  laura well yeah yeah  liam i think grog may have soiled himself a little  we should probably get keyleth on the books  laura take a nap so that maybe  taliesin yes  marisha make sure everyones in and close by and get done with everything  laura okay /none/ shes gonna  liam keyleth you need to study so well take first watch  marisha im gonna take you guys  laura oh thats true you should study while we watch  liam you cant study and watch  marisha im gonna cast antilife shell that way everyone at least gets one good hour of sleep  laura oh good i like it  liam all right lets take a nap  laura all right  matt you go ahead and you eventually find one of the corpses of the umber hulk it takes you a good 25  /none/ minutes to eventually carve through its relatively thick hide chitinous exterior you put the head  on a makeshift spike and it is now there on display  sam yes as a warning to others  matt you feel accomplished  sam yes  matt you head back keyleth  taliesin terrible taxidermy attempt  matt  as you are taking first watch you notice that the campsite that the duergar were using  where you guys are currently resting for the evening its been there for a while and it  looks like the duergar have repurposed it the /none/ fire the stones that were set up around the  actual fire pit have probably been there for quite some time and were set up very uniformly and very  well placed right above you on one of the stone walls you see what appears to be a strange very  well carved symbol hard to recognize it go ahead and make a religion check  laura oh man  marisha ugh wish pike were here  liam yes we wish pike was here  laura pikes missing everything sobs  taliesin very much  orion yes we miss you /none/  marisha eight  liam come back little gnome  matt its just a really interesting carving on the wall just  right above where you guys are  currently residing  taliesin ampersand  marisha so pretty  matt not quite catching your attention but it seems to have some significance and its fresh  its not like an ancient symbol thats been there it maybe could have  been there for more than a week or two  marisha i go ahead and i take a piece of paper from my spellbook  and i take a piece /none/ of charcoal and i just scroll  over top of it  matt okay  marisha to get an imprint of it  matt okay its very big its like four feet by three feet  marisha i take a few pieces of paper and i kind of glue them together  all laugh  matt all right  marisha  and then i get a really big one and then i roll it up  matt all right all right you guys begin to set up for the next watch after the first hour  marisha and i have /none/ my antilife shell up  matt yep antilife shell eventually fades first hour without any impact or issue  marisha who is taking the next watch  laura oh we are  liam yeah  matt okay the next few hours go by without incident  laura thats nice can i look around and see i mean no in our area im not gonna wander off  but just to see if i see any kind of anything interesting i mean if this is a really old area  that ive noticed its old can i see anything cool and /none/ old around us  matt well theres a lot of mineral deposits this place in particular its definitely because  of the heavy river flow for a long time a lot of the area near the river itself very smooth stone  a lot of kind of accumulated deposits of various elements  you also catch the strange carved symbol right  atop your guys camp  laura okay so i tap my brother and go look at this do you know anything about religion  liam sighs well let me see  laura let me see  all laugh /dung/  liam well i seem to know fuckall about it ten  laura oh me too i know shit about it  matt its a very fancy symbol  laura its a really pretty symbol  matt you guys finish your watch  liam i really wish pike was here  marisha just the party is taking turns being like so pretty  laura i know  sam where was that symbol  laura on a rock  marisha its above our  matt its on one of the large cave surfaces near where you guys are camping  laura /none/ i dont see any cool sparkly things in the mineral deposits none of that  matt nothing catches your attention  laura damn it  matt  at the moment no unfortunately  liam all about the bling  laura i am about the bling  marisha hows it going over there grog  matt you finish your watch without issue  marisha its good  matt next up watch this is the last third and final watch you guys are now going through  orion oh all right  sam ill come with tiberius as well  matt okay /none/  taliesin yeah well all go  sam okay  matt okay the three of you guys keep watch after theyre napping occasionally you have to  adjust grog cause youre not sure if hes still breathing  orion ill roll for the  travis what  sam not sure if hes still breathing  orion im gonna do an intelligence right  matt to make sure hes still  laura what  marisha religion religion  matt religion  orion 20  laura oh my god what if you could die while were sleeping  matt right now you /none/ just rolled  orion well 18 plus two  matt oh okay  orion whats that  matt you are familiar with this symbol specifically because of your background that is  the symbol of bahamut it is the symbol of the platinum dragon  laura ooh  matt and you ascertain it was probably  orion oh it looks like this  matt yes  orion oh interesting  matt and it was probably used as part of some sort of a protection ritual  laura what was the name of the bad guy that she said  matt /none/ kvarn  orion i tell everybody that well that im with  laura thank you  matt using the thing you wrote  laura kvarn  matt kvarn  laura im gonna guess thats how you spell it  orion it seems its a protective symbol of sorts but its of bahamut which is a good thing  laura kvah i thought it was kvarn  sam its a good thing  orion bahamut is the essentially nicer deity of the two between him  and tiamat which is a total asshole but  sam well that must be why /none/ lady kima came down here  orion right so she must have camped here put this symbol up for protection  matt as you are having this discussion you feel a slight rumble in the ground  travis fucked up now  marisha oh no  matt some of the rocks nearby the loose pebbles begin to vibrate and move around  orion oh dear  sam grogs probably farting again  orion no i dont think i think we should alert the others  sam all right  laura were waking up were waking up dont worry we are /none/ gonna heal you  orion how far are we from everybody were just like  matt you guys are all clustered in the small camp  orion oh  sam lets quietly wake them and i will go peer into the darkness and see if i can see them  orion rumbling is never a good thing scanlan  laura somethings rumbling i wasnt paying attention  matt do you still have your light source up light or you just the

close to my loins  and i hold it tightly and warmly  marisha okay  sam  and caress it a little  orion give it to her  matt it is momentarily distracting but eventually you phase it out  all right so as you guys  all laugh  orion did you want my hand or the statue  matt you take /none/ a bit of earth from a pouch that you keep of your  orion statue  matt  home tribe where you grew up you scattered some of it around grog who is now laid  on his back whose arms and legs all equally stretched out  travis naked  matt no youre still clothed  all laugh  marisha lets not go there no need to be naked

where you draw your divine energy you kind of  marisha im so nervous  matt  almost take from the vibration of the nearby caverns that you felt and come in tune  with the way the earth the planet itself shifts and moves you  liam you got this keyleth you got this  laura you can do this keyleth you can do this  marisha im literally shaking  matt you use that to give constitutional strength to

30 no 29  matt 29 that should be enough  taliesin oh my /none/ god  matt so laughs in this circumstance you complete the ritual  theres a brief glow of all the  marisha ah im still shaking  matt the dirt that youd scattered around grog and you can see his form kind of take in a deeper  breath his chest expands and as it does his eyes which currently stare off in space begin to  clarify and crystallize and his brow quivers for a second  and you see a little bit of life return to his face  travis ugh kittens ugh nachos ugh  sam laughs /none/  marisha grog  matt grog your sight focuses as the party is gathered around you looking down upon your  currently stretched out physical form in a cavern youre very confused  liam welcome back big guy  travis i thought i was in algebra class again for a second there  all laugh  marisha grog  sam youre alive  orion why are you all cheering  laura good job keyleth  orion why did you run out and destroy nothing look what you did you were giving me crap about  the lightning dont ever do /none/ that again  travis sorry who woke me up from my sleep  electronic beep  laura oh siri did apparently  orion it was a group effort really but keyleth did an amazing job  travis keyleth i run over and i give keyleth a big ol bear hug  squeezing maybe a bit too tight  marisha ow  laura i think he shit himself while he was unconscious  so thats gotta smell really wonderful  travis i smell better than i ever have before  marisha just glad youre all right grog really glad youre awake /none/  travis i reach into the bag of holding and i get the cask of ale and my goblet  and i pour a little goblet of ale and i give it  to keyleth  marisha to grog  all to grog  travis to me  all laugh  matt as a note too just so you guys are aware 20 is the stat cap for normal physical stats  however magical items can then bump that up higher just answering a chat room question  laura right  sam i dont even know what that means question /none/ or the answer  matt thats okay dont worry about it  sam hey how is he doing how is he feeling  travis im so glad you had advantage on that  sam grog how are you feeling  orion yes  sam how is he feeling  travis my intelligence is  what is it now  matt its back to normal  marisha at like the gym and you need some alcohol after that  travis its six so  sam right where it should be  travis i feel right as rain what are we killing /none/  all laugh  liam brains apparently  sam how many fingers is this  travis three  sam perfect  marisha good hes back you guys hes back  travis blue oh no hold on  marisha good  travis square  orion i saunter over to keyleth that was mighty impressive  marisha oh thank you  orion that was amazing  marisha i had pike in mind i channeled her energy  sam its true it was quite astounding i have a little chub on  laura groans  travis laughs  so do i for some /none/ reason  laura youre welcome  marisha yeah well thats a bit of a side effect  travis it must be the morning  marisha thats part of the greater restoration a few things get restored  matt laughs  travis god bless you  liam do you remember anything about a kiss in your dreams while you were asleep  travis well my cheeks are sort of sore for some reason as if theyve been slapped repeatedly by a  bunch of twats and then ive got this one little wet mark right here  where i got a /none/ kiss and it smells like  halfelvish spit  liam oh that was trinket trinket helped with the spell  gave you a kiss and helped wake you up  laura oh why didnt i have trinket  taliesin and several slaps  matt at which point you look over and trinket is there off to the side  notably excited that youre moving again  bear noises  laura aw  matt comes over and nuzzles up against you for a moment  travis oh trinket you big ol furball  trinket noogie  laura laughs  travis can /none/ we go kill something now  laura well shit i guess we should i think we are all healed up  matt you guys all healed overnight  laura did he heal while he was unconscious  matt you did not get an opportunity to use any of your stuff so youre currently still at the hit  points you were plus you naturally healed just from the evenings rest  travis oh i did  matt four hit points  sam lets do some grog healing you dont have your healing dice right  travis i do  sam /none/ im gonna sing a song of rest for you so thatll add 1d6 to your healing rolls  travis yes 11 plus all right 12 great  laura how many d12s do you get to roll you can roll four of them if you need to  travis counts  matt you can roll up to nine  laura you can roll up to nine dice  travis oh  matt whatever your level is thats how many dice you can use  travis nipple tassels thats way better  all laugh  matt but thats for the day once /none/ youve used those nine hit dice to heal yourself naturally you are  maxed out outside of magical healing or potions  travis ive used two  sam shall we tarry on everyone  liam yes i have a feeling these tunnels are going to suck majorly  but we have nowhere to go but down so  laura so we know which tunnel she pointed towards  matt she pointed towards the rest of the cavern which you have just stepped into  laura can i use tracking and see if i can not only see where the majority /none/ of tracks lead to but  see if i can spot the halfling kimas tracks  matt lady kima go ahead and make a survival check  laura survival  matt which you have advantage on simply for tracking depending on what youre tracking  laura i do  matt what are your favored enemies  laura my favored enemies are dragons and demons  matt so you would not have advantage on this  laura ah screw that  matt thats okay what did you roll  laura oh but i do wait my favored terrain is the underdark /none/  matt okay all right for that i will go ahead and give you advantage on that this is  technically considered the crust of the underdark  laura that doesnt count if it rolls onto a phone  liam i think thats in this book  matt yeah yeah i think its chapter four  laura 19 is what i rolled  matt 19 okay as you guys begin to move you can find like there is this waterfall which you can  hear in the distance there are a number of cascading crashing water sounds so you imagine /none/  there are multiple layers as this cavern descends down into the darkness  what are you using for a light source by the way  liam tiberius yeah  sam tiberius hit us  orion whats happening  sam light  travis oh ah  all laugh  matt the cavern comes alive with bright white light  travis oh right sunglasses  matt using that you take a while and you begin to just keep tabs on the surface area of this  cavern as you begin to move further down you find some portions where you can /none/ climb down to the lower  levels the first thing you notice is there are definitive signs of struggle or intense running  towards the direction that you came from meaning things were seemingly either fleeing or heading  that direction very quickly some of them appear to be more recent than others you also begin to  see a few partially decomposed corpses of various goblinoid creatures you find two goblins just  slain just cut open and off to the side you see some of the skin is pulled tight against the bone  as a lot of /dung/ it is just rotting from the cave itself not a very great smell there have been  small pockets of struggle the more you progress down this way you also find some drag marks that  are similar to what you saw back in the mines and as you move forward and the light begins to open  up you can see small pockets of that red stone thats used to light a bunch of kraghammer you  can start seeing elements of it embedded in the walls of the cavern ahead and just faintly giving  this reddish glow /town/ and the outline of some shapes you begin to step into the outskirts about 60 feet  ahead of what looks like a series of huts small stone structures cobbled together with small stone  and stacked on each other simple driftwood and broken pieces of scavenged material put into small  buildings its a very kinda ramshackle village underground  sam lets burn it down  liam i am stealthing i roll stealth  laura oh okay im gonna stealth too  liam natural 20  marisha woohoo  laura natural 20 oh that really didnt count  liam /none/ just roll on your phone a couple times and then off to the side  laura they all sucked so  liam and you said that the red crystals on the wall are glowing somewhat  matt yeah its a certain amount of crystal that this mountain range  seems to naturally produce that just inherently  liam enough to give the halfelves vision in low light  matt it seems such at the point where youre close to it currently you have to use his light  source to see much of anything this village doesnt have any but /none/ near the walls and the edges  of the cavern you can see the gentle outline of this whole size of it its immense  taliesin does it seem that there are signs of life  matt from this view you dont see any movement  liam i am starting to creep along the ground towards the nearest building and press up against  the wall and see if i can im just going to listen  laura i rolled a 16 is that enough to actually stealth  matt thats up to you  laura no  marisha im /town/ going to let the twins stealth ahead  matt you guys stealth ahead the two of you follow each other and you get to the outskirts  and you can now see in the center of this a number of the buildings and huts have been smashed  or destroyed you can see more and more of these goblin corpses strewn across the ground you can  see some of these tents seem to have rags or something stuffed into one thats not too far  ahead of you theres two goblins near you apparently slashed open similar wounds its /none/ just  from the first glance stepping forward  liam none of them alive that we can tell  matt nope  laura we cant see any movement anywhere  matt not from this perspective you guys moved ahead and you barely have any light source of your  own youre having to deal with just the outskirts of his light spell  laura and none of that red light is lighting any of this  matt not in the center of the village those are only towards the outside walls of the cavern  liam so were in the /dung/ dark  laura can i go up and see if i can get one of those little red rocks  matt you can walk off to the side so you take a few minutes to walk off to the very edge of the  cavern the rock is less of an actual stone that you can pull more than its a cluster of almost  like a vein of the stone in the actual wall it would take a while for you to actually hack it out  of the side it can be done but it will take you /none/ a while  laura nah i dont want to waste the time  matt okay  laura what do you think should i do it  liam no  laura okay cool  travis laughs no  liam but were in pitch black here and we cant really see whats going on i think we need  laura a lantern  liam and tiberius  laura whispers tiberius  liam wait hold on tiberius will you bring the party up  orion oh yes of course well be right there  laura does anybody know have we told anybody at /none/ home what that actually is  matt okay so as you guys are aware one of the magical items that was designed by tiberius early  in the campaign are essentially these gem enchanted earrings that activate as a message  spell between a few party members he made a few of them  liam it was five total why dont we nail down who that is its the twins  laura we both have one  liam you  orion you have one he has one she has one  liam hes pretty sneaky all right  sam and /none/ we can send and receive messages or just receive  matt youre essentially whispering into each others ears  orion theyre like walkietalkies  laura its like a walkietalkie  matt but it only works within a certain range  sam is it like a madonna microphone  matt a straight up with a big ol  orion i think its like 500 feet  matt 500 feet is the maximum length so you guys approach slowly the light source opens up and  you see now a multitude of goblin bodies strewn about the open area of this village /none/ you can see  there are actually piles of corpses stuffed into some of these huts in the sides that arent  goblin you can see what looks like a few small dwarven bodies piled up on the side as you kinda  glance over you look some of them are partially eaten like they have been stripped for meat  laura ew  travis what  matt make an investigation check  laura 24  liam 22  matt okay  liam check that building  matt as you look through the building there are piles of bone sinew /none/ and metal at this point the  dwarven bodies are mostly decomposed entirely what remnants  have not been stripped off it for food  liam anything useful in the pile  matt as far as what you guys can tell you discover two things one of the dwarves has a set  of very very finely crafted leather armor  laura ooh  matt to pull it off the corpse is going to destroy it and  going to be a not very interesting affair  laura oh  matt but it does look to have survived the horrible /none/ conditions under here you also note  specifically vex that not the dwarven corpses but a number of the goblin corpses you come  across some of them have a uniform wound a number of these goblin corpses  have this terrible puncture wound in the skull  laura oh no  matt in the forehead there just an opening wound about that big around  laura you didnt notice that thats how unperceptive you are  liam my sister everybody  matt and for each one of these wounds for as much flesh is on these goblins  there /none/ doesnt appear to be anything inside  laura it sucked their brains out whatever it was  matt its very possible  travis i know what that feels like  orion ooh brain suckers  travis are we with you  laura no youre not youre still hanging out  sam weve come back  travis did you put your finger in the hole  laura im going to put my finger in the hole  orion i sauntered up cause  sam you sauntered up  orion you guys are sticking to the darkness  matt your finger goes /none/ inside you reach around there are elements of brain matter within there  but even that has become very gelatinous  travis oatmeal  matt partially decomposed in its own right almost like a slime but sure enough the inside  of the cranium itself is mostly vacant  laura lovely trinket no hes not with us  matt trinket is back with the party  marisha so we can only assume that what was his name  sam should we rejoin our fellows  travis yeah  laura i guess it seems like its safe enough right around here /none/ right now  travis we come running up  orion we do  sam traipsing we traipse up  travis skipping  laura as silently as possible you come running up  travis sings  sam whats going on guys  laura brain suckers something that sucks brains  sam as long as they are sucking it out of goblins im good with that  liam my sister doesnt remember but one of our instructors in syngorn used to tell us of a  creature im not sure what theyre called but  laura i dont think i was in /none/ that class actually  liam mm a creature that steals its victims minds and digests them  reaches right in and takes them out  orion im assuming its got to be a much smaller mutated version of our brainonlegs friend  liam i think its much worse  marisha yeah much worse  laura much worse  liam much worse  orion yeah  liam i think the brain was a scout or some sort of pet  marisha well we also have this kvarn who is experimenting on all those creatures  so we cant even attest for /none/ any of this  laura exactly  orion thats true  travis i take a few steps back  taliesin it could just be parts of one  marisha yeah parts of one it could be a hodgepodge of everything  taliesin a dragon goblin drained brained  laura gasps what if kvarn is a dragon what if oh wait i dont know anything about that  what was that symbol anyway tiberius  orion that was a symbol of bahamut and it was a protection thing  that im sure she put up to protect herself  laura oh /none/ so it was a good symbol  orion it was yes  laura okay  matt you recall that lady kima was specifically a paladin of bahamut  laura oh so she probably did that  marisha so shes been here  matt that camp seems to have been hers while she was traipsing through the tunnels  laura i understand  taliesin ah  liam i just think we should proceed with caution our teachers spoke about this thing said that it  was a being of the mind i think our trouble with grog could just be the /none/ beginning we need to  proceed very carefully  laura oh no  travis i have two potions of foxs cunning could i drink one of those since theres a giant  brainbitch wondering around the camp  marisha thats for your wisdom  sam how long do they last  laura you could make yourself smarter  travis but it dont last very long  matt foxs cunning would give you benefit i believe to  marisha intelligence  matt i mean essentially  marisha it would be enhance ability essentially  matt it would be enhance ability for /none/ wisdom im pretty sure  marisha ill tell you i think its wisdom  travis not intelligence  marisha no no no its intelligence  matt its intelligence okay there you go  marisha because i think its like owls wisdom for wisdom  matt right no youre correct so essentially it would be an  enhance ability for intelligence yes  laura how long does it last  matt oh for the potions effect that would be anywhere from four to eight hours  youre not quite sure  laura maybe you should wait until we come across something /dung/  travis all right but if its too late  marisha yeah you have advantage on intelligence checks  travis intelligence checks all right  liam just dont go running off into the dark again  laura yeah let us lead the way or whoevers smart im really smart how smart are you  liam not smart enough apparently  marisha so it wouldnt necessarily  travis it wouldnt make my intelligence higher  marisha it wouldnt make your intelligence higher  and it wouldnt necessarily help with your  vulnerability  travis all right never mind  liam hes /none/ smart  laura whos our smartest person who has the highest intelligence here  liam what are these scores you keep talking about i dont know what anybodys talking about  orion its okay vax i dont know what a lot of people are talking about all of the time  taliesin irl  travis yeah whoevers the smartest should be in the front  laura thats true  taliesin im sitting at 16  travis 14  liam 16  laura 16  marisha well its about like having high its not necessarily being smart  its about having /none/ resistance to willpower  laura but if they take you down if they take down your intelligence  then whoever has higher intelligence  marisha right  sam no ones going to take down our intelligence were too strong and were too awesome  laura i dont want another catatonic all right  orion and we know what were going into  laura all right  marisha well we sort of know what were going into  travis does that mean we get to run into a fight  laura oh no this music sounds very fighty  marisha hang /none/ on  sam or festive  laura oh no  marisha okay so heres my question  liam yeah  marisha so weve already fought two things where we cant look at them  and they mess with our heads  travis right  laura yes  marisha so is there something we can do going forward  laura to like boost our willpower or something  marisha or like  taliesin you want magnetos helmet what you want is magnetos helmet  marisha i like magnetos helmet or even if we  taliesin i havent built magnetos helmet  /none/ marisha do we have a bunch of mirrors or where we can look through things with reflections  laura gasps i gave you some mirrors do you remember  liam i have mirrors  travis we do have a big dressing mirror  liam but thats more for  laura for looking around corners  liam i dont know if thats going to help  laura it could help  orion i could make a mirror  liam yes i have them of course i always i always have them they were a gift  travis we have one mirror /none/ in the bag of holding  laura thats good  orion with like an icetype of thing  laura we could put a mirror  marisha kind of like a medusas gaze thing you know where you like look in the reflection  liam but thats a gorgon thats talking about the gaze  marisha right  liam were talking about the mind i think  laura right  marisha yeah  sam i have a whip and a forgery kit  all laugh  marisha it would just be about making us less vulnerable to the mind  liam /town/ could you forge some professor hats for us all  all laugh  laura so what our option is to keep moving forward then  sam yes just be cautious thats all we can do  vax and taliesin thats all we can do  laura all right  travis we move forward  sam what do you want to do you want go back  laura as quietly as possible to keep moving forward  taliesin its difficult to prepare for what were not prepared for  laura and on the lookout for anything in this ramshackle town  /none/ marisha thats true  taliesin sorry  marisha i mean i can cast enhance ability to help our willpower or our will  matt so you leave behind the pile of dwarven corpses you leave behind the goblin corpses with  the wounds and start seeing more of a pattern  liam and if i may i suggest tiberius you work your light spell and vexahlia and i scout ahead  about 60 or 70 feet so that we can see in the dim light catch anything coming using your magic  laura yes  travis and i light up /none/ the hooded lantern we have in the bag of holding  matt okay so you put the hood on and light that up very good leaving the leather armor behind  laura oh well i thought you said it would get ruined if we took it  liam and it was dwarfsized  matt no it would be nasty pulling it off a corpse  laura oh well then fuck it lets pull it off  liam isnt it dwarfsized or is armor also shrink and expand  laura its magical possibly  matt its dwarfsized  liam magical  /none/ orion its fine i cast prestidigitation and clean it all up  laura i take it  matt okay so you shake off the element  laura all the goo  matt  the remaining elements of the dwarven corpse just falls off out of the armor you have  to kind of shake it and eventually all of it escapes  laura yes thank you  taliesin dwarven corpse  liam its like pulled pork  laura mm  matt make an arcana check it does have a magical aura  laura gasps what is it  orion nice /none/ 20  matt all right it appears to be a simple but powerful enchantment it is a pair of studded  leather armor with a 2 enchantment  laura 2 enchantment to what  sam 2 enchantment  matt to your ac  liam if i try to pull on the sleeve does it come up to my elbow or does it stretch out and fit  matt it comes up to your elbow and then given a moment it fits to your form  laura ooh yeah  liam thats nice  laura go take that studded leather armor /none/ brother  liam ill take this hold on thank you i go into the smelly corpse hut  and start to change my armor  laura what did you get let me see that  sam so wait does he get a bigger or higher ac what is that  matt yes it is considered it works as studded leather armor but that gives him a 2 bonus to  his armor class on top of that  sam wow thats huge  laura yeah so he just took it  sam ill take it  laura he already took /dung/ it  marisha hey dungeon master asking as the dungeon master  matt yes  marisha if i cast owls wisdom on people it gives people advantage on wisdom checks would  that count on saving throws against willpower  matt no  laura damn it  matt not checks specifically  marisha would it help anything  matt i mean  marisha would would any advantage to wisdom under enhance ability help some  matt let me doublecheck it  sam ill give you all dice before we go in  laura some of these i remember we rolled /none/ charisma saving throws though for the umbers  they were charisma  marisha right and for the brains it was versus willpower  sam while the dm looks this up everyone subscribe to the geek and sundry twitch channel  support the show support the channel  marisha yeah and dont forget about our charity 826la which  helps children be literate and write stories well  orion it makes them smarter in the head  sam and keep sending us food  all laugh  travis we like food  sam and more presents  liam if you want /none/ a thousand years  zac theres more food on the way so dont ask them for more  marisha what  orion oh no  travis no food  taliesin and sam no more food  matt yeah we have enough food guys thank you  liam if you want a thousand years of dd weve got to pay the overheads so please subscribe  orion its true  matt so yeah unfortunately it helps ability checks those are not considered saving throws  laura all right  marisha i dont know if i have anything  taliesin well be /none/ all right well be all right  orion as we start to walk i cast stoneskin on myself  matt you cast stoneskin on yourself all right stoneskins on you tiberius  liam once youve got the dwarf gunk off its rather nice  laura oh yeah  liam yes its supple  sam all right shall we keep on keeping on  taliesin lets go  laura lets go lets keep on moving  marisha lets get it done  orion sings keep on keeping on  matt you guys keep pushing forward  orion is that what were /town/ going to do  laura all right  matt all right as you begin to press through the goblin ghost town  travis weve got to get it closer than that  laura im still tracking looking for anything interesting  matt which you do you catch off in the distance another faint moving light source  laura oh shit hey everybody calm down  sam huh  laura sh theres something moving in the distance  matt everyone roll a stealth check  travis stealth check  matt yes  laura oh god roll a stealth check gasps natural /none/ 20  matt and liam nice  liam 30  marisha 15  orion 11  sam 20  taliesin 12  travis softly six  matt okay as you all buckle down and be as quiet as you can  laura you rolled a six he rolled a six  matt you begin to see  sam whispers grog rolled a six  liam whispers stay put you asshole  matt no noted thats okay thats okay its a group check  in which case people offset each others  difficulty  travis yay bell curve  matt so /none/ you seem to be comfortable in the stillness of the moment best you can see in the  distance you see figures shifting moving away from you  laura whispers sh figures  matt many figures a fairly large group of seeming to be humanoid figures moving steadily  away from you  laura can we scout ahead were both really super stealth can we like  liam yeah were gonna start kinda quickly dash after them  matt yeah using your same stealth rolls you push forward  travis humanoid figures you say  liam could mean anything  /dung/ matt yes best you could tell as you guys start reaching the outskirts of the opposite side of  this small goblin village that has been completely sundered you see a cliff but a large  cliff the actual surface here comes to a very direct end and seems to just disappear into a dark  abyss there is a singular tenfootwide rope bridge that is bolted into the side of this cliff  and stretches out across this giant crevasse for what you cant see the other side  travis awesome  laura this feels like the descent i /none/ dont like this you guys  matt it very much has that kind of a feel it just goes on a for a good 60 70 feet and then  darkness and you can see what looks to be a cluster of about 12 to 13 duergar  laura whispers oh no  matt  making their way in lines of two across this bridge amongst them they have chained up  three dwarf miners that they are also dragging across the bridge  sam we have to save those ones  travis just cut the bridge  sam no /none/ no  laura what do the miners look like are they are they docile or are they  do they seem to be fighting back  matt they dont appear to put up much of a fight in their current circumstance  liam how wide is the bridge  matt ten feet  liam ten feet that means two people wide  laura grog goes by himself yes  liam but if we go out there its going to be close combat  travis whispers we have a flying carpet  liam you cant get to the ones at the /none/ back  laura i mean how many are there like ten or so  liam 12 12 i count  matt from what you can see it looks about 12ish  laura and they have a light source with them so we can definitely see them  matt they do its a very faint light its like a small cluster of the red stone thats been mined  and put into a spherical element and is hanging from a chain like a lantern  laura we have two options we can fight them  liam we could fight now  /none/ laura or follow them  travis follow  laura i think we follow them  marisha do i see any are there any bats  matt make a perception check  sam if we follow them on the bridge wont they feel it bouncing  marisha i failed  laura we gotta wait til they cross it scanlan  sam we cant see the end of it  liam i grab my ear and keyleth i heard you through tiberius earring  why dont you just become a bat and follow along  laura shes trying to do that  /none/ marisha i was gonna see if theyre in the  liam youve never seen a bat in the woods  matt best you can tell and from your knowledge of bats and their existence they generally live  in caverns that have readily available openings to the outside world where they do their nocturnal  hunting this is a very very deep cavern that does not have easy access to the surface bats are  probably not a good chance in this cavern  laura ive got an idea i run back to grog stealthed i get our flying carpet /none/  matt a hand suddenly mysteriously reaches into the bag  travis sputters  laura gimme the carpet  travis what  laura the carpet gimme the carpet  sam just you youre gonna go on the carpet alone  laura and him we can both go on the carpet  sam what if something happens  laura we just gotta see where theyre going well come back and get you  sam im coming with you  laura all right scanlan  travis i give them her carpet but i also tie the endless rope thread around  laura /none/ oh yeah okay so we have an endless rope with us  liam now were a kite  matt you pull out the carpet and lay it out at this point in time  theyre a little over halfway across the bridge  laura okay so we  matt which you can see it swaying in a very uncomfortable way  laura scanlan you better be stealthed  matt you hear the stretching of ropes  laura oh you can hear the rope  matt as you hear the rope just tense as the bridge is slowly swaying so you /none/ guys lay out the  carpet the two of you get on  laura and liam and scanlan  liam i grab scanlan by the scruff of his neck  matt the three of you guys hop on and its probably big enough for the three of you  its about the right size  sam shotgun  matt the carpet begins to lift off and you kind of will it towards are you going straight over  the bridge or are you taking a side route  laura were going next to the bridge  liam side and up /none/ cause they can look sideways  laura i think we should go down below the bridge  liam if youre on a bridge youre looking down at your feet  sam lets go above them  laura all right fine fuck it go above them  matt okay so you guys you take up over first off the three of you guys make a stealth check  laura i thought we were still stealthed  matt maneuvering on a flying carpet is a different type of locomotion  taliesin we have a flying carpet by the way thats a thing /none/  sam not great 13  liam 29  laura 17  matt okay  marisha were you guys trying to stealth is that what happened  matt so as soon as you reach the edge of the crevasse immediately the air itself is warmer and  theres actually a bit of a strange breeze blowing up from underneath this giant crevasse and you look  down and you can see faintly light sources long thin trickling  streams of what looks like molten rock  travis shit  sam way down below  matt way down below  travis /none/ thats a ways  matt its at least a thousand feet down  sam we dont want to fall  matt dont fall its very bad the air itself has a very sulfurous smell theres a lot of  various strange chemical scents thats a bit pungent to the nose theres a lot of chemical  reactions that are causing this atmosphere its a little difficult to take any air at first you  have to get adjusted it is a very very deep cavern below when you look behind you can see  the river thats been cascading through /town/ this cavern goes rocketing off the edge and disappears  into the darkness below are you keeping your distance or  laura keeping a good distance  liam distance because they have a light source so we want to follow that  laura yeah so we need to stay kind of out of it but see it  matt okay you guys push forward keeping at a safe distance you eventually follow them across  the crevasse and you can see now them entering what looks like a shanty town of tents and small  stone structures better built than /town/ the goblin village that was previously there but it looks  almost like a temporary or pseudotemporary series of homes for the duergar in this section theres  a bunch of military tents and cloth pup tents put up in sections you can see some easytoconstruct  one or twoday constructions of stone buildings very square very rigid and dwarven in their  design more for utility that any sort of visual presentation or beauty  liam this is a temporary war camp  laura it is  matt there are also a series of these  liam yes  /town/ matt  of these redstone  laura good dialogue  matt yeah its legit guys a series of these redstone torches that they were holding or these  lanterns are hung up all throughout the village on these giant poles that have been placed in  areas to give a little bit of an occasional light source throughout this entire camp  laura about how many people does it look like i mean how big is this camp  matt how big the camp  liam how many buildings  matt at a first glance you can only check out /none/ elements of it from your distance youre only  making out shapes from how far back you guys are without actually getting inside you gather youve  probably seen throughout just this portion that youve come into anywhere from 30 to 40 duergar  moving through as well as a few larger shapes  laura whispers oh shit  matt you swear you catch one or two other very large humanoid hulking figures just  thudding noises  laura oh no  matt stepping through the camp  liam how are we gonna get through this  laura how are /none/ we what are we gonna do what are we gonna do  sam the view up here is beautiful  laura sings a whole new world  marisha whispers hey hey what do you guys see  orion scanlan whats going on  laura whispers okay so  sam is the range how are  matt the range is getting a little broken you can hear  laura okay  matt the words are coming through but  marisha youre cutting out i cant hear you  laura okay  liam i think  laura well one of us  /none/ sam well update you soon  laura well one of us lets put down  liam put down  travis in the volcano  laura no no no how are we like  travis just go straight down  laura at a place where we can land the carpet and stand around  sam theyll probably see us  laura or should we go back  liam were past the chasm at this point or still afloat  matt youve just now crested  liam the other side  matt the crevasse the other side and youre feeling uncomfortable pushing /none/ further forward  because youre now starting to get a lot more eyes in your vicinity  laura okay are there any does it look like do we see any cavern openings in the vicinity  does it look like theres any  matt looking around there are no side caverns this is actually a pretty smooth cavern that kind  of circles around where this camp is built there is one large tunnel entrance  on the opposite side that continues past  laura but theyre blocking it or  matt you cant see anything beyond the fact that /none/ the tunnel the walls kind of convene you can  see a little bit of a tunnel opening and just darkness beyond that  liam so bridge to land and then a tunnel  matt a tunnel on the other side and where the land starts theres a giant portion of the cavern  that continues and then closes off kind of pinches to the entrance to where the camp is  laura how far away is the camp from that  matt the camp is completely filling this side of the cross its blocking pretty much the whole  /town/ laura oh so we cant get to that  matt not without going through or over the city  laura what about  liam so its bridge town tunnel  sam tunnel  matt correct  laura do we see any closer under the bridge are there any openings  underneath the bridge that look like  matt do you want to swoop down and check  liam yes  laura yeah  matt okay you swoop down and  liam whoosh  matt the rock there  laura whoosh  matt whoosh  the warm air is still kinda /none/ bothering you in general  liam makes farting noise  laura excuse me  matt you find yourself kinda taking your cloak and putting it over your mouth just to get the  scent out the side of the rock surface is worn through what looks like maybe a possible river  that also came from the other side that has since dried out so you can see there is while no water  on this side of the crevasse a lot of the stone has been smoothed just through rapid water running  for thousands of years possibly but /none/ there are no visible openings  or other additional caverns on this rock surface  laura what are we gonna do  travis whispers are they still on  sam okay listen leave me behind ill follow the party with the hostages ill see where they  go dont worry ill be invisible go back tell our fellows get them across the bridge  and well meet here in about an hour  marisha okay  laura scanlan  travis i like it  sam what im super brave and hung come on lets do this  all laugh  /none/ laura all right im down should we do it  liam all right  laura we drop him off  sam i turn invisible  travis sings scanlan the best bard  sam and im gonna just hang behind the party thats got the hostage dwarves  and just kinda see where they go  matt okay  laura should one of us protect him  travis do you activate hung at the same time  sam dont have to activate  liam hes invisible though  travis okay  laura i mean we cant go invisible we cant be /none/ as like  liam no  sam its passive  marisha its a racial bonus  laura hes sneaky we cant be as invisible as him all right  sam yeah but i might make i might snap twigs  liam last question where are the people the figures we were following  did they finish the bridge at this point  matt theyre long past the bridge theyre inside the city proper at this point  laura okay  liam okay so then ill stay by the edge of the bridge you go back scanlan go ahead ill wait /none/  for you here if theres trouble  sam dingalingaling  liam yes  sam got it  laura all right  matt all right  laura i go back thanks  liam shit  laura thanks for sending me back i go back  liam go get the others  matt all right  marisha okay  matt scanlan as you go ahead make your way in towards the city  go ahead and make a stealth check with advantage  travis cmon buddy  sam 16 18  matt 18 okay you push kind of falling behind the /town/ main group and theyre heading towards this  kind of more or less a loose thoroughfare in the center of this town you can see a few duergar  coming out and kind of inspecting as they enter speaking in a language you dont understand  asking questions some of them are coming out and slapping the dwarf captives as they go across or  spitting on them the dwarves look very broken and unhappy with the circumstance but brimming with  anger you see a couple of them are like true dwarves they havent given in to it theyre /none/ just  looking for an option or a moment to get some vengeance theyre stripped of all armor and  weaponry theyre brought through some of the alleys and paths between these pup tents and these  stone structures you can see there are some of the hulking figures  there are two trolls wandering amongst these  duergar  travis yes whispers trolls  matt now youve encountered trolls before but these trolls  laura gasps yeah we have  matt  also have a similar pupilless clouded over whiteeye appearance  sam ooh theyre slave trolls  matt /none/ as you begin to follow them further in you manage to see two ogres that are currently  stationed across this main open center location in this campsite and both of these ogres also have  the same pupilless white glazedover look to their eyes and theyre both just kind of glancing  about the rest of the duergar are in the process of constructing other tents some of them look  like theyre actually in the process of forging weaponry it feels like its a war camp its  definitely preparing for something however in the center of this /none/ main area you do see there is  a wooden platform about 20 foot by 20 foot that is raised up and you see a group of about six  duergar that are all wearing very intricate black iron plate armor  and theyre all just sitting on the outskirts  of this platform  sam white eyes  matt all the duergar seem to have that natural look to their eyes as well  travis shit  sam okay  matt as the party youve been following enters the center of this vicinity  make another stealth check with /none/ advantage  sam gah 19  matt all right you kind of step off to the side a duergar steps out of one of the tents near you  and you just barely manage to pull out of the way without making any sort of squeak or noise  he goes by sniffs  travis oh god  laura oh god  liam careful bilbo  matt and begins stepping out looking intently for something but right past you by inches as  he walks past you look over again to the camp and you can now see toward the /none/ very back end of  this open midsection by this platform there is one large stone construct it looks like a  makeshift barracks has been placed there with double stone doors that are currently opened and  you can see two figures stepping out of the stairs that lead into these barracks heading towards the  main platform they step up onto the platform one of which is a very very welldecorated duergar  whos wearing similar blackened plate armor as the other kind of elite guard that you saw surrounding  this platform but with gold and silver /dung/ scrolling on it a long tattered dark dark purple cape  and has a nasty scar across the cheek that leads into this kind of gnarled grey beard as it steps  forward you can see sheathed off to its back in a large scabbard a gargantuan for a dwarf  especially twohanded sword that should be unwieldy for a creature of its size but  nevertheless looks dangerous and a creature next to it is  laura whispers we cant fight these guys  matt  not so small not dwarven actually very tall lanky long black and purple /none/ robes a  hood obscuring its features stepping roughly two feet behind it as they both step on to the  platform to address the rest of the guard and the approaching party of duergar dwarves youve been  following you can see some conversation happening but youre too far away to really make  out anything thats being said do you want to move closer  sam do i speak their language  matt do you speak undercommon  sam nope  matt then you it all sounds gibberish to you  sam then no thank you laughs  /none/ matt okay but you see some conversation happening this seemingly officious duergar this  general that steps out and commands the attention in the room makes a few gestures shouts out to  amongst the other nearby not quite sure but you get the idea hes giving orders or directions the  war party then begins to pull the slaves back away and  sam the captives okay  matt the captives begins pulling them away toward another section on the side as it does  the tall lanky figure which you now get the sense that its not really /none/ walking  its just kind of drifting  sam apprehensive sound  matt  holds its hand out this long long finger and lanky hand and as it does every  single duergar in the vicinity whatever it was doing stops in place  and all turn and look at it as one  sam whoa  matt at which point this creature brings its fingers in a beckoning gesture  loosely in your direction  sam im wearing my ring of mindshielding by the way  matt for a split second you feel your heart at your throat and /none/ the entire back of your body  stands on pins and needles as one of the duergar carrying one of the captives begins to pull one of  the dwarven captives back towards the platform as it does the dwarf who is giving kind of a fight  and looks nervous looks over at the figure and its arms go limp to its side and it begins to  walk out of its own volition taking two three steps steps onto the platform and approaches this  tall lanky figure with the hood and long robes behind it as it /none/ does its hand reaches out and  caresses the side of this dwarfs face this dwarf seems to have given up all sense of fight or any  sort of conflict and just stares up into this darkened hood as the tall lanky creature reaches  out with both hands and pulls the dwarf forward you see these terrible purple tentacles come  writhing out of the front of the hood wrapping around the head of the dwarf pulling it into it  as the hood falls back you see this horrible smooth purplishblue hairless head these sunken  yellowishgreen /none/ eyes as the tentacles wrap around the dwarfs head and pulls it into its mouth  theres a brief struggle and then the dwarfs arms fall limp to its side at which point the  tentacles unravel from its head the creature pulls back a bit of ichor and dwarf blood  dripping from what looks like a lampreys toothy maw and then thrusts the body to the ground with  a thud as it falls lifeless to the ground  sam poor son of a bitch  matt a horrible bored hole in its forehead the creature then draws /none/ its hood back up releases its  hand in a cursory fashion and all the duergar whip back around and continue the motions they  were previously going towards as the two dwarven captives that now remain look completely stunned  their faces white with fear as they are being dragged off in this state the tall lanky figure  gives a nod to the duergar general who gives a nod as well then to turn around and walk back  laura oh god  sam worst show ever okay that was one of the captives  do i see /town/ where the other captives were taken  matt the two other captives you follow them they both are pulled to essentially to a western  side if you look overhead this is where the barrack building is this is where you entered and  this is the main area they are pulled off to the western side here they are taken to a large tent  as they are pulled in they close it behind them you can hear some muffles  and some growling from the inside of the tent  sam okay i assume bad things are happening /none/ in there i dont need to see it right i think ill  just kind of is there anything  matt do you speak dwarven  sam no oh no do i what do i speak where does it say shit  matt should be on the lower lefthand of your player sheet  laura did you choose languages  sam i play a shawm no i just speak common and gnome  matt you hear what sounds like guttural dwarvish being shouted angrily cursing from the interior  and a few other dwarven voices also joining in more than /town/ two you hear some horrible sick thuds  and some impacts and some cries of pain and eventually the five duergar dragging the captives  walk out carrying cudgels at their side still dripping with fresh blood  they kind of go amongst their own business  from there  sam okay i think ill go back to my fellows theres nothing i can see that door doesnt  lock does it lock by any chance  matt its just an opening tent  sam open tent theres nothing lying around none of that black armor lying around or anything /town/  any extra things   matt not on the street  sam okay i think i will just make back for my friends then  matt okay make a stealth check  laura oh god  sam with advantage  matt with advantage  all laugh  sam 21  matt you maneuver your way out back the way you came best you can remembering you get  disoriented in general trying to find your way out go ahead and make a survival check  laura oh no  sam survival check so plus zero 17  matt 17 /none/  laura thats a good roll yo  matt okay you take a moment orient yourself looking about the cavern this is a very confusing  network and the passages youve gone you paid more attention to whats happening  sam its like venice  matt kind of yeah you nearly get lost twice but eventually find your way back to the  southernportion entrance of this war camp you can just see the crevasse and you start getting  the familiar scent of that sulfurous wind that was billowing out from underneath you step out a few  more /none/ feet and you can see the edge of the bridge where the rest of you have finally come to converge  on the other side of the crevasse  laura ooh  sam whoa i am going to tell you everything that just happened in detail in real time  all laugh  laura maybe he can tell us while we are taking a bathroom break  matt you know what lets go ahead and take this moment to have a bathroom break  guys as sort of the halfway mark  marisha holy shit  matt we will continue /none/ this in just a moment in the meantime take a rest take ten or 11 minutes  we are going to play our character backgrounds for those who havent seen it  we will be back here in about ten minutes guys  marisha what are we going to do  travis we are gonna fight the shit out of them  liam were going to risk it all  break  no audio  matt  for her as well so look forward to that some point in the near future as we left off the  party had /none/ just reconvened on the other side of this gargantuan crevasse in the underdark after  scanlan had stealthed into the duergar war camp witnessed a number of dwarven captives being taken  somewhere however one of which was devoured by some strange creature left brainless and dead on  the platform in the center outside of a giant barrackstype building you reconvened and  expressed all of this information to the party  sam and thats when i came back to see you guys  all laugh  travis great  taliesin wonderfully detailed  laura what are we going /none/ to do  marisha i give scanlan some water from my water skin  liam you are a brave little fellow  sam thank you  laura has anyone come across these creatures before these weird tentacle brain guys  marisha ive heard rumors of those can we make a check for those  orion it sounds like it would be a mind flayer of sorts  laura a mind flayer  orion a mind flayer or mind slayer im not too sure  sam what is that  orion im pretty sure it flays your mind im never encountered /none/ one myself so i have no idea  really oh right let me check my books  matt intelligence  orion 14  matt you probably call it a mind flayer  orion it says right here mind flayer the rest is all inked up i got water on it  all laugh  travis how big was this mind flayer was he like 20 feet tall scanlan  sam he was tall i mean everyone looks 20 feet tall to me im a gnome  travis was he bigger than me  sam he was bigger than you by /none/ a little  matt no roughly a little shorter than him but taller than most  sam he carried himself big he was lanky  travis lets go fuck him up  laura no grog  travis what  laura do you want to be unconscious again we have to be careful here  travis it was rather restful  laura how many dwarves did it sound like there were locked in that prison cell  sam several  marisha did you see lady kima  sam no sign of lady kima at all just a bunch of dwarves being /none/ held against their will and then  one by one being brain sucked by mr lanky man  travis and those two big trolls  orion percy could you take a look at this  sam two big trolls and ogres dont forget ogres theres ogres too  travis there are ogres  sam yes there were two big ogres as well and duergar aplenty  maybe four dozen or so three dozen  liam spread throughout the city throughout this little camp scanlan  sam wandering yes  travis you know my tactic  taliesin would it be a /none/ nature check to actually think if i never learned about this in school  matt this would be an intelligence check  taliesin this would be an intelligence check  travis we should use the volcano as part of our strategy like moses  sam theres a volcano  travis well no the pit  sam oh the lava down below  travis yeah theres a shitload of that  marisha can i meditate to see if i know anything about this  liam this seems to match up with the tales that my instructor master tharendril told me about /none/  back in syngorn i wonder if i remember something if only i had a small polyhedral to roll wow  laura holy moly you guys  travis oh shitcakes  taliesin its a stack of pizzas  matt why are you guys so awesome  laura you guys are amazing  marisha yeah what the hell  sam do they know the address here thats kinda creepy  laura ah thank you i was wanting some ice tea  marisha thanks chat room  sam thanks chat room  liam thanks thank you long list  travis may your /dung/ list be ever long with your list  matt so best you can ascertain youve never heard the term mind flayer but in your people  youve heard stories and tales growing up about something referred to as an illithid  travis a what  sam an illithid  marisha an illithid  matt a nasty entity from beyond  marisha illithid with a d or a t  matt with a d  as far as you know all that youve heard is that they were considered ghost stories as a  kid to keep you from wandering dark /none/ caves and spaces they would take your minds and you  thought this whole time that that was just a fable that it was just a tale but you do know  that they normally arent solitary they usually keep company of a colony  laura gasps  travis fudge  liam shit  marisha but ive never heard them called a mind flayer but i guess they could be called a mind  flayer but we call them illithids i didnt know they were real though  laura what do we do  travis why dont we listen when /none/ my herd used to wander through the trees and we came upon a  force that was greater than our own we used the landscape to our advantage so why dont we  provoke an attack and then retreat over the bridge  sam and have them all jump over the edge of the cliff  travis you said they were all grayeyed right  laura at least theyll have to go one at a time or two at a time across the bridge  marisha but scanlan didnt you also say that they were like levitating  travis what /none/  matt the one lengthy creature  sam the one lengthy creature was levitating  laura well i mean can he fly or can he levitate  sam well yes but i think what grog is talking about is the bulk of the fighting force getting  them to follow us over the bridge and then cutting the bridge  travis yeah like in 300 which was a great puppet show i saw  orion oh grog i heard that where they used 300 puppets  travis yeah  orion its amazing  laura okay i like this plan  /town/ liam what if all but a couple of us snuck into one of these buildings and waited and a couple of  us made a stink and got a significant number of them to chase across the bridge  sam thats a good idea  liam but then how could we cut the bridge behind we have a flying carpet so we can go back and  forth but we could drop a significant number of them down into the lava  marisha can we have tiberius standing there to just firebolt it  travis whats the bridge made of /none/  sam do you want the rope  orion wait a minute we want to bait them is that what were trying to do  sam no we want to drop the bridge and have them fall to their deaths  laura or scanlan  sam yes  laura or what if you let off a stink bomb in the middle of the camp  sam well they would run willynilly  laura some of them would try to leave across the bridge  sam well remember theres a tunnel on the other side of camp they could run that /none/ way as well  liam its also a huge and your stinkcloud is only you know 20 or 30 feet across  sam 20 feet  travis only  orion how long is the bridge  matt the bridge now that youve traversed it its ten feet wide and runs about a little over  200 feet or 250 feet in length  sam you can get a lot of them on that bridge and then cut it  orion true  travis makes their numbers count for nothing  marisha i think ive heard that one that puppet show /none/  sam i like that idea  orion i think i might have a solution  laura yes tiberius speak your mind  orion i think its about time i used these  travis oh shit  orion for noncombat things i think we should create a diversion but let me do it i can use my  deck of illusions to generate any kind of number of sorts of creatures or whatever that i can  control i can simply toss one out i believe 50 feet ahead of me and control it and get their  attention i /none/ can draw them back through the bridge using the illusions taunting them along  the way they of course will give chase because they are chuckles idiots and as soon as we get  enough we can all you can hack away at the bridge all you like grog  we could both burn it we could hack and burn  travis what kind of creatures can you make  orion well thats all up to the deck  sam its up to the deck or its up to you  orion its up to the deck  laura lets /none/ try it  sam so what if its a scary thing that scares them away  orion if i generate something such as as exquisite as a red dragon say im sure somebody  like the mindfellows if they do flee the camp will be empty and we can search it and free the  slaves if not they will give chase and they will come and bait it  either way it works in our favor  travis can i test something real quick if i pull out the magic carpet or i take it back from  whoever /none/ the fuck had it and i stand on it does it hold me up or do i sink  matt you get on top of the carpet and you will it to begin to shift and the carpet around you  lifts but you are anchoring it to the ground  travis so this is a big problem  laura but youve got feather fall youve got feather fall is that still a thing  travis yeah which just slows my fall it doesnt take me across  sam that might not be a thing anymore  orion i do /none/ have feather fall  laura but levitate or something but we could tie a rope to you and it can  liam it makes him lighter yeah  laura  it makes you really light and we can just drag you behind us yeah itll work  sam why do we need to float grog  travis if we cut the bridge  laura in case we destroy the bridge  sam oh  orion oh dont worry about that grog ill just cast fly on you because i can fly  travis you can just fly me  orion /none/ yes we can both fly  travis okay  laura and you can fly trinket too  orion of course the bear  laura of course  travis im down for doing this  laura lets do it do it  marisha flying from the  orion we have ways across  marisha okay okay hang on hang on  taliesin this is a good plan  sam wait wait wait are we  marisha so lets have a failsafe in case a few get across the bridge  sam lets also recap which plan were going with one of /none/ us creating a diversion and running away  or these mystical magical  travis i like the mystical magical  sam  weird dragon creatures what if they scare them the other way  taliesin it would have to be pretty scary and then hey that works  orion i just said the path would be clear  sam what if  liam well are we scaring them or are we luring them  sam also might i remind  orion its all up to the deck  sam were luring them and also might i remind you all that /none/ theyre being  mind controlled by this what illithid  travis davy jones  laura i feel like we should try to  marisha illithid  sam and if the illithid recognizes that your  laura wait wait  sam  your things are false then hes not going to send his men  laura thats true  sam  off to chase them  taliesin or he may send them to kill whoever is creating the illusion  orion exactly  sam however if we were hm  orion either way theyre coming for us  laura maybe we /none/ could create a distraction and bring them away from the tunnels entrance and we  can just sneak around them no  orion i mean did you see a way to do that  sam what to sneak through the village to the tunnel no not all seven of us  and a bear are you crazy  all laugh  laura oh no hes trying to kill us all right  travis ill stay on this side of the bridge who wants to go be a distraction who wants to be the  bait whos real fast  sam /none/ wait are we doing his bait or are we doing a real bait  travis i dont  orion we can try both  travis what if you cast something big and they turn it against us that could suck  orion oh  sam its fake its just a hologram  laura its not  orion its an illusion that i control  travis how about we throw one of those and send  laura yeah  travis how about 5050 it one fake one real one of us one of the cards  liam ill go  travis /none/ somebody be gambit and throw that bitch  marisha we really just need someone to keep them from running through that tunnel  laura yeah  marisha we need some way to keep them from coming going  laura can you send a card that looks like a dragon on the other side in the tunnel  and then they run towards us  marisha oh oh oh wait wait  travis whats wrong with them running away from us  sam oh snap  marisha i actually have a spell while i was reading through my book last night /none/ catching up on  spells that i kinda forgot about i learned something called hallucinatory terrain where i  can make the entire terrain look like whatever i want  sam other terrain or an animal  marisha other terrain  travis theyre mind controlled  marisha what i can do is  laura you can make the chasm look like its solid ground  sam can you make the chasm look like its solid ground  travis ooh  marisha i can make the chasm look like its solid ground  sam can she do this  matt she /none/ can try  sam yes  travis i like it  marisha i can make the tunnel across the way look like its caved in  laura make the big chasm look like solid ground theyll fall off the edge  taliesin thats a great plan  liam thats a great idea but lets  orion ill throw the illusion on the fake lands  liam  lets stack the deck all right im still gonna be live bait because i have an  inkling that that thing whatever it is with the tentacles on its face  sam is /none/ gonna see through that  liam  is going to see through it so if weve got one real halfelf in the mix hell focus on me  so ill take the flying carpet and tie it around my back  laura you better run fast and not get taken  liam i have boots of haste  marisha are you good with hauling ass  liam mm  laura laughs  marisha okay as long as you can haul ass  travis all right  liam so i take the rug from grog  travis yep  liam im /none/ gonna roll it up and i tie it i have a rope to tie it to my back  laura its a big rug on your back  travis saddle up lets do it  matt its a very big rug  liam is it

might i interject im so sorry  marisha go ahead /none/  sam you guys you and you will be hauling ass away from the charging horde  laura you youre not  travis no no  laura no just him  travis im staying on our side of the bridge  sam on our side  travis our side  laura but hes got a rug hes got the flying carpet  taliesin so were gonna make them hallucinate  sam so when you get all the way to the other side of the bridge then were gonna chop  travis no  laura no were gonna chop it when /none/ they start coming across the bridge were hoping that  theyre gonna just fall off the edge instead  orion run off the bridge  travis they go yells  sam which side are we gonna chop it on our side or their side  travis once he gets back to our side  laura our side  sam okay  travis yells they come back everybody falls in  liam whats the bridge made of is it just rope and wood  sam rope  matt from what it looks like it is rope and stone platforms  laura /none/ oh  liam on both sides  matt like slats slats of stone that then the rope is tied around  laura okay  matt its a very very thick hefty twine  laura he can cut through that  travis all right so tiberius and vax are going over  laura all right  travis do it  marisha before vax leaves i just put my hands on his shoulders and i cast enhance ability on him  and give you a dexterity boost  liam okay  sam im also going to sing a little song  marisha /none/ so you have advantage on all dex rolls  sam  for both of them  liam so whats the boost how high is it  sam  to inspire them  marisha you have the advantage  liam advantage  marisha  on all dex rolls  liam on all dex rolls all right  marisha if that comes to that  liam thats great because thats how i attack  matt well advantage on dex ability checks  liam okay  marisha

rock formations that i can /none/ sort of use as a shelter and kind of stay  behind that but also peek around  matt about 20 feet off from the edge on the goblin side there is one outcropping of like a  large stalagmite that you could probably get behind  laura oh on the goblin side  matt on the goblin side oh do you wanna be on their side  laura i want to be on our side  matt your side meaning the side that the war camp is on  laura no i thought we were all on the other /none/ side of the bridge  sam were gonna stay on the side that doesnt have all the bad guys on it  matt right theres the goblin side which is where you guys first went through theres the  bridge and then theres the war camp side  laura and travis goblin side  matt all right so youre on goblin side for you goblin side for grog  travis yep  matt goblin side for percy setting up the bad news your crazy gun  taliesin oh yeah  laura youre on the war camp side  taliesin gonna /none/ be great  matt and scanlan as well  liam right and im gonna run that but you guys are all going back to  laura were on the goblin side  liam the safer side the further side  laura yeah  marisha im gonna be can i be like halfway in between on the bridge is that a bad idea  matt you can do that its up to you  travis go for it you can fly  laura can she fly  matt turn into birds  marisha i can turn into a bird  matt /none/ shes a druid  laura oh you can turn into a bird  travis yeah shes fine  laura how long does your spell cast i mean your spell last  travis snickers  laura shut up  marisha my which one  laura your illusion spell  marisha its a concentration thing so as long as i can keep it up  laura so maybe you should do that  marisha oh yeah for up to 30 24 hours actually its not a concentration spell  laura so how far does it reach  marisha 300 feet  laura /none/ okay  marisha 150 square feet  matt right okay  liam just needs to  marisha and it looks sounds  liam  work around the edge of the bridge  marisha  smells like some other sort of natural terrain  matt so what are you going to make the terrain look like what is your alteration  marisha so what im doing whenever we can i make it look like  theres a cavein happening through the tunnel  laura whispers wait no make it look like its really far  liam keyleth what if you fudged /none/ it so the cliff  marisha well thats what im gonna do  liam  looked like it went 30 feet further out  marisha yeah what im gonna do i just want the terrain to look on my side  liam close to what theyre used to  marisha i want the terrain to look exactly like what it is but i just wanna stretch it out a  little bit so it looks like theyve got like an extra running space  matt okay okay  liam yeah so if it looks too different  matt so like /none/ an additional 40 or so feet out from the actual  marisha yes of actual yes like the bridge is an extra 40 feet away  matt okay the actual ceiling is maybe about 120 feet up so it might be a little hard to do that  and cause a caveintype illusion  marisha okay then ill do that then im gonna just you know what im gonna stay on the  opposite side of the bridge and im gonna focus on making that illusion  matt okay cool so you go ahead and you cast hallucinatory terrain  /none/ marisha yep  laura yells  matt you now see an additional 40 feet of the cliff stretching out  laura it looks very realistic  marisha thank you  matt and you can actually see that the bridge looks attached to it its a very very convincing  illusion and you kind of have to remind yourself that its an illusion just so you dont fall for  it either  marisha yes be careful guys please be careful  matt all right so youre kind of chilling in the middle of the bridge  marisha mmhm  matt /none/ all right the rest of you are  marisha all right im on the outside of the bridge  matt  on the other side outside of the bridge  marisha im out with them  matt okay so youre off the bridge now  marisha gone yeah  matt all right so now tiberius vax you guys walk across the bridge keeping grip both side  rails feeling it rock to and fro from the continuous warm bellowing of wind up from the  cavern beneath you eventually you bring your way across what looks like you should be /none/ stepping on  terrain is still the bridge and it takes you a minute to adjust to the fact that youre still  going across the bridge but it looks like rocky terrain eventually you make it to the other side  and you grab purchase on stone looking ahead of you you can see about 60 feet ahead of you the  outskirts of the war camp  liam okay  tiberius you wait here ready to run i take tiberius by the arm like this vox machina  orion vox machina  all laugh  liam okay so /town/ i stealthily walk up to the closing distance to the edge of town and i stand  there i click my boots of haste together  laura oh god  orion as he runs off i cast greater invisibility on myself  matt all right  orion i cast fly on myself and i hover  matt both of those are concentration spells  orion fuck  matt you can only have one of those up at any given point in time  orion ill cast fly then  matt okay  orion yes  matt so youre now floating /none/ up okay  liam okay  orion and im at enough edge to where her illusions are as well  matt okay  orion but over the bridge just in case i fall  laura laughs  matt okay all right so youre now just kinda hovering above the bridge now you  liam i just clicked the boots  matt you feel the sudden surge of magical energy through your body like  adrenaline just pumping into your system  liam and i cry out full voice listen up you walking prawn doom has come for you today  /none/ step forth you slimy bastard  laura oh fuck  all laugh  orion as he does that i toss out three cards  matt all right  laura oh gosh  liam your trolls cant save you  orion right at the rim of where the illusion stops  laura i will find you  liam no matter how far or how long  matt been awhile since youve used those  laughs all right oh okay  you shuffled these right  travis we should call this a rim job  orion yes  matt all right this /none/ will be very very interesting  liam oh jesus  laura oh god  taliesin this is a good plan  sam you got your dice  travis sure it is  liam its a great plan  sam use your dice  marisha are you convincing yourself or are you  taliesin this is a good plan  travis were on the safe side with bad news and me  taliesin were fine  marisha yeah im with you guys were fine  matt so currently one of the cards bursts and you can see rising up from its /none/ energy this  awfullooking humanoid skeletal undead creature with long golden red robes with this gnarled gold  crown and these glowing blue eyes and just pure arcane energy  across this horribly gnarled skeletal face  travis okay  matt there stands this hideouslooking lich cackling to itself  orion ah the ace of spades two of spades it changed dammit looking at pathfinder right now  all laugh  orion two of spades  liam tiberius can we hit it and quit it  laura what are the other ones  matt the other one poof and you /none/ see before you a kind of   orion flip them over they have good graphics on the cover  matt its nice through the smoke you see what looks like some sort of a human kind of long  longfighting warrior grizzled ready to fight has a big old longsword out armored up in  scalemail one eye is kinda wounded and he just kinda sits there and growls with his blade ready  the third card from the smoke appears a redskinned dragonborn with long blue robes and a  staff with a glowing beam of light on /none/ it  travis yes  orion oh it must be a joker  matt you see an exact duplicate of tiberius now standing there as the three illusions stand  all laugh  travis outstanding  marisha thats perfect  matt your cards are now spent correct  orion uh no they exist until i dispel them  matt right but i mean the actual cards dont go back in the deck  orion yes they do  matt they do okay all right never mind okay as you shout out the card illusion appears you  see about five /town/ or six duergar kind of look out from a nearby tent and go and then start running  toward the center of the town  marisha come here bitches  matt about 20 seconds pass and then you start hearing this boom boom boom boom it sounds like  a drum beat  laura oh my god  sam cut the rope cut the rope  laura not yet not yet not yet  sam leave vax there lets go  all laugh  matt at this point you now see about 16 duergar come running out from the center /town/ of town armored  weapons drawn a few with crossbows two trolls and an ogre charging out you see the ogres  holding this giant it looks like a stone slab for one of its clubs and the two trolls just come  with their claws open rushing right towards you and the illusions  laura oh my gosh  liam i start flipping  orion i command the lich to start doing one of his glowy spells and like through him i go  whispers come for us your death awaits  all laugh  matt all right  /none/ liam and i flip the double birds and start walking backwards a little bit  sam oh yes thats even better  marisha just watch your step  liam yes straight back  orion i command the soldier to start swinging his sword  matt as youre stepping back four of the duergar immediately take using their inertia  pull and release javelins in your direction  liam okay  laura oh god  matt all right whats your ac  laura oh gosh  liam my ac is 19  matt all right you take two javelins  liam /none/ im gonna use uncanny dodge for anything i can see i can dodge  for half damage if i need to  matt all right good to know the first one strikes  you in the torso for a total of 11 damage  liam shit okay  orion oh  matt the other hits you for a total of eight damage  liam is that the halved or  orion total  matt no well you can choose to half one its up to you you choose which one  probably the higher one  liam okay so it /none/ was 11 and eight  matt so it would be six  liam okay six and eight okay 14  matt 14 points of damage with these just javelins hitting you like oh thats right  they have range  all laugh  liam right i knew this was coming  laura right  matt you can immediately see one of the trolls goes and just lunges forward and slashes the lich  just passing through its form  orion he lunges at the lich  matt yeah  orion sweet  matt it went through it kinda loses its /none/ footing for a second stops and kinda looks angry  turns and starts slashing at it again  laura run run away  sam  fake ground  orion and im like  marisha yeah isnt he on the fake ground the lich  orion yes yeah hes like right at the edge  matt yeah right at the precipice  orion i cant throw my card on the fake ground theyd fall  matt yeah so the troll kind of steps forward  orion theyre right at the edge though  matt  and the troll turns around and /none/ starts slashing the other one goes right for the  veteran and laughs goes running right off the edge  laura gasps  all yes  sam the troll  matt that was the troll just falling sounds the ogre goes running forward right towards you  orion i command the  liam yes  matt just their speed theyre just the first ones to get there duergar have tiny legs  liam highpitched voice wheres the roll for initiative man  laura youre already back youre at the bridge  matt this is what im saying what are you /none/ doing this is your reactionary part were just taking  this isnt a battle this is  liam yeah im backing it up im running man  matt all right so you go charging back onto the bridge as you go running all right both trolls  and the ogre have just gone off the side  laura badass  all cheer  matt you hear them screaming as they tumble into the darkness  liam im laughing as i run  travis didnt occur to me that there is a bridge  matt about four duergar also go spilling /none/ over the side screaming as they tumble into the darkness  travis yes  matt the rest of them stop kind of look around and  sam this was a great plan  orion i start as thats happening i start to pull back and float away and im commanding all of  my guys to come through the bridge because i can command them within 30 feet so theyre now  theyre all within 30 feet of me retreating as well  matt okay as this is happening you can now see some of the members of the duergar /none/ that are now at  the edge are some of the elite guard with the blackened armor you saw they both kinda step  forward and put their foot out feeling for purchase give a nod pull out their swords and  start hacking at the bridge immediately  sam gasps oh shit  laura shit  taliesin all right im taking a shot  laura can we does our aim reach our ranged attacks do they reach  sam whispers you fly  travis no hes got it  laura do ranged attacks reach  matt from this distance /none/ its gonna be a serious penalty  taliesin im not  matt you dont because you  taliesin im taking that shot because i can shoot forever  matt go for it  orion gunshot  liam im untying the carpet quickly  all laugh  taliesin oh for the love of god and all that is holy  marisha groans oh no  taliesin misfire i gotta  laura i can at least try right  matt go ahead and roll as you youre at disadvantage  laura fail so hard  matt as your arrow shooting sound off /none/ you gun misfiring sound and theres a slight delay and  you wonder why isnt it working and this horrible explosion sound bursts out as you can now  see black and red smoke pouring out of the front of the barrel of bad news and it burns your hands  for a second and youre like ah shit take a second to  taliesin all right so i gotta stop and clean  matt yeah however because you are unable to halt that  both of those duergar take shots at the bridge  taliesin damn it  matt /none/ both hit with their swords  marisha are you on the carpet vax  travis hes getting it out  liam i dont know i said i was  laura get on it now  matt as youre running and pulling the carpet out  liam yes  matt  the bridge is cut clean  laura gasps  marisha son of a

back of your /none/ head  laura oh no  liam mmhm  matt you guys looking across you can see now a familiar cloaked figure has emerged  all gasp  sam oh shit  liam i drew him out  laura clean your gun

stats oh  its your wisdom saving  liam wisdom okay  matt wisdom  liam ow not very good seven  matt seven  laura no  matt as you are running you get the carpet out you leap onto it and your whole sense and awareness  of your surroundings just fades from you you just feel your entire body going numb for a second and  you /none/ just feel yourself falling  marisha holy shit  laura fly down get him get

is falling fly  liam like superman  matt you cast fly on him all right  orion now fly damn it  matt he is still just kind of standing there not doing anything as you finish casting the fly  spell your fly spell dissipates because its a concentration spell  and you can have one at a given time  orion wait youre unconscious  liam i dont know what i am  orion i ask right now is he  marisha hes like /none/ catatonic  orion he is okay then i dont do that because you cant fly yourself  so i do grab him this time  matt okay you grab him as his whole weight goes onto you whats your strength  orion oh

on him you manage to  just pull him across and get him to the other edge the flying carpet however has plummeted  down in  all no  travis son of a bitch  laura you lost our flying carpet you unconscious bastard  matt however tiberius swoops up you guys just see them both plummet into darkness and then  flying up at the /none/ edge of the crevasse on your side tiberius clutching your brother currently  just staring off into space and dropping him down with a dull sound  laura vax  matt the bridge slaps onto the side of the cavern  liam mawp  laura and i run over to vax  liam mawp  laura and im like trying to figure out whats wrong with him  travis the magic carpet is done  matt it just disappeared into the darkness below  laura oh no  travis tearfully i have to erase it  marisha bye carpet  /none/ taliesin no  sam that was our ticket across the chasm  liam yes  marisha i loved that carpet damn it  matt about a minute passes or so you come back to your senses  laura oh good  liam i got to get the carpet  all laugh  taliesin can i clean my gun  orion i slap him with mage hand snap out of it  liam what happened what happened  travis wait do we leave or  laura no wait  taliesin they are still across there arent they  matt you can /none/ see across the way that there are a bunch of them just standing at the edge  taliesin i wanna take a shot at the  laura at the  liam noodleface yeah  matt okay go for it  laura oh man  sam you can see them and they control you  laura right in the noggin  liam shoot it in the eye man  orion not from that distance i dont think his sniper rifle goes far  taliesin hm thats a 23  matt okay go ahead and roll the damage across the way you /none/ can hear the resounding gunshot  taliesin ah yeah that dont suck 20 points of damage  matt 20 points of damage nice you just see this blast of red and flame across the way and  the figure is just knocked off its feet about ten feet back  all laugh  laura can you shoot him again  taliesin yes  marisha its just a carnival game for percy at this point  matt at this point in time you can now see the duergar looking up  and backing away from the cliff side  taliesin yeah /none/  matt you come to the bridge which is just dangling off the side now  liam were on the goblin side now  laura yeah  matt youre on the goblin side and the bridge is just dangling down into darkness  taliesin that felt pretty good too  liam who wants to have a picnic  orion i mean seriously  marisha so how many monster sounds are over there   matt you only saw the one  marisha and how many duergar left how many  orion yes how many are left after all that  /town/ marisha after they fell into  matt after all that you saw a few more kind of filter out from the town you have probably about  25 visible at that moment that have all backed  taliesin im going to hang on him visually and im gonna wait to take another shot  until he tries to stand up again  matt okay  taliesin so if he tries to stand up again i want to shoot him again  laura but wait you can shoot him while hes on the ground cant you  taliesin thats so much /none/ more fun to wait  matt you can shoot him but its at disadvantage to shoot someone whos prone  laura hes on the ground  matt yeah  taliesin technically hes got cover and its funnier to just wait  matt a moment passes and he kind of drifts back up take another shot  taliesin taking another shot  marisha come on percy  liam come on baby  taliesin hes such an asshole  marisha like fish in a barrel  liam come on von rolo  taliesin 15  matt 15 unfortunately it does not hit /none/  liam ricochet noise  matt at that distance with the darkness its very hard to get your bead on him at that point  so you gunshot fires off you can now see it drift away  laura fudge  matt  and all the rest of the duergar are now retreating into the city  taliesin man  laura whatre you gonna do all of our shits gone  marisha okay  travis okay whatre we gonna do leave  laura maybe we can can we walk up and see  orion lets take a short rest  /none/ laura  if we can find another bridge  orion while were figuring this out  matt if you want to okay so you walk over to the edge and you kind of look across to the  sides make a perception check  taliesin ill assist  laura oh 20  liam 20  taliesin never mind  laura no no assistance needed  matt natural 20  liam yeah  taliesin never mind  matt natural 20  laura  liam yes  matt plus  laura plus my perception  liam highpitched natural 20 motherfucker  laura /none/ my perception is six  liam highpitched automatic win  matt you glance over the side  all laugh  matt  and looking down you can see the bridge is just kind of like drifting from the air thats  flowing and you can just see the and its not like the whole bottom floor is all lava theres  just streaks of it pouring down from whatever the interior of this lower chasm is you see at the  edge of the rope break which goes down for a good 150 200 feet or so dangling  and /none/ theres a tiny little flicker of material  laura gasps  matt  wrapped up in the ropes of the rope bridge  laura oh my god  travis its the carpet  sam material its the carpet  matt its the carpet it seems to be the carpet  taliesin okay we have an infinite rope  marisha oh go  laura we have infinite rope im gonna tie it to myself  orion wait hold on a second  taliesin were gonna lower you down  orion is it still its just at the end of the all /none/ the way down there  matt mmhm  orion so i fly down there  laura no aww  orion  and go get it  sam yeah that makes sense  laura oh all right  orion its still in effect  matt mmhm  sam okay watch out for that warm air whatever that was  matt so  orion ooh youre right i take out an empty bottle while i do this  matt all right you glide down along the base of the cut rope bridge and there just barely  hanging on by just haphazardly /none/ falling and tangling itself in the ropes is the  flying carpet as you float down you now get a little bit of a better view as your staff is lit  you can see about another 150 feet down below you a little bit of a reflection of your light  its currently just kind of rippling and shifting  laura gasps its water down there  marisha and sam its water  matt it appears to be some sort of water surface below you about 150 feet down  sam i thought there was lava  travis i /none/ run and jump off the cliff  matt there are streaks of lava  laura no you dont  matt  pouring like from the ceiling and portions of the wall  travis yep and i jumped all the way down  laura its 1000 feet down  matt  but its all just kind of pouring down and pooling at the edges and then cooling  laura its 1000 feet  liam thats a big belly flop  travis i have great form in midair  sam so there its a river  orion and you dont know this /none/ yet  laura do you want to die  matt and you can see the waterfall its cascading over the side  travis its water  laura youre being incredibly childish dont do that  matt  is currently rushing past you at about 30 feet to your right and it seems to be splashing  into this pool below  laura dont dive 1000 fucking feet  orion waterfall ah  i retrieve the magic carpet  matt you grab the magic carpet you roll it up make your way back up to the surface  marisha carpet  /none/ orion ah here you are by the way cool stuff down there its actually not lava its water  aha believe it or not  laura water how far down from the bridge  orion its about 150 feet from the bridge but its about 1000 feet down all the way we could  traverse down somehow and i think it would be a nice place to go explore  sam place to go explore  orion especially because we have nothing else to do and  sam well we could go to the camp and go kick some  /none/ laura well look we know we cant get over there  sam but we have a carpet now  orion oh thats right  laura oh  travis yeah but we go over one at a time and then were waiting for  marisha ah fly me down with you  laura the thing is  sam the three of us can fly  marisha tiberius and i are going to fly down  laura the thing is we know that  marisha on the carpet  laura  deeper down is where theyve gone  marisha yes thats true /none/  laura so probably itd be best to go down we could have avoided all of this bullshit if wed  just have known  liam but we didnt know and if theres  marisha i dont wanna fight i dont wanna fight that guy  liam  if theres more than one of them these though hes gone boodleoodleooo to his friends  right now i mean  laura right  liam  if we can itd be good to put this guy in the ground  sam im all for going  marisha i dont know okay take /none/ me down  sam theres a tunnel back there  marisha hang on let me lets go see lets go see  sam  back past that village that theyre protecting  orion well im still flying you can take percy would you like to come  taliesin oh all right  marisha ive to ride the carpet down to the bottom with percy and tiberius  orion well i whoevers going down should be on the carpet cause i can still fly  marisha right  orion so i dont need it  marisha me and percy are on /none/ the carpet  matt all right so the two of you get on the carpet you drift down and you begin to make your  way down this giant crevasse as you get down the air gets warmer and warmer and you begin to see  as you come down a good 600 feet now at this point into this much larger space than the one  you guys are currently above its like a giant triangular open cavern down here it kind of  funnels up into where the bridge was  marisha do i see any tunnels or /none/ areas that look like it leads someplace of interest  matt as you look down there is definitely a large pool of water that leads off into a few  other underground rivers that spill off into the mountainside itself there are sections of the  wall where lava is pouring out where there seems to be some sort of a vent or some sort of opening  into some magma reserve and there are about three of them that are pouring out and kind of drifting  down one of them is pooling and cooling as it hits the /none/ water and its just kind of this  perpetually glowing mass of slowgrowing rock there also appears to be one that is just  continuing to flow that leads kind of back in the direction where you guys came but underneath  theres one big lava pool that is spilling and then kind of giving a little bit of light to the  inside of a tunnel that continues further down at a decline the opposite side  sam lava tunnels what are you crazy  marisha i keep going  sam sorry yes  matt thats okay  marisha /none/ are you done  matt on the opposite side you can see theres a small outcropping and a smaller waterfall that is  pouring out of the side of the mountain like another sea is now meeting the river underneath  and that is just kind of cascading out from the side of the rock dropping about 30 or 40 feet  and hitting the edge of the rock pool  marisha okay  liam on cthulhus side youre talking about  matt on cthulhus side yeah  orion i think we should  marisha i say tiberius give me /none/ some light  orion oh  marisha and i take and i cast control water and i just take the pool the water in the bottom  of the pool and i bend it and i part the pool and i take it and i cascade it all the way up  following the lava flows  matt okay just so youre aware the pool is about 600 feet across  all laugh  marisha i can part seas with this  matt right so you can part elements of it but like it is a large large large body /none/ of water  marisha oh okay okay well im taking okay i dont necessarily part it but i take the water  and i draw it up cascading along the edges following  all the lava streams going into the tunnels  matt okay another thing you notice is there are two trolls and an ogre currently trying to stay  afloat as one of them just sucking sound gets pulled under the water  laura gets pulled under  matt yes  sam yells  matt you begin moving the water to the sides and you begin to cool /dung/ some of the lava flows  orion oh thats awesome  matt you can see the glowing red magma begin to cool to a dark black and become solid as it does  you can see parts of it crack as the magmas still pushing out but youre definitely  staunching the flow  marisha im gonna kind of push it you said there was a tunnel kind of going up into cthulhu side  matt yeah there is a tunnel that seemed the opening leads to the back and theres a waterfall  that is pouring out from that /none/ side  orion waterfall  marisha theres a waterfall  matt waterfall  orion not a lava fall  matt the lava flow is going down the opposite direction  marisha but theres like a tunnel kind of carving out that way  matt yeah like a large opening that continues further down  marisha okay i take all of the water and i really just concentrate and i gather just a big  tube and i push it down that tunnel  matt okay so the best the water that you gather from this you force into a quick /none/ geyser in  that direction as it sprays across the front you can see it begins to cool some of the magma its  a pretty hefty flow you manage to slow it and you do cool parts of it but its gonna be  difficult and take you a while if youre just constantly pushing water on it to give the flow  any sort of serious stop you notice the lava flow doesnt coat the entire floor of the tunnel just  a side of it its almost like theres some portion of it that is walkable  /dung/ adjacent to the lava  orion we can also go in the notlava cave keyleth  marisha im sorry that lava cave just looks important  orion i know because of the lava  marisha yeah  orion lets go tell the others what weve found and then well  come back and decide which way to go  marisha okay okay  taliesin sometimes a lava cave is just a lava cave  orion i fly back up  matt okay  orion guys blahblahblahblah  sam so heres my thoughts  matt the other troll sucking sound pulled /none/ beneath the surface  sam yeah so i dont wanna go down there  marisha also it looks like theres something eating those trolls  sam  theres things pulling trolls yeah lets not go down there where theres things eating  trolls why dont we just  orion in the water  sam yeah  matt yeah in the giant water pool in the bottom  laura wait but were gonna have to go down eventually so  liam maybe  sam why  laura okay  sam why do we have to go down there theres nothing that /none/ we need down there  orion but across the way is a 25man battle with a huge nasty boss  sam theres seven of us and one of us is grog  laura well everybody keeps saying that everything is deeper and deeper so i think were  gonna have to go  marisha yeah  laura  deep down eventually  marisha i agree with vex on this one  liam well hold on  sam deep into the tunnels  liam all those assholes are still standing on the edge across there do we have weve flown out /none/ of  a falling tower before we were all able to do it can we just fly up and  over those shitheads and go towards the tunnel  orion not with the eye of that mind flayer  laura yeah it can grab us  marisha yeah look what it did to you  orion i dont trust it  laura exactly  liam cant we go 150 feet in the air and  laura the tunnel doesnt go that high  marisha i think you were at least 150 feet across that bridge when he did that to /none/ you  laura yeah it can grab us from there  sam we can try  liam i was on the bridge when that happened  matt you were on the bridge when that happened you were  liam  and fell down i wasnt way above  marisha but the bridge was like 250 feet across right  matt right you were about loosely 80 feet across when it got you  liam when it got me  orion so its range is probably like 100 feet  liam and you said its 150ish feet in here though to /none/ the ceiling  matt to the ceiling its about 150 feet yeah  liam we can go  laura but the tunnel oh  taliesin they have ranged weapons as well  laura quietly i think we should go down  sam but what is down there  travis if we dont find out  laura kima  travis you can drop me like a depth charge  sam but theres no sign of anything intelligent down there other than something thats eating  trolls underwater it could be just giant whales down there we have no idea theres no /none/ sign of  humans at all its lava and death animals  laura maybe okay if i go down there  orion theres more like tunnels that go further  laura  and look in one of the tunnels  marisha tunnels that go deeper  laura  can i look in one of the tunnels and see if i find tracks if i do can we go that way  sam howre you gonna go in the tunnels  laura ive got a flying carpet  sam theres lava  laura theres tunnels that dont have lava flowing into /dung/ them  sam if you burn  marisha and i can control water for at least an hour  orion theres so down there theres a big pool of water  marisha it lasts a while  orion  a tunnel going towards the mind flayer side with no lava  laura exactly  orion  and then theres another cave with lava  laura there is a tunnel that we can walk in  orion  that we can go going away from him  taliesin lets see if theres anything resembling tracks  laura yes  marisha ill /none/ go with vex thataway i can cool lava as we go  laura please scanlan let me look for tracks please  sam tracks in a river  laura tracks in a tunnel  sam its not that kind of a tunnel  laura it is  sam theres water flowing in it  matt there is on okay in a giant cavern there is towards the side where you guys kind of  entered underneath where you first came in  laura yes  matt  there is a descending large tunnel of which there are a series of /town/ lava flows that kind  of pool into one river of lava that covers half of that path down  laura okay  liam in the direction of goblin town  matt correct  laura okay  matt towards the other side the  liam the cthulhu side  matt the cavern ends and there is a waterfall pouring out of the side of the wall  sam cant go in there  matt  that just kind of flows down  sam oh so theres a cavern opening  matt no no there is a there well there is /none/ essentially a hole where water is pouring out of  sam cant go in there  laura oh  marisha we can go in there  taliesin but we can go in the one with lava  sam theres water pouring out of it  marisha i can make that stop happening  sam but what would we find in a tunnel with water pouring out of it  its not like anything lives up there  marisha im just i would much rather face random beasts who are just random beasts than  mind flayers who can suck my /none/ brain out  taliesin there would be no random beasts though its just nothing but plumbing  liam yes but kima did not fall prey to random beasts she fell prey to these shits  laura all right fine lets do whatever you guys want to do  marisha i think i dont think a boss battle i dont think we can fight this guy and win  travis vote vote for fucks sake vote put it to a vote  liam vote yes  sam all right all in favor of going to the duergar village and facing the /none/ giant fucker  liam up and over up and over  sam or up and over or at least getting past it that direction thats four of us  travis thats four  sam all in favor of going into the lava flows to find something  laura water holes  liam water holes or fire holes  marisha water holes  sam mm mm  marisha tiberius you havent voted  orion a draconian does not vote  travis what are you switzerland cmon  laura its four against us anyway  marisha a draconian you come from a /none/ political family  laura we gotta go that way  orion well i dont vote i dont believe in our system anyway thats none of your business  sam are you a communist  all laugh  orion i dont know what that means  liam now tiberius can fly keyleth is an eagle who can carry a gnome and maybe my sister  laura ugh no  liam and that leaves percy and grog and i on the flying carpet can it hold our weight lets give  it a little test  laura and trinket  marisha okay /none/ well if this doesnt work

below the cavern  liam the mind flayer isnt on pause  laura okay i could i have wait i have a  orion that was gonna go right in my mouth  laura i have a lantern  matt okay  laura yeah cause i have a dungeoneering kit  taliesin oh cool yellow  matt all right so you pull out your lantern as the two of you are going down towards the water  laura part the water  matt /none/  the rest of you kind of

flayers saying gravelly voice i havent got all day  marisha  and i reverse it  matt all right so as you guys float down  orion i follow  matt  the two trolls that were missing the ogre is not anywhere to be seen  travis fly you /none/ fools  liam laughs  matt  theres just a slight ripple in the waters surface  laura we dont wanna land we just wanna go towards the tunnel  matt right as you staunch the water supply of this waterfall it just kind of holds it in place  with enough of a force that the water coming out is being balanced by the force youre putting back  on it its just kind of holding it there  laura can you lower the water so we can fly  matt however as the water vanishes beneath where the /none/ waterfall was you can see an actual  small tunnel thats carved into the rock  laura fuck all yall bitches  taliesin whoa laughs  liam well wanna go down  laura lets go in there  travis that doesnt do anything yet we dont know  laura lets go into the tunnel  sam meanwhile back up top im saying theyre not gonna find anything  theyre not gonna find any tunnels  all laugh  travis yeah im agreeing with scanlan and i am mooning off the cliffs face  laura so im stealthing lets stealth lets /none/ be very quiet  marisha okay  orion hold on  matt all right  laura can you turn into an animal  orion i fly back up to tell them whats going on  marisha oh i can  i go into a black panther form  matt okay  liam scanlan remember when we had women in this party  laura okay and i stealth  sam laughs  matt okay both of you guys roll stealth  marisha panthers have like advantage on stealth

laura oh were going okay you guys are joining us all right  orion i was  marisha no we were scouting  laura im just looking for tracks right now tiberius  orion yeah and i /none/ followed you saw what

matt no you guys stepped off the carpet she said and you transformed began stealthing in  marisha oh thats right we did transform okay sure you can take the carpet  matt as youre doing that you turn around and see tiberius had rolled the carpet  and /none/ is currently taking it away  laura you motherfucker  matt so you guys are on the bottom of this crevasse and tiberius disappears into the darkness  okay well go ahead and roll this would be survival for tracking  just to get an idea for anything around you see  laura 16  matt you do see some scratches into the mud of the surface there that lead into a tunnel you see  drag marks you see footprints and thats the best you can make out at this in this point in  time but the footprints /none/ appear to be dwarven or dwarfsized in nature  marisha can i do a nature check to see what the scratch marks look like if they look like any  type of beast i might recognize  matt the scratch marks are across the ground it looks just like fingers being pulled through  marisha any type of residue any type of slime  matt no that you can tell no  laura can we see where the tunnel leads  matt from what you can see theres no  light source in there  laura we have the light /none/ remember when i  matt so you take a lantern and put it inside the tunnel goes back about 25 feet and then stops  its just a little alcove you see within the tunnel a series of  skeletons or bodies that are partially decomposed  taliesin oh god  matt and you see what looks like a pile of rags in the corner  travis go check it out  laura so we can either run or loot what should we do  travis no go check it out ladies  sam theyre not gonna find anything  /none/ marisha theyre telling us not to be stupid because we dont have support  should we be stupid  travis grog says yes  laura oh im so scared but okay heres the thing  i remember another situation very similar to this  orion it was terrible  laura and it was the lair of one of those umber  hulks  marisha right why dont we just go back maybe to the entrance of the  liam vexahlia what is going on down there  travis no no no no be thorough  all laugh  laura oh /none/ brother i think we found the lair of the umber hulk  travis are you sure  laura oh pretty damn sure  matt its very well the actual tunnel is maybe about five to eight feet across and it would not  be able to fit an umber hulk  laura oh really can i go along the walls very stealthily  and see if i can find any opening anything else  matt as you step inside and put your hands across the walls  taliesin and laura oh god oh  matt what you do notice is /none/ the walls are solid this appears to have been carved out over time  and as you move in you begin to see the rags and the pile of rags is less a pile of rags and more  some sort of humanoid curled up in on the inside unconscious asleep or dead not moving  marisha what is she what do they look like  matt you cant tell from here its just like kind of curled over in the corner  travis go in there  taliesin id like to roll a save against smugness really quickly can /none/ i save against smugness i  feel a wave of smugness in here  matt i think you might youre not saved against smugness percy  laura keyleth i think you should turn into an eagle can she turn into  something big enough that can carry me  matt she can yeah a giant eagle i believe you can  laura what if you turn into something big enough that it can carry me i hop on your back and we  throw something at it and then fly away  all laugh  matt while you guys are /none/ having this conversation cause youre talking to each other  laura fuck we were talking really quietly  matt  the thing in the corner kind of rouses and shoots up out of sudden fear movement looking  about you see dressed in rags you guys are seeing this for the first time but its familiar  smooth head purplish and blue in color a series of tentacles in its mouth a giant scar drawn  across one of its eyes and it looks filthy and it looks desperate and just looks at the two of  you and you /none/ hear a sudden voice in your minds  laura oh fuck  matt no movement just conversation saying  what who are you  marisha i drop to my knees and i look at him and just say its okay were friends  matt he puts up a hand like this and you see theres a flicker of arcane energy and a barrier  appears between you and this creature and just looks  marisha i take my druidcraft and i just make a little flower  laura oh my god  all laugh  marisha and theres a pretty /none/ little tulip and i lay it at the edge of the barrier  liam gollum voice nasty  matt make a persuasion check  all laugh  matt with disadvantage  marisha with disadvantage okay nine  matt okay nine total  laura oh no  marisha im not a very charismatic person  matt it holds its place and the voice again hits your mind and says  how did you find me what is your purpose here  orion i fly back down  travis no no no  laura we dont mean to disturb you great sire /none/  matt you will die if you try anything  laura were not going to  matt i will not fall here i will not die here  laura we mean to help you we mean to find our way out and find our friend thats all  marisha we dont want to die either  laura please who did this to you we can help you  marisha lets not die together  matt you can see as you get a better look at it it definitely has a large scar across part of its  face and it /none/ looks to be wearing remnants of a robe similar to what scanlan was describing  however it is tattered its dirtied sullied by the elements and god knows what other liquids it  also has this strange kind of metallic skull cap thats currently placed around its head  and it just leave me in peace then or give me a reason not to slay you where you stand  liam whispers revenge  laura we can help you get revenge against your brethren who did this to you  matt theres a slight change in mood you just feel /none/ revenge  laura yes  matt make a persuasion check  travis roll the shit out of that new dice  marisha come on vex  laura 19  orion yes  matt the barrier flickers and dissipates it reaches over and grabs what looks like a gnarled  stick pulls itself up onto its legs now what looked like a small minuscule creature is now  even in his terrible hunched form is standing extremely tall like scraping the top of this  maybe eightfoottall ceiling in this tunnel  marisha meekly hi  matt it takes a step /none/ forward and says  revenge you speak of revenge this is a  language i wish to know very well  marisha you found the right motley crew  all laugh  laura should we bring it with us  marisha would you like to come with us  laura to leave this cavern  marisha meet our friends we have friends  matt it kind of gives you both a look and you hear this theres a slight lurching to it as it  gives this horrible guttural low chuckle friends thats a word i havent heard in a /none/ long  time not one i take to heart but allies in time that i can understand  take me to your allies  laura tiberius  orion mm yes  laura maybe you can send that fucking carpet back down  all laugh  orion ill be right there i was trying to get the rest of the party here but everyones  being buttholes i fly back down with the carpet  matt you come down with the carpet at the edge of this opening you see keyleth you see  vex both emerge with a horrible tentaclefaced /none/ gnarled being with a staff coming out with them  orion hello  marisha tiberius  orion oh did you make a friend  marisha we did see friends  orion wonderful  marisha this is whats your name  matt looks about to you then looks at tiberius and says ignoring your question  you have persuasion to the arcane  orion yes im a sorcerer i do all kinds of fun things with the arcane  matt

are up  matt he carefully steps on the carpet once again like its tentacles are slithering noises  laura i keep a distance  matt moving around its mouth and its /none/ eyes are constantly darting it looks extremely nervous and  almost like a cornered animal thats just barely being coaxed onto this journey you see with each  step it takes there a slight flicker of arcane energy at the tip of its fingers like its just  prepared for anything to go terribly wrong it steps onto the carpet and goes  take me to your allies  orion ah yes we have wonderful allies  marisha you can even maybe call them friends even  laura not just yet  matt it crosses its legs and sits on /none/ the carpet holding its staff to its chest on the far corner  staring at all of you and says go now  laura hold on tight  matt you guys make your way up to the top eventually you see the carpet whoosh over the  edge of the crevasse come down to a rest as your party has now  brought with you the stuff of nightmares  all laugh  sam that is the thing i saw in the village  laura hold on hold on  travis what is that oh my god  matt at /none/ which point its leapt off at this point hovering about and you can see this crackle  of fire in its hand and it goes panicked noises  laura no no  orion im standing between them like its okay these are the allies we speak of  laura peace friends we are ourselves  orion grog dont do anything  laura we are not controlled  orion dont use a whip scanlan sing a friendly song as he is our friend ally to the  guy ally he is hes in a little spot of trouble and we are /none/

matt he kind of gives you this keen look of huh  the least person i expected to ask a question  all laugh  matt it kind of hobbles forward with its gnarled staff and says i was cast out from my hive i  was cursed with the mark of the /none/ arcane my people see that as an ill omen i was discarded left to die  laura lets destroy your hive  matt no  laura no  matt you see the hive is sick the mind that keeps us safe is no longer its own  orion oh  matt one an alien one has come and taken the mind hostage it has taken my people as its own  playthings i was able to escape its mental grasp  it reaches up and taps the metal on its head  laura oh tinfoil hat  marisha and taliesin /none/ magneto helmet  marisha this is the guy weve needed this whole time  matt my people will not so easily escape its grasp  they are now under the control of this creature  marisha so if we did it  sam if we find this creature we might be able to free your hive as well  matt that would be why i wish to have your alliance  laura yes  matt help me free our hivemind free my people  travis whispers sense motive  laura oh yeah can we sense motive on him  matt /none/ laughs you definitely can  laura oh

laughs four  /none/ liam four  travis 16  sam 13  travis happy scream 16  all laugh  matt okay  sam youre a people person  matt through your intense grasping this creatures disposition best you can as alien and  unfamiliar as its mannerisms and speech and interests may be you get the feeling that its  speaking out of desperation and its speaking out of genuine interest youve piqued it with the hint  of revenge youve piqued it with the idea of alliance as opposed to being alone you get the  feeling that it speaks the /none/ truth it genuinely is asking for your help in freeing its people from  whatever is influencing their current actions  laura clarota laughs  sam whats his name  laura clarota  matt clarota  sam can we just call him clarence  all laugh  liam jimmy stewart voice clarence clarence  taliesin clara it could be a she  laura we are very interested in being allies with you might we have your word that upon defeating  this creature we will be safe  sam and as a symbol of our dedication to you id love /none/ to play you just a little bit of a song that  might heal some of those wounds and scrapes that you seem to have all over your body  matt he gives you the dirtiest look youve ever received  travis whispers it was because of the arcane  sam its a pretty good song  matt make a persuasion check  all laugh  liam come on burt reynolds  sam hm ooh 17  all laugh  matt he
