none	 big exercise balls to just wing  them there  matt yeah no shit and you know what im stronger for it so thank you guys youve been  training me with weights on for two years now  liam you have passed through fire  matt so last we left off vox machina having completed their venture over the past few arcs  having freed whitestone from the tyranny of the briarwoods having brought down the chroma  conclave and essentially brought freedom back to taldorei you closed up some loose ends keyleth  finished her aramente and you 
none	 all went to your business for a yearlong time jump you returned  and each of you recounted the things you wished to accomplish in that year culminating in a winters  crest beachside vacation in the bay of gifts at the port of shamel which involved some escalating  pranks  laura wait a minute is it really the bay of gifts with a t  matt yes with a t  laura i seriously thought its the bay of gifs this whole time  taliesin the bay of jifs  laura im sorry okay i understand now  
none	 liam retcon  matt and it is so named because it is such a centralized port for trade across the various  continents in that area so its a place where its affluent and its funny its kind of  ironic cause everything there is expensive as you found out but nevertheless you returned to  your home in whitestone and reconvened especially after building your bake shop in  whitestone but shes not paying attention so thats fine  laura im sorry he was distracting me  matt thats okay anyway so  travis fucking twins  matt laughs 
none	 i know seriously but upon situating yourselves after youve returned and  enjoying this peaceful period of recovery and expansion of whitestone itself there was an  arrival on the outskirts of the city there was a cart horses pulling a group of four gnomes that  all eventually revealed themselves to be family of pike trickfoot after taking them in whether or  not you were excited or eager to nevertheless you treated them with hospitality you gave them a  place to stay you gave them food for the evening conversations were had information was passed  around 
none	 and a handful of you upon listening in on some of the conversations and pushing for  information with the eldest of them uncle ogden discovered some sort of true purpose as to why  they came to whitestone dealing with apparently a longrunning blood curse that lies in the  trickfoot family and ogden having visions had along with the rest of the family that takes care  of him made their way towards whitestone as the information gathered by jb trickfoot the esteemed  keeper of knowledge about your journey over the past year or so and the 
none	 exploits of her cousin  pike has told you so that being the case youve promised them a tour of the grounds and  perhaps seeking more information about what the next steps are in regarding this curse if there  are any so with that you all finish your evening eating of your meals drinking deep of  your cups and eventually finding yourselves resting til the night took you and sleep was had  the morning comes you wake up rested and the day is yours what do you wish to do  laura i think we had 
none	 talked about going to see pikes greatgrandfather wilhand to talk about  the curse with him right  travis dont look at me i have a tour to give  laura right grog and percival you were going to help with that tour  taliesin yes  laura to keep him out of trouble  travis what  laura huh  marisha maybe keep an eye on them make sure they dont have sticky fingers  travis they dont wash their hands  laura not very often you saw how much candy they were eating yesterday  travis thats really 
none	 disgusting  liam do you want to do the talking and ill keep an eye on hands  taliesin i think between the three of us it should be fine if  the rest of you want to go and  marisha talk to wilhand  taliesin  talk to wilhand and see what information you can glean  marisha percy  taliesin yes  marisha i have a question  taliesin all right  marisha ogden in his ramblings mentioned a shadowy figure with burning coal eyes this  doesnt sound like anything that youre familiar with does it 
none	  taliesin well i mean yes but that is honestly like saying a man with brown hair of average  height when it comes to these sorts of creatures it could be anything its kind of the effect they  go for  marisha how did orthax take his form with you  taliesin no glowing eyes  marisha no glowing eyes  taliesin no so theres that  laura he had a birdlike thing in the face  taliesin a bit of smoke lots of smoke and birdlike  liam its quite an aesthetic  marisha but you think 
none	 it might still be of the same fiendish nature  taliesin honestly who knows we dont know enough yet its too general  liam it could also potentially be bullshit  taliesin it could also potentially be bullshit well know more when they decide to open up or if  your travels for information bear fruit  marisha should we bring wilhand back here  taliesin i imagine that depends on him  laura if he wants to come  sam were taking pike to wilhand i mean  laura yes  sam pike you want to go see wilhand 
none	 right  taliesin highpitched oh yes  sam oh ill take that as a yes  matt get here soon ashley please have you guys informed pike of this information  laura oh yeah yeah we talked about it last time  matt at the end of the last yeah so shes like i mean i think we should right  marisha well how about you guys go on your tour  laura first i mean well head over there while you guys do  sam simultaneously but well leave just a moment later  marisha yeah theoretically  taliesin 
none	 so while this is both happening at the same time therell be some sort of narrative  distance  marisha yeah just a little  liam what are you saying  taliesin i dont know i just had this weird aneurysm just hit my brain im not entirely sure  what it was  marisha just so when historians look back and they want a detailed timeline of our lives  liam life is not a book  laura well it depends on who you ask  taliesin have you met my friend lord fourth wall  laura she wants 
none	 to go see wilhand pike definitely wants to go see wilhand  marisha well see you in 24 hours  laura well head towards the old sun tree  mat as you guys head down you pass by the dining hall for breakfast and there you already see  astra and johann are in the process of having their own breakfast by that i mean you see  astra whos currently handstitching new clothing from a clump of highquality silks that she seems  to have pulled from a number of noble dresses that are left within their guest quarters 
none	 of  whitestone as you glance on the table theres a number of them folded over but sections have been  cut out theres a pair of scissors on the side and shes currently stitching through as you walk  in she glances up and goes  ive needed some new dresses for far too long  yall have some fine cloth here  laura were those those didnt belong to your  taliesin oh theres more a few more at least so yes  matt and you watch as she fans out this new blouse its not the finest 
none	 craftsmanship but  functional enough she goes sighs rubs it against her face thats nice  and squeezes into it  laura i go and grab a servant and tell them to quickly remove all of the clothing from the  wardrobes in the guest quarters so that they dont do it again  taliesin anything that hasnt been cut yet yes please  matt right away lady rushes off quickly as this is happening johanns in the process of  eating a breakfast that primarily consists of just fine cakes he has clusters of dried baked good  around 
none	 the outside of his mouth and caught in his mustache hes freshly washed his hair freshly  combed over and slicked with whatever equivalent of pomade he carries with himself and as you walk  by you see this like he has the plate and theres just a crumbcircle around it that has  emerged and is in the process of his gluttonous eating he stops and goes such delicacies are a  rare treat you have to make time to enjoy the little things in life dont you at least when  the opportunity arises  taliesin ah a 
none	 fairy circle make a wish ah anyway we were hoping to gather the clan and take  you on a tour of the estate when youre prepared  matt pulls up his shirt and dabs at his mouth it barely touches any of the actual food thats  around his mouth area he stops and goes right right of course of course well just wait for  old ogden to find his way down hes a bit of a stickler when it comes to his time so be patient  sit down lets have a meal why not get to 
none	 know each other a little better yes  travis we do gotta wait for uncle og by the way since im the tour guide do you have any plumey  hats you know cause if you take like a campus tour they have a flag and theyre like  over here in case you get lost or like when tourists walk around and theyre like dont get left mm  do you have anything like that  taliesin let me check ill be right back  travis good  laura ill go with him  sam what campus tours have 
none	 you been on  laughter  liam is trinket here  laura yes  liam trinket breakfast right around the little guy there go on free food  matt at which point as youre having this conversation the large bear starts lumbering up  armor clattering as it approaches the table with absolutely no care or interest in the gnomish guy  at the table who immediately goes oh mymymymy and he backs out the center of his  seat as the bear immediately impact sounds paws up and slurps starts licking up the crumbs and  pieces of wayward 
none	 pastry that have not found their way to the gnomes mouth at which point he stands  up off of his chair and rights himself hm well im stuffed lets go see how ogdens doing astra  ill be let me just finish this  all right well pick you up in a second ill go check in on ogden  and he gets up and walks past up the stairs you are searching for what  taliesin oh well ive gone into my sisters bedroom and have begun to raid the spring clothing  to find the most ostentatious 
none	 hat i can find and start shoving as many  things into it as i possibly can  matt make an investigation check please  laura i was going with you i had said i went with you mostly to get away from the gnomes  matt so youre both searching  taliesin yes  matt so make an investigation check with advantage  taliesin 15  matt okay takes you a little bit and youre being careful not to be too loud cause the last  thing you want is cassandra to come in and watch you tearing through 
none	 her outfits but you do find  what essentially amounts to a widebrimmed captains hat it comes almost to a tricorner  point at the front and curves upward its mostly used for costuming purposes its reminiscent of  masquerade balls its used for you actually recall when she was younger it was part of her  masquerade ball wear there was a mask with a long nose  taliesin sure and itll be very illfitting now  laura ooh are there any ribbons around  matt yeah you find ribbons easily enough  laura i wanna tie a big 
none	 purple giant bow around the top of it  taliesin get a feather in there get the whole thing really so its very hard to lose him  matt make a dexterity check  laura to see if i can tie a bow okay oh thats a saving throw this is low but thats a 12  matt okay  laura its a bow  matt oh no you successfully laughs you successfully create what is a bombastic bow of  varying layers that plumes out three times it resembles ribbon candy almost in the way that it  billows 
none	 out multiple ways but it is pinned to the top so it poofs as it cascades down the sides of  the hat  taliesin are we missing something i dont know is it finished  laura a big feather like a white plumey feather  taliesin i think we probably have a white plumey feather oh wait  laura or any color really  taliesin im gonna look to see if i can find some bells  matt okay not in cassandras room but there is the royal stable not far away which does have  bells available in 
none	 case they want to have parade accoutrements for the various horses and other  afforded creatures  laura are these like jingle bells or big cow bells  matt no theyre like jingle bells  taliesin all right im actually going to send you on that one since you have the broom well  need two ill find a feather all right im going to just take a quill basically and stick  it in there i dont even care  marisha youre making a derby hat thats appropriate  taliesin i know its wonderful  matt so yeah over 
none	 the next ten minutes or so between your journey and your finding the proper  feather plume you guys manage to cobble together a delightfully ostentatious hat for grogs  presentory tour of whitestone  laura i want the bells to hang from either side like around his ears right here  matt okay okay cool there you go he has a couple of dangly bells  taliesin i needed this  travis itll be good itll be like karate kid with the toy when he starts spinning it  matt perfect  travis oh bells in my face  
none	 laughter  matt this magnificent mess of a hat that you guys have created is on par if not slightly beyond  the previous helmet that he had acquired while in syngorn  taliesin yeah the horn helmet was pretty spectacular  but i feel like we may have topped it  matt so with that completed what do you wish to do  marisha i turn to jb real quick  matt well jb hasnt come down yet  marisha oh  matt actually while theyre doing this you guys are waiting kind of having your own meals and 
none	  getting the day started eventually you see johann come down the spiral stairs that lead back  to the main entryway to the castle and behind you see jb helping uncle ogden down step by step  he still has his walking staff as he makes his way down and they slowly make their way into the  dining hall sit down and a simple meal of very very soft oatmeal is presented for uncle ogden at  their request before resting the night before and jb gets her breakfast and johann is proud of the  fact that 
none	 he managed to acquire them though it was not much of an ordeal on his end goes and  joins astra and they seem to be eagerly awaiting the eventuality of this tour that theyre all  excited for so you now can approach jb if youd like  marisha my question has been answered by their arrival so never mind  sam was it what does jb stand for  taliesin what does jb eat  marisha it was how long does ogden take to get ready in the morning but now i know  laura what does jb 
town	 stand for  travis i have a question for astra  sam junior bacon cheeseburger  laughter  travis best name ever  sam that is a great name  travis new favorite asterix look is there anything in whitestone that you would fancy like  do you have any particular interests whether they be art or education or geometry or buildings  matt to be honest i just kinda want to see the history i wanna see how long its been here i  wanna see makes up the entirety of this crazy place i havent been inside a 
none	 castle before so  this is a new experience for me  travis right did you want to see just the castle or did you want the grand deluxe poobah  tour which is around whitestone as well  matt well how could i say no to that honey  travis thats what i mean yeah that was a really good deal okay let me confer with my  subordinate and well put together a tour package  matt im excited  travis okay  laura shes a little bitch  laughter  travis hey percy  taliesin yes  
none	 travis so asterix says that she wants history of whitestone and the castle so like i need a  hotlist of things that were gonna show her but can we make it sound like i thought of it  taliesin yes  travis okay good just keeping you on your toes mate  liam hes not talking to himself we all have earrings hes talking to the others if you were  wondering  matt right im not one to judge i mean youve seen ogden and you glance over at ogden whos  now in the process of trying 
none	 to comb the oatmeal out of his beard while hes muttering below his  breath incoherent muttering  liam are you coming with buddy  matt what  liam do you want to go on the tour  matt of course  liam huh can we borrow trinket for that oh vex isnt here im sure we could borrow trinket for  the day you ever ridden a bear old man  matt snoring  taliesin we actually have a carpet we were thinking of using for this  liam the bears funnier though  marisha hey vax  liam 
none	 hello oh im right here  marisha yeah im sitting next to you  liam are we not actually in the castle right now go ahead  marisha theres no ceiling i think he fell asleep with his eyes opened  matt which he did hes staring at you beginning to snore loudly and jbs like ogden ogden  she flicks him in the side of the head and he goes chomps and takes the spoon that shes  holding out with the oatmeal and just  travis i like him  liam i thought id get you a bear 
none	 ride but i was wrong im sorry  matt get me a beer  liam yeah can we get three beers in here  travis shit we dont even need the servants for that i just pop out the chalice little morning  beer sunrise  liam there you go three beers for you grandpa  marisha you know i heard a recipe the other day for a beermosa its like a mimosa but with beer  and orange juice would you like a beermosa ogden  matt no  marisha okay okay  travis oh shit oh god  
none	 matt and jbs like ogden she helps him put it back down on the table  ah its been years since ive had a good drink  travis years  matt yes  liam oh shit well were all gonna die have another one  matt and you can see jbs looking kind of nervous shes like  actually he probably shouldnt and she takes  him and pushes the drink toward grog  hes like im a grown boy  travis he is hes very grown  matt she seems outnumbered and extremely uncomfortable in the circumstance as you 
none	 look  over at johann whos like laughs oh this is gonna be a fun tour boy as he watches as uncle  ogden lifts the what by his size is rather large cup of beer thats the one its been a long  week finishes it in three massive gulps sets it down  liam man i couldnt do that  marisha you know im kind of sad im missing this tour with you guys now  travis yeah you fucked up  marisha yeah its gonna be fun  liam the grand poobah tour yes you are  
none	 travis gohan what happens when uncle ogden has too much you know drinking sound  matt i dont know honestly hes been off the wagon for about 20 years so im curious to see  liam well this calls for a celebration  marisha what did we do were the worst  travis life begins anew in whitestone  sam you know 20 years to a gnome is like five for a human  marisha we are consistently the worst  sam im just saying it could be okay  liam a very wise man once said that life needs 
none	 things to live so  taliesin and one of those things it needs is beer  laura he says as we walk in the room  matt carrying a magnificent hat in your hand  travis does ogden seem to grow younger as he finishes the beer  matt no he seems to grow the same  travis okay never know never know  matt he seems relatively unfazed  laura grog we found your tour hat  travis oh you did  laura and its wonderful  travis oh great when do i get to see it  laura 
none	 it was sitting on a special shelf labeled tour hat shelf  travis thats lucky  laura yeah it really was  sam is that it what you have there percy that hat  taliesin yes here we are  liam oh shit  taliesin magnificent isnt it  travis wow this is it jingles it jangles this is an official whitestone tour hat  laura yeah  taliesin so that we can definitely find you no matter what  travis yeah now is there a long history of distinguished tour leaders before me  taliesin you would think that 
none	 but honestly i dont believe that weve ever had an official tour  guide before you you would be starting  liam first vex now you  laura grand poobah and first tour captain of whitestone  liam all of this and that  taliesin this technically falls under this and that doesnt it  marisha keyleth bows and i take vax with me by hitting the back of his knees  taliesin its customary to show respect by jingling the bells  matt as you both bow and you say this phrase you watch as johann and astra  
none	 they bow low as well  travis yes percy you should tell them the short names for my titles you know  taliesin i think its just so much more exciting when you say it  travis what was it like silly bean and sweet chestnut  taliesin why not  travis yeah  laughter  taliesin grand poobah of all of this and that  travis please rise rise its going to be a lovely day  we have a lot ahead of us we do please  liam jeez that hat is busier than kvarns whole fucking  
none	 laura i know right  travis is it like wellbalanced  matt no not at all  travis i have to hold it  matt no heres the thing it was designed for a much smaller head so even for you to get it on  its like squeezing a tiny rubber thimble over your thumb so its like creaking boop it  pops up on the very very tip so it holds itself but it only really covers the very very top of  your head  travis id be worried about circulation up there but its not really 
none	 a concern  matt you feel like it might fall off but eventually you find a little strap inside  travis ooh  laura hey  travis fuck you  laughter  liam ding dingaling doodleding  travis i was cool until the strap came in  taliesin breaking point  travis i hate those fucking straps  taliesin the breaking point is right beneath your chin who knew  sam birthday hat  taliesin been searching for years  matt and as the strap finds itself solid across your jawline the gnomes one by one line up  behind 
none	 you looking at you excitedly ogden and jb at the rear and hes like whats going on  taliesin we pull out the carpet and invite ogden and jb  laura please take a seat  liam yes its no bear but its pretty good  matt you see johann and astra arminarm walk to the side and as jb takes the arm of uncle  ogden walks him forward he stumbles up in your direction looks up and goes  thats terrible where are we going  travis it is time for the tour of whitestone  matt yay 
none	  laughter  matt jb pats him and is like hes not very good with the volume control  travis oh thats okay i like it when theyre loud actually i relate  taliesin i understand  travis yep  laura which one of you two will be riding the carpet with them  liam of the grand poobah and myself  laura of you and percy percys going with you as well arent you are you  or are you coming with us  liam the carpets above my station  grog yeah i cant ride ive developed a 
none	 tour walk  laura someone has to ride the carpet with them  taliesin ill ride the carpet so that you can stay free for yes right  marisha oh shes coming with us  taliesin i know i know  marisha youre on your own  taliesin ill be fine  laura my darling  taliesin yes  laura youll be fine  taliesin oh god  travis all right percy time to learn about your castle and i take off in a walk where you dont  bend your knees your legs just stay straight thats the walk 
none	 im adopting for this whole tour  matt all right  travis ive decided  laura like legs going out to the side there  travis no like you kick your heel forward like  sam like a goosestep  travis like a military  sam goosestepping  marisha i dont think you want to do a goosestep  travis no im doing it  taliesin im okay with it  marisha you sure  taliesin lets roll with this  marisha okay  taliesin im totally fucking down im in  liam as we head out i run over 
none	 to keyleth and say try not to be too jealous and i give her a  smooch and then i chase after the gang  marisha have fun  liam oh i will  matt all right so the three of you find your way borrowing the carpet temporarily you gather  the gnomes so wait who the weight of all the gnomes the goliath  travis im walking  matt youre walking  laura its just percy and the gnomes  taliesin its just me like like a gondola driver  marisha yes and grog is like sherpaing  
none	 matt all right so  liam my plan is to act casual but to be watching all the gnomes for thieving things  matt okay easy enough all right so as you all leap onto the carpet except for grog grog you  begin taking them around the grounds you begin through the castle where do you want to begin  travis oh this foyer of whitestone castle was defended by myself and these fellows against the  onslaught of dragons giants and hordes of undead it has been in the de rolo family for  millennia  sam millennia 
none	 that last word  travis is that what the word is yep yep  laughter  travis and then i take them outside to get some fresh air before i overwhelm them with knowledge  matt laughs all right the carpet glides you guys to the outskirts of the castle you begin  taking them along the grounds around the perimeter wall and then through one of the  underneath gates to the back garden which youve recovered and are now starting to actually grow  again you have like a small hedge maze back there some rose gardens and 
town	 a small pond youve  filled in the exhaust holes that were used for the distillation of the whitestone and the acid pits  that were installed by the briarwoods now it is actually a garden once more and so as this  happens you watch as astra gets really excited at the edge of the carpet and is like ooh my look  at this place its like natural  laura laughs its like natural  travis natural beauty it abounds it all comes from the sun tree in the center of town  whispers percy help  taliesin 
none	 the gardens were originally constructed by melanie de rolo who is actually one of more  interesting de rolos of the time she was of the third generation to be born into this castle  matt snores  laughter  matt uncle ogden is just staring forward  taliesin dont know why i bother melanie is  travis asterisk is interested  taliesin  melanie was actually fascinating she was eventually removed from her position for  accusations of witchcraft and raising of the undead theres actually quite a bit of  interesting ghost stories if thats your sort of 
none	  travis no no we dont we dont nope no  matt no please thats interesting johann is like ghost stories you say huh  taliesin oh yes the strange materials that are mined in this part of the world have given rise to  all sorts of stories due to its pale appearance the fact that under certain types of moonlight it  can glow with a strange phosphorescent supernatural glow  there are even tales of people  matt snores  taliesin  seeing several of the more notorious de rolos as spirits wandering about the halls  
none	 melanie just being one of them but she was very excited by the notion of a garden and actually  originally many of these paths were  matt both of the gnomes now turn back to grog and go anyway whats next on the tour  taliesin thank you  laughter  travis enough with like the boring shit  taliesin i could keep going  travis do we have like an armory that we can bring them where they make weapons  sam yeah yeah get to the good shit  taliesin well actually why dont we take them 
none	 to target practice im sure that the riflemen are  probably at least doing a round of target practice that might be fun to see  liam do we get to see the musketeers  taliesin im not allowed to call them that anymore  liam well i will lets go  matt johann is like i like the sound of target practice thats right up my alley  take us there boy  travis okay we now venture along these roads cast through the ages of de rolo descendants as we  make our way to the annals of 
none	 firecracker alley  laughter  taliesin its a shooting alley its fun its got some moving bits but im sure you can  understand exactly what it entails  matt they both shake their head i have no idea what youre talking about but lets go  taliesin this is quite possibly the only one in existence so this is quite exciting  matt all right as you guys make your way along the rest of the tour the rest of you who are not  on this tour what are you doing  laura were going to the sun 
none	 tree  marisha were gonna go find wilhand  ashley were gonna go find wilhand  marisha were gonna go find willhand  matt okay  ashley before i left did i see grog in his hat  matt oh it was amazing  ashley grog you look so distinguished  travis go on  ashley you look so great in that hat where did you get this hat  travis apparently this is the official tour hat of the house of whitestone  laura its the truth  travis and apparently im the first  laura yep it was 
none	 made hundreds of years ago and was just sitting on the shelf waiting for the  first official tour guide  travis how its not covered in dust or decay i have no idea  ashley oh grog this is just the perfect job for you  travis does it fit well i feel like its a bit small  ashley you know what its just supposed to be a little jaunty like that i think  travis oh its got a little swagger  ashley yeah just a little its great  taliesin makes you look bigger as well 
none	  ashley yes  travis yeah i am pretty tiny these days i have not been lifting  marisha is he wearing like a lolita hat is that whats going on  travis like a maid cafe  matt kind of a very oversized one its widebrimmed and floppy and its got all these  ribbons cascading  travis i like the derby analogy thats what i was going for  marisha derby week is this weekend i think  matt timely there you go grog  marisha you look like an old southern white woman  travis all i 
none	 aim for in life  matt so vex pike keyleth taryon what are you guys doing  laura were heading to the sun tree  matt all right you make your way to the sun tree its about ten in the morning timewise by  the time you get going and you see them kind of gliding around the outskirts of the castle doing  their slow traveling tour as you approach the sun tree where are you going heading to westruun  ashley lets go see him  marisha do you know of a tree thats close by his 
none	 house that we can just be right there  ashley yeah i mean in the backyard we have a pretty large tree  marisha can i get us to that tree  matt youve seen it before youve been to the house youve stayed there so you know the tree  she mentions yeah  marisha okay that tree psew  matt all right as you guys step through the portal created on the outskirts of the sun tree  you step through into i wouldnt say its a yard its not a big yard its more of a small 
none	  what would be used as a storage space behind this building but you have the twostory red brick  building that is your and for a while grogs home of upbringing wilhand is not in the  backyard however you do see that there is a lot of leftover building materials from the  reconstruction of the second story which sustained damage from the original assault of the  conclave but looking up at the roof which last you saw was amid disarray looks like its been  reconstructed and completed and the home is once again whole  
none	 ashley well this is nice to see its put together again well shall we  laura find out about that curse  ashley exhales okay  matt you knock on the door theres a slight pause a little voice inside goes  eh who is it  ashley oh wilhand its pike  matt in the yard  ashley yeah yeah we i just went around  laughter  ashley just went around  marisha the gate was open the side gate  ashley the gate was open  sam the dog run  ashley and the dog run just 
none	 went around the dog run  marisha no the back door the back door  matt another moment passes before the back door opens which leads into the small kitchen its a  humble home but as it opens up wilhand is there looking as liverspotted and grinning as he was  last you saw him his balding top of his head and the crazed white mane of hair behind has gotten  even longer and unkempt as hes now on his own and doesnt have anyone to really groom him so hes  going a little wildgnome right now 
none	 you see his face light up immediately as soon as he sees your  expression oh pike pike its so good  ashley oh oh oh im sorry im very strong  matt i noticed well friends  laura good to see you again  matt dexavlia  laura thats right  matt and thats keyfen  marisha got it  matt and  sam taryon darrington in gnome i say its a pleasure to make your ataintance  laughter  matt his eyes go wide ah i almost heard that well come in come in he turns around and

none	  kitchen frantically trying to make tea hes like i wasnt expecting guests my apologies  hold on hes like one hand hes filling this tea kettle and the other hands trying to find  some flint and hes like  marisha i light it up with my flame hands  matt i did it  laughter  matt sets it down okay he goes and sets the kettle onto the flame dont touch it burns  anyway im so glad you could make it its so good to see you pike  ashley its so good to see you

none	 mean to you  matt no no not mean at all just extremely forceful  laughter  ashley well we came well first i wanted you to meet taryon our new friend  matt oh whats your name  sam taryon darrington  matt taryon pleasure to meet you  sam yes its a pleasure to make your acuntance acuntance  laura wow wow  matt he leans over and goes youre making interesting friends these days pike  ashley well okay im just gonna  matt sarenrae was very specific about making sure that you avoid the bad folk 
tavern	 and youre  currently dealing with what looks to be some ruffians using some naughty language  marisha is penis a bad word  laura just dont say that word again keyleth i mean its not  ashley you know i just feel like i like to be surrounded by all types to sort of you know get  to know  matt laughs just messing with you  ashley oh i thought you got  matt what you think i didnt get drunk and say the off thing here and there back in my day i  was a 
town	 bit of a rabblerouser whether you believe it or not mmhm  ashley you were  laughter  ashley well i might as well just come out with it im stalling so we had some visitors in  whitestone where were staying right now im just really nervous  it was johann and ogden and jb  matt hm  ashley they came to visit cause i had sent them a little money and a letter  matt well thats very kind of you  ashley and they came to town to stay and to just see the town and 
none	 they told me something a little  disturbing ogden said hes been having visions and dreams about something about a blood curse  does this sound familiar to you at all  matt to be perfectly upfront i kind of escaped the trickfoot lifestyle when i was maybe about  your age so im not as keen on all the familial history but i can say that theres been more than  one curse thrown at our family name  ashley this is true  matt i dont know i havent spoken with them in quite some time or really 
none	 anybody else i decided  that you there was something special about you and it wasnt right to have you grow up in such an  uncouth environment so i wanted to provide something different for you i dont know if i  succeeded but i did my best and brought you into the light of the one that saved me and look at  you now and he leans forward and grabs your holy symbol from the front and goes why youre the  brightest star she has  laura im gonna be terrible can i insight check him 
none	 i just want to see if it looks like hes  hiding anything  matt make an insight check  laura highpitched im sorry wilhand  ashley its okay  sam hes an old man he doesnt lie  laura 14  matt 14 hes hard to read in the sense that hes lived long enough and seen enough things in his  time that hes open but he keeps his history guarded by nature he seems genuine but at the  same time youre not getting the whole picture because hes not revealing the whole picture he  also 
none	 spends a lot of time alone too so by nature hes a little hermited so thats as much as you  can make out  laura wilhand how old were you when you left the trickfoot family  matt oh i wouldve been maybe in my early 40s  laura oh whispers how old are you  ashley early 40s  laura okay okay so he was around for a while okay did you know theobold  matt yes  laura and so do you know what happened to him  matt in what way  laura well ogden said 
none	 he was affected by the curse that he was killed by it  matt i wasnt around for that  marisha insight check  matt make an insight check  marisha 24 no hang on wait wait wait i keep forgetting my insight went up  sam well it seems to have worked  marisha 26  liam oh he turned around  laughter  sam whispers we have nothing to sell  laura yes we do we have these shirts that are still in the store  sam oh those shirts there  travis been out for a week 
none	  ashley you can even fold up the sleeves to make them super fashionable  laura theyre super cool  liam and soft like the hoodie  travis show em the dice on the back  laura squeaky theres a critical role logo on the back  laughter  travis thats the house voice when we go home its all that  sam really thats how she talks at home oh boy  travis yeah thats what we call the bailey switch got home and it was like fuck  matt im sorry i just i dont deal with them 
none	 much these days they wander they im just an  old gnome trying to live his twilight years in peace and the joy of the everlight  ashley so i dont mean to press you on this wilhand but did you know how he died i mean  even if you werent there did you hear about it  matt i know that he had passed and i heard it was around mysterious circumstances but like many  trickfoots before me and many after they tend to die under mysterious circumstances its kind of  the life they lead  
none	 marisha wilhand if you dont mind me asking  matt there we are yes  marisha i know you mentioned to pike before about a blood curse do you actually believe in the  curse or do you believe that its because of the life the trickfoots lead i know youve worked  hard to get away from them  matt i dont know i havent delved too deep into the history of the family thats more  ogdens fare i just wanted to leave it all behind me for the most part i dont even tell people  im 
town	 a trickfoot they just know me as old wilhand dont want to live under the stigma sorry i wish  i could be of more help  ashley im struggling a bit  matt what bothers you child  ashley i feel like youve told me so much about the family and when they came to town i feel i  almost feel bad about the way that i treated them and i feel like theyre just if anything theyre  just odd im odd and youre odd and thats just the way trickfoots are  matt thats the way 
none	 family is those closest to you are usually the most odd  laura its very true  matt thereve been very upstanding people in our family in the past and thereve been some  downright scoundrels were as varied as any other folk in exandria it just so happens that some of  the scoundrels had a higher profile in the past and set us on a path of expectation besides for  gnomes outside of kraghammer its hard to make a living outside of farming or courier services and  other menial tasks tinkering seems to be already a 
none	 very cluttered business so how else are they  going to make their means i suppose than pilfering here and there i dont blame them for  that i just dont want to live it and didnt wish for you to live it either  ashley well i thank you for that i couldnt imagine my life any different  matt i just hope it was enough you and the mountain man  ashley well hes my protector for sure  matt good i was hoping he would be he was my protector at one time as well  laura 
none	 it might be a small comfort to know that pikes doing a wonderful job of changing the  trickfoot name  matt really  laura shes a hero of the land trickfoot is known as hero now  matt hero what did you do  ashley well i mean i didnt do it we all did but we killed lots of dragons and you know  weve done some pretty cool things  laura shes saved a lot of people  marisha plus she singlehandedly helped lead the rebuilding of a sarenrae temple in vasselheim  matt way over in 
none	 vasselheim  ashley ive traveled very far  matt youve made the lady of the everlight very proud of you then laughs  sam she also owns a bakery coowns a bakery with the rest of us and she is one of the finest  bakers we have  laura its true its true  matt where did you learn to bake  ashley it just i think laughs i dont know i think over you know this past year  laughter  ashley we would drink a lot and we would just be in the kitchen sometimes without anything 
none	 to do  us girls and taryon just throwing some shit in a bowl and seeing what we could make  sam the best bakers make it up as they go  matt youre all very lucky  laura its not a very precise sort of thing its funny mix things together  and then it just turns out  sam we dont even have measuring cups we just kinda pour it all in and shake it up and see what  comes out  matt that sounds amazing  ashley here here i have its only half cause i 
none	 ate half of it in our journey through the tree  laughter  sam it literally took five minutes to get here  ashley but its half of a blondie that was made yesterday  matt did you make this  ashley well no i mean he was making them but its our recipe  sam i made it off of a recipe that she had cultivated and its quite youll taste  ashley i go and get some tea make the rest of the tea for everybody  matt oh the tea  ashley i got it i got 
none	 it sit sit enjoy here here  laura oh thank you  matt its a bit stale mm  laura imagine if it was fresh  matt youre a very good cleric  ashley you know i know thank you for your honesty theyre great when theyre fresh  matt ill finish this later  ashley ill bring you a profiterolo cause that you will love  matt ive gotta cut down you know the diabetes  laughter  matt but thank you i greatly appreciate the offer a bakery wow  travis the old gnome diabetes  ashley i 
none	 could maybe try and heal you of that well just one more thing so ogden in his  visions that hes been having and he told this to vex that he saw visions of me dying basically  by a shadowy  laura shadowy being with eyes like burning coal  matt well youd best be avoiding anything with eyes like coals  laura right  matt dreams are dreams visions are different now was it a dream he had or was it a vision  laura its a recurring dream very constant and it has him very worried  
dung	 if hes telling the truth  matt do you know if ogden has found faith  ashley i didnt ask him  matt well i cant say some given the calling they dont know why that is given id like to  think that even the most dastardly of characters can be redeemed my memory of their family is a  dark one but who am i to judge as i have not engaged with their path for hundreds of years now  maybe you should ask him  ashley okay  marisha why do you think ogden is dastardly 
none	 what did he do  matt i dont know him that well i left before we got to become friends  marisha just going off what you said  matt just meaning the trickfoots in general  ashley so would it be laughs would it be different if he had these dreams or visions if he  was a follower of sarenrae or has found faith of some sort  matt well those are the only visions ive received and theyve kept you safe this long  yes its the only life i know i cant speak for him but 
none	 that would put me at ease but i also  dont understand all this he glances over at taryons dragonhide armor and the giant metallic  man behind him with glowing runes on his body thats writing this all down and goes you know  them arcane stuff  ashley its you know to each his own  laughter  matt tea  laura sure  matt all right you guys stay for a bit and have some tea with him and catch up and let him know  more of the adventures that youve had since last you checked 
none	 up on him in westruun anything else  you guys want to work out here in westruun with wilhand  sam ill just ask him is there any message you wish to send to ogden or the rest of the  trickfoots  matt i would tell them that if they have a penchant for sweets they should curb that a bit  apparently theres a family history of diabetes  laughter  sam all right  matt just a word of advice im throwing out there for their own wellbeing  sam okay family history got it  matt 
none	 yeah  sam all right  matt and dont be penises  sam very good  marisha wise words  matt see told you laughs  laura wilhand should you remember anything about this curse that weve asked you about please send  word we want to protect pike as much as we can  matt i understand ill look into some books if i hear anything ill send word  laura thank you  matt of course  ashley im sure its nothing but in case you remember anything  matt i will be happy to do so

none	 anyone of any sort of gnomish nobility for a while thats my  recommendation he says to you in gnome  ashley were working on it  laughter  marisha pike is there anything you need from here before we leave  ashley i dont think so real quick  matt yes  ashley i get up and i stand behind him and comb his hair out  matt its been a while since somebodys done that for me thank you  ashley it looks so great just all natural out ready for the world but i wanted to make 
none	 you just  look a little bit more coiffed  matt thank you its a bit unbridled i would like perhaps to the word escapes me and he  takes another sip of his tea thinks for a second goes i wish to be less crazylooking  ashley well can i just say i think you look perfect  matt and he reaches up and pinches the edge of your cheek and goes well can i just say that i  never thought blue would be your color but it looks fantastic  ashley it hasnt washed out yet but 
none	 its fun for a little bit just to try something  matt just to try something ah i remember those days anyway dont be a stranger  ashley okay it was wonderful to see you  matt wonderful to see you as well and please do send me some fresher treats  laura i will  matt thank you  laura thank you for your hospitality  matt of course thank you for coming and a pleasure to meet you uh  sam taryon darrington  matt taryon darrington pleasure to meet you yes  sam not a firm handshake 
none	 at all  ashley okay  matt all right you guys make your way back to whitestone  ashley whats that  matt you guys make your way back to whitestone  laura i guess so yeah  ashley shoot  matt you guys return  ashley finish the rest of the blondie through the fshoom  matt just chomps as you step through  taliesin stale blondie  marisha stale blondie  matt as you guys return stepping back into the main thoroughfare of whitestone you gather over  this time the rest of your friends have done a 
none	 relatively decent theyre like three quarters of  the way through their tour of whitestone its very basic theyre not going through every single  detail but theyre going in various sections and ogden has been asleep pretty much the entire time  jb johann and astra have been eager for the most part asking questions and some of the time  when youre not looking kind of flicking the back of the hat but youve come around now youre  heading back up north after coming from the graveyard and both the pelor church and the raven  queen 
tavern	 shrine that have been built there and youve made your way back northward into the city  proper  liam we said we were gonna do firecracker alley see the musketeers can we do that i really want  to do that  taliesin im not allowed to say that word out loud  liam well ill hush up around your sister but its just us right now  travis yeah either that or its like a pub crawl through whitestone one or the other  taliesin i think they may be drunk enough lets go see the  matt 
none	 okay is there any specific individual that youve set as the captain of the riflemen of  whitestone  taliesin your boy whats his name  liam kynan  taliesin yeah  marisha gasps what  matt all right so as you guys approach making your way towards the northern barracks of the  city you hear a cluster of small controlled explosions at which point the gnomes all kind of  shudder for a second in that moment ogden goes incoherent yelling were under attack  travis its all right its all right its all part of the tour 
none	 no its all right oh man its  okay this is firecracker alley  matt okay  travis all right  matt all right  travis these my people  matt jb wipes the drool from his mouth as you guys approach you see theres a line of ten men  and women in armor with rifles theyre currently in the process of reloading them and there you  see at the edge is a leatherclad kynan who is in the process of instructing loudly the reloading  process the use of black powder and the preparation for the rifles 
none	 for a secondary shot  as they all prepare he goes all right and aim arm up in the air they all clatter up in  front fire gunshot they all go off again these big plumes of smoke shoot out from the  front you watch as across the way there are a dozen or so hay targets with what looks like cloth  and some figures drawn on them that have a number of holes blown through them in multiple places  the shots dont have extremely good aim  liam how many rifles are we looking at 
none	 here  matt youre looking at ten different people with rifles  liam queens grace thats a lot of guns percy  matt as you guys approach gently as theyre preparing for the next shot you see kynan bring  up his arm and look over and see the rest of you and immediately changes his posture he was  already in a formal leader position but as soon as you approach its almost like oh the boss is  here to watch and he kind of inhales hold we have company  taliesin at ease at ease  matt 
none	 turns around and jogs up to the edge of the perimeter of this training ground and he goes  hello by what pleasure do we have you  taliesin we are giving a very rare tour of the grounds and we thought that these being  trickfoots as in the family of trickfoots  matt oh oh  taliesin  we would show them one of the things that makes this castle so special and one of the  things that makes this castle so special is you and your company  matt well it is an honor to have 
none	 the trickfoots among us i am captain kynan leore i am the as  to recently assigned captain of the riflemen of whitestone and you see him go from his whole  structured presentation begins to quickly fade as the nerves kick in you can see his voice get a  little quivery and his posture begin to fall a little bit these are my riflemen and women its  called riflemen but its men and women its a formality  liam kynan  matt it can be changed it can be changed  liam hey  laura riflepeople  
none	 liam hey its been months youre looking on point  matt well were trying theyre very very good people arent they yes and they all dont know  how to answer and look at each other and look at him and  taliesin at ease this man in command of you all is one of the few people who could actually do a  little damage to us in our time he has great respect  liam yeah  matt he puts his eyes down slightly sheepishly and guiltily as you say that but  liam thats old history how 
none	 are you getting on  matt very well very well i mean very few get a second chance  i just dont want to mess this up  liam are you being of use  matt looks to percival  taliesin very much so i could not think of anyone better for this particular occupation i am  nothing but prideful  liam well thats enough  matt then yes i have been of use  liam whispers hows simon  matt oh he looks over at the rest of the folk and goes at ease go get some food 
none	 the men  break and make their way walking out  laura and women because theres men and women  liam sometimes i sound like my sister im sorry i just like equality for all  matt but he leans in and says simon is doing well and he pulls up the front of his armor a  little bit and you can see the snake belt itself is still on him  liam whispers can i say hello  matt i mean glances over at the men not watching and women  taliesin im showing off some trick shots 
none	 to the trickfoots while were  matt okay so as youre doing a whole buffalo bill  laughter  matt i should say wild bill buffalo bill is a whole different thing buffalo bills a very  different thing  laughter  matt i need to specify  taliesin thats a very different show  matt yeah no its a whole different pit in whitestone to go to he goes ahead and does a  little whistle and suddenly the belt turns into a snake and winds its way up the forearm and  hisses  liam oh fuck buddy 
none	 can i hold him for a minute  matt yeah well hes still yours  liam ah  matt the snake leaps to your arm and coils around  liam hey hey you are bigger what is he feeding you what are you feeding him  laura belt  matt well nothing its a  liam well i fed him i mean you dont have to i guess  matt i can i can feed him i just didnt think its a belt i dont know  ill feed him  liam when was the last time this belt was 
none	 a snake before now  matt when you give it to me i havent had to use it and then should i let it out i dont  know i dont know how these things work okay  marisha not everyone can be a dope adventurer all right  liam im conflicted here i did give this to you  matt right you gave me a belt and ive used it and its been great  liam can i insight check simon to see how hes feeling  matt sure with your extensive knowledge of magical snake belts  lets 
none	 see how well this goes  liam hey this is all bullshit man  matt i know i love it  liam thats insight  matt yeah  liam no im gonna use wisdom excuse me im going to use luck oh thats much better  travis luck  matt blow that luck baby  liam thats 18  matt 18 yeah he seems fine as a magical snake it can transform back and forth it doesnt appear  to require food or water when its in its belt form it wouldnt necessarily be conscious of the  time in 
none	 between so as far as simons concerned its been a very short period of time  liam kynan  matt yes vax  liam you are happy here happier here  matt very  liam im very glad for that you seem happy and everybody deserves a second chance and i guess  what im asking is can i have my snake back  matt of course yes here i mean he was i was just borrowing it for a while  liam okay i feel silly i mean i gave it to you a year ago or so but 
none	 i dont know i missed him  i think i missed him  matt okay yeah  taliesin im so glad i cant hear any of this  matt as he looks over at percy doing all these trick shots in the air and throwing things up and  like showing the spinning and the gnomes are like whoa whoa whoa  travis as you can see firecracker alley was constructed after the revolt of the haybales of  1874 39  liam i let simon crawl down and form a belt  matt okay  liam and i give 
none	 kynan just a gentle little clap on the cheek and say im glad youre fitting in  matt me too and thank you sorry about not feeding your snake i didnt  laughter  liam i think youre well on your way to being that hero you dreamed of when you were younger  matt well thank you i was  gun noise and his rifle goes off like in the ground  next to him  laura oh my god  matt a big plume of dirt next to him and he goes uh  liam happens to the 
none	 best of us you got all your toes  matt men and he goes running off toward the rest of his riflemen  yeah you shook him a little bit  liam all right  travis so how do you feel your tour has gone so far are you feeling educated enthused  matt all of that all of it honestly johann at this point is still enthralled and goes where  does one procure such a weapon  taliesin one does not sadly  matt okay  taliesin theyre very rare outside of this castle and traditionally when theyre 
none	 found  outside of this castle theyre collected and the owner is often killed  matt good to know good to know astra and astra goes what i think its sexy and  johanns like if you have one lying around you dont need just let me   taliesin i will let you know  matt okay  travis hey percy i feel like we should end with like a big bang like you know like the goods  of whitestone  sam the old appleinthehand  liam whispers do you think grog and i could shoot a gun 
none	  taliesin yes i think thats a great idea  liam yeah grog were gonna shoot guns  travis really  liam yeah  liam he just said he gave permission  taliesin i will say yes to this not one of my guns but thankfully we have a couple of the ones  that are a little wonky  matt the standard rifles you do have those yeah  liam but i like i dont know i throw things can you show me how it works  taliesin kind of yes  liam all right  taliesin itll be 
none	 fun  liam shouts gun please  matt eventually you guys are outfitted with two rifles theyre not loaded yet you can show them  how to load it  taliesin im showing them through the basics of loading the powder i do this very quickly so i  know its very difficult to see  liam youre fast  taliesin very fast yes i load it for them  matt all right you load it for each of them  taliesin one at a time  matt okay  taliesin because this could go poorly  travis were not 
none	 loading it ourselves  taliesin youre welcome to try  travis i am a selfmade man i would like to try  liam i will let percy load my gun  matt okay so percy loads your gun grog make an intelligence check  taliesin i give him an ample amount of powder  travis thats gonna be negative something  laughter  travis 12  matt okay all right you give him an ample amount of powder and he uses it he uses it the  right way its a lot of it but i mean overall he got 
none	 the gist of it and hes laughs  taliesin this is going to be funny  matt yeah both rifles locked in the iron balls properly packed into the rifle you both take aim  i would like you both to roll an attack roll using your dexterity modifier youre not proficient so  its just a d20 plus your dexterity modifier grog you have disadvantage on this one  travis not going to need it  liam plus dex modifier  travis seven  matt what did you roll  travis five plus two  matt okay so it 
none	 wasnt a misfire at the very least  liam 17  matt okay you pull it up vax aim and gunshot you watch as the top of one of the hay  targets explodes off you managed to make a hit its a little off but you managed to at least  make contact  taliesin very solid  laura did his feet come off the ground  matt no but it does come up and you have to catch yourself  taliesin theres a bit of kick to these you feel it in the shoulder  laura so there 
none	  matt grog does not move at all when it fires explosion noise when you do fire nothing  reacts none of the hay reacts and theres a pause and about 300 feet back you watch as a  small tree goes cracking heavy impact  travis was that the sun tree  taliesin maybe  travis im so sorry  taliesin its all right  travis i could go stick it up and cover it with tape and stuff  taliesin i think thats a great idea  travis okay i take off running  laughter  liam vax 
none	 who was really giddy a minute ago takes the rifle and hands it to you  these are dangerous  taliesin extremely  liam there shouldnt be too many of these  taliesin there should not which is why if we find them outside this castle its taken care of  one way or another  liam fuck  taliesin im going to do a quick load shot just to air it out a bit  matt okay you do and its a really rapid reload were talking schwarzenegger t2 spin the  shotgun onehanded gunshot  travis im a 
none	 hundred yards away shouldnt he have to roll to see if he shoots me  matt are you shooting at grog  taliesin no  laughter  taliesin the rifle doesnt have a super long range either its more of a stopping power  weapon  matt go ahead and roll with proficiency and your dex modiifer  liam you dont shoot with your gun you shoot with your heart  taliesin yeah this is 25  matt the same target vax the impact of the head you hit you watch as the entire upper part of its  torso 
none	 and head explosion noise explode into a spray of slightly seared and  slightly burning hay  taliesin i will never ever outlive the shame i feel for inventing these i put it back down walk  away  travis from 300 yards away i yell muffled it is not the sun tree  laughter  matt as he runs back you can see as johanns like  is there any chance that we could shoot one  taliesin you know what im going to say yes  travis yeah  matt you see astras squeals  taliesin one at 
none	 a time  matt they both look at each other and they both jump off the carpet  taliesin youll have to be very careful its very dangerous  not just for what youre shooting at  matt theyre not even listening theyre both picking up the two rifles  taliesin theyre both empty  matt they pick them up and are looking at it and holding it upward and aiming it sideways they  dont really know how to do it  taliesin im going to go a little luciferian here  liam im back in security guard mode 
none	  matt do you help them load it  taliesin im going to load one at a time im going to misload im going to let the powder  roll so it creates a flashpan its going to be a big ugly loud mess its not going to fire a  shot its just going to be a big ugly mess  marisha youre making a blank  taliesin im making a blank im making a blank with a powder pop its going to be a little  singey  matt all right so for the purposes of this okay 
none	 no terrible misfire the first shot is  johann because he pushes astra back and is like let the men do this first takes the rifle from  you picks it up and aims it at a weird angle and i just pull right here on the thing right  over here explosion before he finishes it goes off it goes flying from his hand and he  stands there for a second with his hands open and as he turns back towards you you can see theres  a little bit of singe on his eyebrows the burst of 
none	 the smoke and the flash seared the front of his  face ever so slightly he turns to you and goes that was amazing did i hit it  taliesin you hit something well done  matt i hit it youre up lady astras like oh and she runs up takes the gun same thing  taliesin you know just because im curious im going to give her a normal shot  matt okay so you load it properly she takes it and aims at one of the other targets gunshot  she manages to hold onto it this one 
none	 doesnt blast out of her hand you dont see any point of  impact  taliesin good form  matt shes like ow and she releases her hand because of the heat of the barrel  taliesin that as well  matt she puts it on the ground and goes that was fun im good  taliesin i figured  travis panting i heard shots whats the problem  matt grog you look down and notice that theres a little bit of bleeding from your knee and  theres a small bullet hole that you didnt notice as you were 
dung	 running back  taliesin the sun tree was angry it may have taken revenge  travis whines groans  matt it only went in an inch it wasnt that hard of an impact  travis mine  laughter  matt eventually as you guys are heading back now after the rest of your tour you meet up with  the rest of the party as you guys finish the tour  liam a minor thing as were walking back i sidle up next to percy and i dont say anything i  just do that friend thing where you just 
town	 go and i keep walking  matt vax bumps you  travis do we want to show them the sphere  taliesin no i think that weve had enough for the evening  travis really thats the craziest thing in this town  taliesin no i have to fill out so much paperwork for that one well do it next time  travis oh you know i do know how to write a few letters now  taliesin if you would like to try and fill out the paperwork  travis well lets not get carried away  taliesin all 
none	 right then i certainly am not up to it so i completely understand if youre not  travis fine  matt all right you guys catch up with the rest of the party and you all make your way to the  castle at about the same time  taliesin just checking none of the gnomes had even the slightest tinge of reaction when he said  that or no  matt make a perception check  liam other than when i was shooting the gun ive been watching them like a hawk as well  taliesin 23  matt 
none	 okay vax  liam 29  matt okay  taliesin even a twitch  matt no reaction no twitch they have no idea what you were talking about and they have not  stolen anything youve been keeping a close eye  sam except your heart  travis aint that the truth  matt as you guys all reconvene for a midafternoon lunch at the castle everyones made  their way in the meals been placed less pastryheavy than the breakfast that johann  originally ordered but there are meats and breads and its actually pretty hearty for a  
none	 midday lunch and they keep bringing more in you get the sense that the trickfoots dont eat like  royals often and theyre definitely making the best they can of the situation you see jb eating  her meal and helping ogden as you guys settle in what do you want to do  laura what the fuck should we do  taliesin perhaps its time to have a difficult conversation  ashley i think so id like to talk to ogden again  matt okay hes currently at the table and hes tracing his finger on the side while 
none	  occasionally jb goes uncle and taps him  oh right she goes and takes a piece of bread and soaks it in the soup for a second and puts it  in his mouth he chews on it for a bit and as you walk over he pushes jbs hand out of the way and  goes oh young pike hello  ashley hello did you have a good time today  matt i did i havent had a rest like that in a long time  ashley well thats good  matt your city gets very loud  
none	 ashley it gets pretty loud here its true i take it you went to firecracker alley  matt thats the one  ashley yeah its real loud  matt jb peeks over ogdens shoulder listening in it was quite nice actually we got to watch  them fire these  anyway ogden pushes in not even paying attention to her its so good to see you  ashley will you take a walk with me  matt but of course he takes his stick and stands up  jbs like oh where would you like to go  ashley well 
none	 i just would love to spend some time with you alone uncle ogden  matt jb you watch her face go  ashley ill spend some time with you as well jb i just want to make sure i get time with  everybody  matt of course enjoy ill just and she goes back to her meal and begins cutting it up with  fervor or frustration  laura can i take jb and ask her did you happen to see my home on the tour  matt i dont know where you live  laura would you like 
none	 to see id love to show you  matt she sidelong glances at pike helping ogden up as they begin to make their way out you know  what yes i would love that  laura all right i take her  matt so you guys begin making your way while they exit because ogdens a little slower you  and ogden eventually make your way out to the front part of the castle walking along the side  grounds hes with his cane walking what did you wish to discuss young pike  ashley im blanking right now is 
none	 there a temple of sarenrae here  matt you have definitely had one constructed its a smaller scale the larger temples here are  for pelor and such and youve been away most of your focus has been in vasselheim and emon so you  havent done the full temple construct here but theres a small shrine that youve built so at  least you can go there  ashley i would love to walk you to something that i was a part of building and creating here in the  city if youd like  matt of course lead 
none	 the way i am your guest i am here at your behest  ashley i walk him to the shrine of sarenrae  matt okay there was a big building that collapsed during the briarwood period the lot was  cleaned out and its a small standing shrine to sarenrae at the time being to eventually be the  placeholder for the full temples construction that youll build around it but for the time  being essentially a few small benches set in a circular stone fashion and theres a fountainlike  carving a simple carving of sarenrae for people 
none	 to pray to you eventually walk him to that  centerpiece its mostly empty this time of day nobodys currently in the process of upkeep there  isnt a need for it some fallen leaves and its a little dirty on some of the benches but you  brush it off and you both sit on the bench looking up at the big winged statue of her he  sits down  ashley do you know where we are  matt no idea  ashley this is a shrine of sarenrae who i follow and i wanted to bring you 
none	 here because i  wanted to share it with you  matt thank you its very peaceful  ashley sighs how are you feeling  matt after looking around for a minute he leans into you and goes pike we need to talk ive  been tying together the missing pieces of our history for most of my life this information has  helped me once before and as im sure has been discussed at length with your friends there is a  curse upon this bloodline my research has brought me some knowledge and ive been able to cast 
none	 this  curse out of one trickfoot before but i failed once before that and i miss her to this day do  you want to know the history of our curse  ashley i would  matt over four centuries ago when our kin still occupied the city of witterbach up in the  cliffkeep mountains long before our bloodline took the name trickfoot there was a wily rock  gnome called og pipemender now og grew jealous of his brother lons and his businesss success  and his marriage apparently so seeking a means of balancing their standing 
none	 bringing lons down a  peg or two og plotted to undermine and shame his brother and destroy his life now he was  successful in this plot at least from what ive gleaned lons was ruined but not before it was  revealed to lons that og himself was the culprit now cornered and fearing for his life og lashed  out and slew his brother he fled witterbach and wandered the mountains for weeks scavenging to  survive on a full moon he was visited by a vision of what is believed to be the lawbearer  erathis 
none	 herself at least an aspect of her at the very least now this grave injustice he had  committed did not go unnoticed by the lawbearer and it required punishment and a curse was set  within the very blood of og himself one that lay dormant from generation to generation unless  those carrying the seed fell to extreme selfishness and wanton destruction of others now  we trickfoots may not have the best reputation but what we do we do it to survive and we hurt  no other in the process those that wander too far into 
dung	 the dark call up this curse and the shades  within them slowly hollow them out leaving a ravenous selfish beast of a gnome these visions  that ive dreamt ive had them before they were not wrong i saw the shades within my beloved  ishma but knew too little at the time to stop them i caught the shades within others since  within johann here even years and years ago and used what i learned to exorcise them out now  these visions i have now show you young pike a darkness within you far greater than 
none	 the others  and i dont know what has drawn them to you you walk with such light and i am worried what could  be hidden beneath all the layers of silver and gold and blue and sarenraes blessing that could  still draw these shades to you where youve been what youve done i know not i know not the  justice of the goddess can presume not to know i dont bother myself with such unknowable things  but i am here to try and help if i can if youll have me  ashley wow thats 
none	 a lot  matt ive had an entire lifetime to think and learn and research and regret  ashley how long have you been having visions in terms of this happening with me  matt this is only over the past couple of years but i knew not where to find you until you sent  your letter  ashley and what are your thoughts on jb  matt she is very dedicated shes very sweet shes a bit distracted at times she cares much  for the stories of you and your friends the poor things been at my 
none	 side for the majority of her  youth i feel like a burden she looks after me and not much else so she lives vicariously  through the stories she manages to assemble of you  ashley and she knows about all this as well  matt they all know weve had time to speak i was the one that insisted we come see you and i  do apologize for the rest of them they are unique  ashley well i think i was at first shocked and i feel like i need to apologize for my trepidation  
none	 and wariness at first  matt its understood like i said we have a reputation one that youve as far as what ive  heard been able to kick to the curb  laura sneezes  ashley bless you  laura thank you  ashley just little fairies sneezing fairies around here  matt its adorable i dont see them  ashley you usually dont you just hear them  matt i dont see much anyway  ashley its okay you said youve had some successes in releasing this thing  matt ive cast it out once before ive been 
none	 trying to define a ritual that can do so  ashley how do you define this ritual is this under any sort of faith that you have  matt i find little in faith however the exorcism is based in divine magics and some bits  of information ive gleaned from the age of arcanum long ago back when possession was a  common thing and gods still walked the earth what ive found and he leans forward on his stick   is to perform this pardon me its the breakfast all the oatmeal  its good for the 
none	 fiber  ashley it sure is  matt what i would require would be the highest point on the highest mountain in the vicinity as  high up as we can go like somewhere in those mountains there he points a broad stroke to the  north northeast to the alabaster sierras that surround the parchwood and when the moon is  full as that was when the original curse was cast upon us there we hallow the ground to prepare  perhaps you or another individual of a clerical background could do so and it does take some time 
none	  to hallow it but with the ground hallowed and the moon is full i can perform the exorcism now  should the shades be strong enough to survive the exorcism as they have once before it will be up  to you and your friends to slay them while theyre bound on that land and if you cast them to the  shadows where they came the blood curse on you would be no more  ashley but theyll come back again  matt they are passed on through the bloodline  ashley is there any way to get 
none	 rid of them forever  matt from an individual yes overall i know not that involves silly crazy god stuff and  well they havent been around often there are a few things we need to prepare for the exorcism  that i dont have the access of if you wish to go through with this let me know if you find this  all mumbo jumbo and you dont believe me i dont blame you either and we can be on our way  choice is yours  ashley so you want to perform the exorcism on me  
none	 matt youre the one the visions brought me to  ashley well this is something that ill have to think about well have to talk about it with  everybody else especially if it involves them as well  matt of course take your time theyre about jb jb how close are we to the full moon hes  shouting out into nothing  marisha can i do a nature check  matt youre not there  ashley do i know  matt make a nature check  ashley nature check  matt nature check  ashley okay  travis 
none	 get it  ashley let me find a d20 oh ten  matt youre not sure youre not very involved or invested in the cycles of the moon  ashley you know i could talk to keyleth about that she would know  matt very well  ashley and thank you for telling me all of this  matt thank you for being so kind to family that you owe nothing to  ashley im very grateful that youre here and even though our last name has a reputation im  proud to be a trickfoot  matt that warms 
none	 my heart and to hear you say that maybe one day i will be as well before my  time is up  ashley i think we can make that happen  matt i think so too he reaches out and pinches the air about a foot off of your face  there it is  ashley well lets go back i have some thinking to do  matt all right your gray blob is very nice  ashley oh yes she is  matt thank you for showing me if you dont mind  ashley oh of course

none	  laura well yes i know i know that but my experience with trickfoots has always been  pleasant  matt lets just say that some of our family arent the most subtle she looks down and to the  side and averts her gaze theyre good people theyre very good people johann has done a lot  for us but hes more prideful than the rest of us as soon as anyone starts any shit hes the  first to get in their face about it hes a fiery one its why astra took to him  laura shes 
none	 fiery as well it seems  matt shes something  laura if you could settle down anywhere where would it be  matt she looks around at the whole city probably right here  laura whitestone is quite wonderful  matt its very nice people here are far less dubious than the folks in  kymal at the very least  laura pikes buttered us up quite well  matt i miss her a lot we grew up together i dont know if you knew that  laura i heard how old was she when she left  matt i 
none	 dont know the specifics of it but me and her were both in our first decade  laura what was that like having pike leave and you staying behind  matt we were friends she was my only friend at the time ive always been a reader they tell me  the first of my kind so i didnt take to making new friends very well that and uncle needs  someone to look after him and i didnt really want to drop the ball on that  laura well youre a good person  matt im a person  
none	 laura would you like to see the library  matt you have a library  laura its growing  matt yes please  laura i dont know how big the library is right now  matt laughs in castle whitestone  laura i mean its my particular  matt oh your personal library its not huge  laura im growing it  matt i know but it took a while to construct it and then some books have made their way in its  maybe a third full but as you show her shes like what kind of books do 
none	 you have  laura oh well a lot of books about really terrible gods some good gods oh i have  something about the feywild i remember picking that up would you like to learn about the  feywild  matt yeah ive only heard a few things  laura i go dig through my books and find it  matt she takes her straightened hair to the side and she nervously steps back with it and smiles  with her little gap tooth are you sure  laura of course have you ever learned anything about the curse on 
dung	 your family have you seen that  in books  matt she starts getting a little dark and says not in the books no nobody really writes books  about the trickfoots i know what ogdens talked about and why were here  i think he wants to try and help  laura right have you ever seen anyone be affected by it personally  matt not in my lifetime the last one ogden went to was before our time me and pike it doesnt  happen often the vision at least  laura well thats good  matt i 
none	 dont know if its a coming of age thing or not  laura but youve never had any visions  matt no i wish i did that would be interesting would be different  laura you are quite different thats something to be proud of  matt she takes the book sighs  laura you know one of my very best friends taryon darrington is an incredible writer and i  bet if you told him about the curse hed be willing to write it down  matt really  laura oh yes you would go into complete detail about 
none	 it and he would make it sound very  interesting maybe we could have somebody draw pictures for it  matt stutters okay  laura trickfoots could be legends  matt well you already have one  laura well yes but there are multiple chapters  matt okay well wed have to talk to uncle ogden about that  he knows it better than anybody  laura of course yes well sit down with him but i bet you know quite a few details as well  having taken care of him for so long  matt maybe i dont 
none	 know  laura we should find tary take that with you  matt youre sure  laura yes yes we can talk about it on the way back  matt okay she follows after you as you guys head back to the castle eventually you guys  stumble up to the castle and theres taryon with doty what are you guys in the process of doing  right now  sam hes combing my hair  matt tary  laura tary  sam 33 34 35 oh le girl how are you  laura hi darling so our dear friend 
none	 jb here i told her what a wonderful writer you are  sam well yes unpublished as of yet as we all know  laura its a growing book  sam budding  laura yes and i told her it might be fun if we wrote down a little about the  trickfoots and their curse  sam oh  laura something so other people can learn about them  sam like a short story or something  laura mmhm  sam i mean sure they could write something like that i would maybe even read it someday  laura 
none	 no i want her to tell you about it and you can write it down that way we have all the  details  sam oh  laura you know youre such a wonderful writer dear  sam i am a wonderful writer but you know my story has intrigue and danger and romance  laura theres all those things in the curse darling maybe just write a new book for the time  being just a small other book  sam seems like a bit of a downer just a book about a curse i mean you know how 
none	 its gonna  end someones gonna get cursed  laura doty  sam what oh oh yes yes of course i would be happy to take down her story yes absolutely if  shell share it with me  laura i mean if shes willing  matt i mean yeah we should get ogden though he knows more than i do about it  laura of course of course you can just tell us a little bit about it while we go get him  sam we could call it an outline and then ogden can fill in the details 
dung	 later  laura of course flourish  matt okay and she goes in to tell you what she knows of the curse in fair detail talking about  how long ago there was people in the family that apparently killed a brother and pissed off a god  and ever since the family was cursed so they left what was once the gnomish city of wittebach  and the curse seems to manifest when a trickfoot falls too deep into the spell of selfishness or  dark thoughts and habits and manifests in these shades that eventually hollow them out 
none	 to the  point where they are nothing but a being of avarice and greed  laura of greed hm  matt well its part of the reason that we have such a bad reputation those that befell the curse  kind of tore a path through the countryside  laura now you say hollowed out by shades do you still look like a normal gnome or  matt i havent seen anyone i dont know this is stuff that i heard from uncle ogden  laura wow i wonder what that looks like  matt hopefully we never find 
none	 out  laura well no obviously but just for detail so we can illustrate it  sam the curse only manifests itself in those who bring it upon themselves with greed or  matt those that draw too close to it thats what i know about it  laura well how can pike be at risk then  sam that seems odd  laura shes one of the most generous people ive ever known  sam unless shes doing things that we dont know about  laura no laughs no its pike  matt i know thats why im worried 
none	  laura yeah  sam well your narrative was crude and the language not at all descriptive but i think we  have the building blocks to work with here for something that we could turn into you know like  an essay an essay of some sort  laura a good short book with a lot of drawings  sam not a book not a book at all nope  laura  leather cover with embossing on it or something quite lovely  sam i dont think it would be thick enough for that  laura gold filigree probably 
none	 something just very beautiful  sam a pamphlet maybe a big pamphlet  matt shes nodding all right yeah  sam well work on it  laura yeah lets head back  matt yeah i should go you join up with pike and ogden you guys reconvene now its getting  later in the day dusk is taking what do you wish to do  laura dont worry i got so many details about the curse i know all about it  ashley oh great i got some details too  laura oh  ashley well i think i would 
none	 love to get everybody together and just talk some stuff out  laura good call should this just be vox machina  ashley yeah just like us  laura okay  travis percy the strings leaving a mark in my chin and cheeks i feel like now is a good time to  put the hat back in its place of holding will you guide me to the hallowed area  from whence it came  taliesin how would you know that its leaving a mark if you had not disturbed the string its  very important  travis it 
none	 itches and i feel deadening of the skin in this ushape  taliesin are you saying that its too difficult for you to wear that its not working  travis nope its staying on  taliesin all right  travis i just wanted to know if you wanted it back  taliesin let me know when you are finished with it and when it is time to retire it i will make  sure that it goes back to its resting place  travis cool will do  laughter  matt all right meal is prepared for the guesting trickfoots 
none	 specified to keep separate from  wherever you decide to have your meal but you manage to gather the rest of vox machina at your  behest to have a discussion i imagine probably in one of your chambers separately from the rest of  the castle where you can talk in private so as you all slowly gather within well say pikes  room for the simplicity of this close the door behind you and you have all been brought  together  marisha you have a really big room pike  ashley yeah it is very large  
none	 marisha yeah not that im comparing im just its very nice  ashley i feel like i dont need this much room  taliesin i think my sister likes you  ashley well we do get along very well  sam youve called us together for a reason  ashley so i talked to and i know you got information too i talked to ogden and he told  me some stuff thats a little disturbing but i guess you know way back in our family there were  these brothers and one of them sort of was overcome with 
none	 jealousy and he killed the other  one and basically long story short our family has had a curse because of that action and ogden  wants to perform an exorcism on me to get rid of this thing but i dont feel any different i  dont feel like i have anything and he said you know we would all have to be a part of it and go  on a mountaintop while theres a full moon and i dont know  laura this seems weird  travis thats heavy  marisha when you list it out like 
town	 that really weird  taliesin bit odd seems a bit odd  sam most times family comes into town you show them a couple sights  marisha you drink a lot of wine  sam  yeah they leave this seems like a strange family visit  liam theres a curse on you  laura yeah jb said it was brought upon by greed  sam and avarice  laura whoa  travis what  liam listen buddy you just learned the letter u to say ushaped i think you should call  that a win  travis i did 
none	  sam jb said that you would have to bring this curse on yourself have you been up to be  straight with us were all on the same team here  laura youre not doing any drugs like scanlan was  ashley no  sam are you sure you dont have greed in your heart lust in your heart  ashley no  travis pike you look me in the eye  ashley no  travis shes telling the truth  laughter  travis not a lie in that little soul of hers  marisha its hard to take 
none	 you seriously ever but even more so now with that ridiculous hat  laura yeah maybe you should take it off its kind of annoying  travis heavy is the head that wears the crown  laughter  liam dont let these people tear you down grog  taliesin at what point will strained the lack of circulation begin to make you talk like this  travis im gonna get you for this  liam and also i mean if we take you at your word and of course we do so the curse you  youre very in tune 
none	 with divine things and with curses and things of fiendish nature you dont  sense anything in yourself it doesnt really add up is it possible i mean theyre family and i  know you love them to a degree but is it possible theyre jerking you around  ashley anythings possible i just i dont feel like theyre lying unless  taliesin i dont feel like theyre telling the whole truth  ashley yeah i dont feel like theyre telling the whole truth but i think somethings  there and i cant seem to get to the bottom of 
none	 it  laura have you prayed to sarenrae  ashley no i havent yet  marisha i feel like were not one to speak on curses and bad things not existing  travis yeah what about a second opinion like one time it was really burning when i was peeing  and the guys like oh eat this and itll be fine and i was like mm im gonna get a second  opinion  marisha that was cranberry juice grog and that was a solid opinion  travis yeah it actually turned out to be true  ashley thats 
none	 a very good analogy  sam what if we do this what if we go up to the mountain full moon go through the motions and  keyleth youre superpowerful you must have some sort of way of telling if this ogden is telling  the truth right  marisha um i could look at his face and his weird tics and deduce very hard  taliesin talk to his tics does he have tics  laura when is the next full moon  matt make a nature check  liam am i remembering that incorrectly  ashley yes  
none	 laura so maybe just try to cure yourself of this curse is that possible  marisha 25  matt 25 four days  taliesin wed have to start right now  sam the other option is and ive been holding onto it cause its valuable i do happen to have  a potion of mind reading so we could go up there with him and i could just read his mind  liam you could also do that now  travis but what if he thinks hes telling the truth  sam that is the smartest thing youve ever said 
none	  travis this fucking hat is magic  laughter  ashley what if how much of that potion do you have  sam one i have one of it  ashley i mean gnomes are small what if we give them all a shot  laura we take the potion and then we read their minds  ashley i understand i think i thought  marisha you thought it was truth serum yeah yeah i was kinda with you there okay hang on i  mean were as taryon said awesome  sam i said that about you  marisha 
none	 i was being generous  sam thank you  marisha if we just go through with this is there any harm in that  taliesin we should start at the very least my worry is if i understand this curse correctly  the only person i think that could possibly be at risk from it would be jb  sam why  taliesin think about it what avarice have any of us ever experienced from pike  ashley i dont even know what that word means  taliesin i  ashley like if you were to just define avarice  
none	 sam you know its sinful in a sort of vague way  ashley i mean i dont even  laura trinket doesnt even know and he knows everything  travis scholars maintain  taliesin what im saying is perhaps  sam google maybe we could google it  taliesin please do actually google avarice  sam i think its having hate in your heart i think  taliesin hate and greed  travis i thought it was pride  marisha hate greed pride any of the seven deadly sins  sam what is avarice  matt its tary  taliesin 
none	 its a covetness its someone is  marisha man i feel like were really getting off the point  taliesin the point im trying to make is and im having a notion  matt my apologies for using a word with a  laura fivedollar word  marisha why did you use an sat word matt why  matt i read a lot of books growing up im sorry  sam doesnt say  liam its pronounced avriggle  taliesin the point im trying to make in all of this is that perhaps theyre trying to save one of  
none	 their own and perhaps they need to move the curse to another trickfoot  sam oh its just greed its just greed  travis like i said greed  laura so wait i have a question what if all of them are actually cursed and theyre trying to  bring you in  travis ooh ooh thats a good thought we kill all of them no  sam yes yes of course theyll be easily killed theyre half our size  laura what did ogden say this exorcism entailed  ashley he said that we go to the highest mountain 
none	 we have to wait til a full moon you  have to have it be hallowed ground and just sort of set up a ritual and he said maybe we could get  help from whomever and i was thinking of vax and i dont know this is so beyond  anything that i know  laura and then what would happen we just send the curse out of you and all is well  ashley i guess this sounds so ridiculous as im saying it out loud  travis i mean do you want to go see another cleric 
none	 and see if you even  need to exercise or not  marisha very fit  laura very strong  ashley i feel like i like the mindreading serum we could just see  we have four days til a full moon  taliesin we should start consecrating the ground at the very least  liam also do we really imagine whatever trouble they might be bringing to pikes doorstep is  something we cant handle i mean weve dealt with pretty terrible things i have a hard time  imagining it could be worse im not saying its not 
none	 dangerous it should be  travis avarice  liam oh i got a nosebleed we could just do i mean keyleth could do her trick of turning us  into ladybugs or flies or whatever and we could all hang out and follow along i mean  mindreading first  ashley i think youre allowed to be there  laura yeah we can be there  liam we can just be there they dont care oh i was shooting guns today  marisha ogden at dinner the other night said that each generation is affected by a blood curse and 
none	  he believes its you in this generation because you and jb are in the same age right so youre  the same generation so maybe percys theory isnt quite wrong  sam percys very smart  marisha i dont know  taliesin i tend to veer towards the worstcase scenario somebody has to  laura will jb be there at the exorcism  taliesin that is a question  laura we need to make sure she is just in case  marisha or isnt just in case right  laura no if there is a curse and she is 
none	 affected it would be good to get it  out of her as well  marisha but what if it goes out of pike and into her  travis what if it goes out of her and into pike  marisha man so many variables  sam we should all be there together because stronger in numbers and if pikes lying to us we  kill her and if jbs lying to us we kill her  ashley well hold on well okay yeah if it comes down to that everybody we have to know  that that has to 
none	 be  laura laughs were not going to kill you  sam no if youre infected with evil we might have to  travis yeah what does it do do you turn into a crazy beast  ashley i have no idea  travis like do you get tentacles  ashley thats i feel like that would be an upgrade  travis thats not really that bad  ashley no i doubt thats what it is  travis maybe were approaching this the wrong way  ashley im intrigued by this mindreading serum  sam ive never used it so 
none	 it should probably work great  laura how much was that  sam about a thousand  liam thats not bad  travis do it  marisha i mean maybe ogden just isnt telling you things because hes so old its locked away  and he doesnt remember you know  laura maybe we just have to ask  taliesin i would check both of them  travis do it  ashley all of them and astra  marisha how long does it last  sam i can only i think investigate one person or gnome at a time but 
none	 then i can move the  spell to other people let me doty give me my notes on the spell that i took hold on  liam what time is it right now  matt pushing close to dusk  laura 946  taliesin we should perhaps do this while were setting up the ritual  ashley yes  taliesin since itll just be up there and itll be natural to talk about this subject  ashley and to not go when its a full moon so we dont actually have to do it  but we can set it 
none	 up  taliesin exactly its going to take several days and im sure were  going to need their help  sam i can shift my attention to other creatures thoughts or go deeper into the same creatures  mind so i can do some surface scans and then if i get a hit i can go deeper  taliesin prod your fingers deep into the recesses the nooks and crannies of their  sam of course i still defer to you as my teammates i dont have to be the one who takes  this serum i did pay 
none	 for it but if one of you wanted to do the probing you could buy it off me  i suppose  ashley well i feel like they wouldnt be as onguard with you  laura yeah plus we already said youre gonna write a book about it  sam thats true it fits  marisha its an interview  laura thats really good  liam we could also just take them out for a drink and get their guard down  marisha you dont look like youre reading someones mind when youre doing it right  taliesin you dont 
none	 have to do this  laura you can definitely do it to ogden first then cause he wont be able to tell  sam he cant see  laura he cant see so if you look weird he wont know perfect cover  taliesin in case you have to look weird do you have to look weird while you do this  liam i mean you are dressed like a faberge egg  matt you are welcome to look weird while you do it  sam i feel like thats a compliment  liam lets go with that  ashley 
none	 is there anything do one of you guys wanna can one of you guys check me to see if  theres something in there that i dont know vax  travis you look good  marisha you dont look in her ear  travis why not  liam i dont think so i mean youre the holiest person in this city  laura can you check yourself just pray to sarenrae see if shell give you a little hint  marisha dont you have that divine interventiony thing that dear sarenwae sarenrae  ashley deaw sarenwae  laughter  taliesin 
none	 are you listening sarenrae its me pike  laughter  ashley tonight ill see if maybe i can get some answers but should we do we do this tonight  this mindreading serum  taliesin i say tomorrow on the mountain  sam i was gonna say its four days right  taliesin yeah weve got to start right now  sam well i think we do it while were up there  marisha is it four days and on that night  matt four nights from tonight  marisha four nights from tonight  taliesin so we have to 
none	 start this immediately  matt pretty soon make a history check percival  taliesin no one bothered to listen to any of my exciting stories about my home all right thats  a 19  matt okay as far as from what pike told you as far as high up in the mountains and a good  place that you can imagine for a moonlit ceremony there is a place its a rock shelf to the  northeast of whitestone on the salted bluffs its called the dawn table  taliesin the dawn table  matt its a rock shelf 
none	 used for prayer when the spring rolls around a lot of fishermen go there  and leave offerings its meant to bring i wouldnt say a good harvest but a good season for  catching fish and trying to bring food back to whitestone so thats pretty high up its gonna  be probably about two and a half days travel on foot  taliesin but we can carpet or teleport  matt if you have a way of getting there  marisha are there trees nearby are there trees nearby  taliesin ill see if i can recall if 
none	 theres a tree nearby  matt that part of the mountain is pretty they do have trees but the trees are pretty thin  theyre like pine tree that wide at the most and you need a pretty thick tree to  transport via plants  marisha i can get us close  taliesin we can certainly get closer  matt you can cut off about half a days travel about a days worth of travel i guess  marisha we can also travel via being clouds like weve done in the past  travis we really dont wanna walk 
none	 its so lovely out danger is at an alltime low  marisha or we can just hike and enjoy the scenery it is a nice hike the canyons yeah  its rained a lot this winter  laura is it okay to leave everyone here while we go  taliesin its only a few days  sam weve got the musketeers guarding the place  liam kynans on it  marisha so okay if its two and a half days journey and were planning on doing this then we  would have to take ogden and the gnomes and all 
none	 things needed for this ritual right  laura yeah i think so  marisha it means we would at least be framing it like were committing i mean that gives you a  long hike to be able to talk and mindread the gnomes while we walk  sam it lasts for one minute  marisha it gives you a solid good minute of hiking to read the gnomes  taliesin maybe during the ritual setup because i dont know would it work while youre walking  sam i mean maybe but i feel like we wait for the big 
none	 moment and then see whats going on in  his head  marisha all right  sam its more dramatic that way anyway for the book and for our lives  ashley and just so you guys know ive been discussing with what vex knows about it as well i  think from what he said its like a bunch of shapes come out and we would  all have to fight them  laura shades  ashley shades shades shades  sam way to bury the lede pike  ashley i forgot about that my b  travis its 
none	 like im cool with shapes but  taliesin not a rhombus anything but that  ashley we dont know  marisha wait shades coming from you  laura maybe the curse jb had mentioned that the shades infest someone and hollow them out i dont  know what that translates to  marisha you dont look shady  strained laughter  marisha vax can you do a thing to look inside of pike  travis yeah xray her  laura try it just try it  liam the best i can do i mean i can cast divine sense and 
none	 lay on hands and i mean i  can poison and disease are things i can help with but not  travis well you dont even know give it a try  laura divine sense divine sense that sounds like something real  liam lets find out if youre a fiend or undead  travis yeah  liam and i do it  matt all right you sit there and you close your eyes and you focus in front of you on pikes gnome  form interestingly enough   you get nothing  travis oh shut up man dont 
none	 fucking do that shit  laughter  liam youre welcome  ashley okay  sam shes not wearing a wire shes okay  liam is there some embarrassing thing hidden tucked away that you dont like to talk about  like are you afraid of pickles or you dont want to be  ashley no i mean i talk about everything with you guys  sam theres no secrets that you have  travis you dont chew on your own toenails or anything  sam no singular secret that youve kept from the entire group the entire time weve known 
none	 you  taliesin i feel like chewing on your own toenails is the worst villain origin possible  ashley of course i chew on my own toenails i mean  sam theres not some deep secret that youre keeping from us  ashley no i mean i think about one time with scanlan  marisha wait i feel like a story was starting  laura she was about to say something  ashley no you guys know this when i got in a lot of trouble for taking a shit on that bed or  killing the guy with the 
none	 mace or sometimes ill go to a brothel  but i dont do anything that bad  laura thats not bad  ashley i dont know i dont know if theres anything in there  taliesin im highly dubious of this entire endeavor  laura i think you need to talk to sarenrae  ashley okay well when should we leave  marisha well two and a half days i can teleport us closer and then we can either hike or cloud  the rest of the way  laura would you be able to cloud the gnomes too though 
none	  matt probably not in one casting but you could do doublecast like two trips and get all of you up  pretty quick  sam but then well be sitting there for two days  marisha with the gnomes or the tree stride or teleport via plants  matt well teleport via plants whoever can fit through there in that short time you can probably  get you guys and the gnomes through but referring to your wind walk which how many targets can  that affect at once up to ten willing creatures  marisha and theres how 
town	 many gnomes  matt theres four  marisha four  matt so youd leave one behind  marisha then wed leave one behind okay  matt which youd have to talk to them about that  ashley are there any other clerics that we know  liam not in town on your level  matt theres keeper yennen but hes like  laura yeah where did kash go to in the last year  matt kash has been in vasselheim  liam i mean and vasselheim is chock full of clerics so maybe we could find help there  taliesin 
town	 gilmores out of town  ashley okay maybe we go ask them and say  laura yennen  ashley the family i mean it sounds crazy but maybe we just go up there go through the  motions  travis yeah its your show  laura just do it  taliesin lets do it im going to get some tents and some food put together so were at least  comfortable  sam are we walking or can we get some horses at least  taliesin its not really horseaccessible  laura well be fine tary  sam im worried 
none	 about the big guy  taliesin the big guy will be fine  sam i guess he can just walk  taliesin he can cloudstride as well  laura well no doty cant mistform right  liam can trinket and doty ride in your  laura no doty ive tried to put him in the  taliesin one of us in theory should actually perhaps take the carpet so we can put doty on the  carpet  liam im sitting on the carpet right now  laura how heavy is doty  sam let me look at matts statistics 
none	  matt doty technically counts as a creature though it is much like a golem or a construct of  some kind it would be considered a creature it is a construct so in theory you would have to  tell doty doty turn into wind and that probably would work  sam i could do that  marisha it would take a slot out of our ten  sam how fast does this cloud thing move  matt it moves pretty quick 300 feet flying speed of 300 which is ten times as fast as you  walk and 
none	 without going straight up the mountain you could make the full journey talking with  percy about this from the base of the mountain to the dawn table in about two hours  taliesin we wouldnt even need the treestride to be honest we could just do it  marisha wait from here to the base of the mountain  taliesin i mean we could do from the base of the mountain to the top in two hours three hours but  we could make the entire journey quite quickly  laura so she could just doublecast  matt the 
none	 entire journey you could make in about six and a half hours  laura solid so some people go up you come back turn the rest of the people in  marisha with my treestride  laura no  matt without treestride  marisha with the gas  liam lets go glamping  marisha lets go glamping but as long as i can sleep afterwards  taliesin well bring tents were going to bring some nice tents  matt it lasts for eight hours so youll be using most of the duration to get there you could  probably fly 
none	 back if you want to or treestride back if you had a tree you could find up there to  do it so yeah you could do that  marisha i do that  matt okay so what do you do you go and gather up the other trickfoots you approach the rest of  them ogden jb  marisha were not leaving tonight right  matt whenever you guys want to  marisha tonight this is the same night we got back  laura oh right it is  taliesin in the morning  laura okay well leave in 
none	 the morning yeah  sam at dawn we leave  ashley so ill go to them at dinner okay so weve had some discussions and i think itll take  us a little bit of time to get up there and do whatever settingup you need to do on the top of  the mountain so we were thinking if you guys are okay with this of leaving tomorrow morning  matt you can see johann and astra kind of turn over to ogden ogden goes yes that would be  perfect when is the next full moon  ashley 
none	 its in four days  matt four days all right that gives us time to prepare i need a few things for this ritual  ashley okay  matt i dont know how to retrieve them necessarily i require a jug of water that has  been blessed by a priest of the moonweaver the moonweaver is one of the gods largely elven  worship you guys have crossed a number of temples that worship the moonweaver in syngorn and some  other you do find them occasionally in civilization but theyre more the kind of shrines  that you 
none	 find out in the center of the forest  laura i can totally get that  matt goddess of the moonlight and autumn he says also as part of a reagent for the  exorcism a diamond worth no less than 1000 gold pieces that will be  consumed by the actual ritual  taliesin thats doable i believe  matt i also need a solid pound of dried lavender and a half a pound of powdered sulfur  taliesin im pretty sure we have access to that  matt and of course you pike and that should be sufficient 
none	 to complete the ritual  laura shes not going to be injured in this ritual  matt no no either the shade is cast out and destroyed or its cast out and then you destroy  it either way you should be fine  laura just the one shade then  matt depends  travis youve done this before  matt twice three times  travis and its always gone right  matt its gone right twice  travis what happened the time it didnt  matt that was the first time i didnt know what i was in for 
dung	 and i couldnt save them  travis oh shit  laura right what do the people look like after theyve been taken over  matt and you see he gets really dark and focused in himself for a second you see the glimmer  across the glasses on his face and he goes they begin to grow hatred for all those they once  loved they begin to strike out at the world around them take whatever they like and those  that stand in their way are merely to be cut down eventually at least from what ive seen 
none	 they  continue to take until somebody cuts them down  laura do they just look like  matt they just look like themselves but their whole personality changes  travis cool im encouraged  laura maybe they just turned into an asshole  ashley that just sounds like someone whos an asshole  taliesin nothing a little lavender and sulfur cant cure in my experience  ashley i dont feel any of these things  matt what ive seen are just the visions ive had if you wish not to go through with this that  is up to 
dung	 you we can leave and be on our way ive just come to help if we can if we do this ritual  and nothing comes of it then youre right as rain  liam do you have any inkling of what would happen if you do nothing pike does nothing  matt perhaps not now but someday in the future when met with a terrible choice if you choose a  darker path that may be the window needed for the shades to take hold and begin to install in their  dark interests  travis are there any 
none	 elements needed for this water fire  matt well i need some blessed water  laura which im totally going to go get  travis right you did say that  liam i have the lavender  matt the sulfur represents the earth the diamond represents the refraction of the moonlight and  the water is the catalyst  marisha and the lavender and sulfur  matt the lavender is to be burned the sulfur represents the earth in this place but the  lavender is burned as a sort of incense that helps provide a space of the hallowed 
none	 ground to present  a cage for this entity so it cannot flee and come back  travis we gotta find a priest  taliesin im going to go get a pound for good measure  laura they have all that shit in syngorn i can just go right to one of the temples of the moonweaver or  something  matt you could probably get most of that in syngorn with one trip yeah  laura solid  marisha what if what youre seeing ogden and i mean no disrespect in any way is a possible  outcome or 
none	 future that might not ever happen  matt then pike will be safe ill look the fool and well go our separate ways  taliesin whats a diamond  laura whats a diamond for our dear pike its a good price i say  ashley i say what you say that is what i say i say you know what im bored and i think we  should do it even if its hogwash no offense  matt none taken  marisha and as percy and tary as the science bros have said several times at least a negative  
none	 outcome is still an outcome or something like that  taliesin something similar to it  sam yes yes  marisha yeah well learn things for science  sam for science  ashley for science  taliesin exorcism for science why not  laughter  matt thats a good bumper sticker  laura i should probably go to syngorn before it gets too late  taliesin well get the lavender and sulfur together  liam i have lavender with my armor  marisha you need a pound of it  liam i have a pound of lavender with my armor 
none	  laughter  taliesin im sure i can dig up a pound of sulfur i figured lets just get double what we need  just to be safe  laura just to be safe do you have two pounds of lavender  taliesin we need half a pound  ashley do you just tuck it in to make it smell nice  matt you can cause existing lavender to bloom stronger otherwise the lavender you create in the  space will vanish once the spell is done but yeah  liam its not in my i keep it in a 
none	 box with my armor so the armor wont smell like shit anymore  people its not is there a problem with a man having lavender in his possession  taliesin you keep your armor in a box filled with lavender  liam yes i do  laura yeah so it smells fresh and clean  taliesin does it smell fresh and clean  liam it does now man  taliesin all right  liam ive had 12 months of downtime to figure my shit out my armor is tight now  taliesin your armor now smells like a grandmothers bathroom 
none	  liam take your guilt trips and bring them back to dad i dont need them  laura what are you talking about im on my way to go give those guilt trips  sam i have little potpourri bags in almost everything i own  taliesin he does its true  travis really  sam yes  laura he started leaving them around the house  taliesin he calls them sachets  sam lets do it  matt all right so you guys go to bed  laura i go to syngorn  matt okay  travis can i 
none	 attune to my blood axe instead of the thrower before i go to sleep  matt that you can  travis thank you  taliesin im going to let the castle know im taking a brief brief run up the hill and grabbing  supplies for this so letting everyone know grabbing a few tents  matt they have supplies for you at the ready you gather them easily from the pale guard they have  some tents that havent been used for a while you take those with you supplies are given you head  to syngorn make an 
none	 investigation check  laura i should probably have brought someone with me just in case i suck at this thats cocked  thats cocked if ive ever seen cocked  liam thats good thats a good one  laura investigation 20  matt yeah within a short time as the evening draws in its not a full moon but its still a  very big moonlit night and you find in syngorn one of the larger temples to the moonweaver theres a  night guide there named nusem and its the temple of the pale light and so as you 
none	 approach him and  give your request hes like a jug of our blessed water that is an unusual request we take  no money but offerings in trade of equal value as you honestly see fit  travis give him a highfive  laughter  laura right well i dont have very much on my person  matt whatever you feel would be a viable trade within the eyes of the moonweaver herself  laura what do i know about the moonweaver  matt roll a religion check  laura oh god imma roll my moonstone dice for this 
none	  matt do it  laura what am i rolling  matt religion  laura a religion jeez 11  matt 11 you know that she is the goddess of the moon the night and of autumn she is known as  she doesnt fall on the good or bad spectrum shes generally a bit of a trickster but however  tends to be used or at least called to by young love to bless trysts to not be discovered thats  kind of the gist of what you can pick up on that roll yeah  laura all right 
dung	 i have a small flask of courage i feel like she would appreciate this  matt takes a moment looks at it i think the goddess will be pleased and he puts it in his  robes and he takes the blessed water and hands it to you its a small pretty heavy especially  when its filled clay pot that is sealed at the top with multiple rounds of rope and some sort of  a dark black tarlike substance that seems to seal the top and he passes it over to you  and you take it  
none	 laura i didnt think this part through thank you very much  liam strength of seven  laura thats right what is my strength it is seven im as weak as grog is stupid  laughter  laura no im just a little bit stronger not quite as bad  matt all right so you gather that you find your way back without issue well say without issue  laura you know what im just gonna pass it over to trinket and make him hold it  matt okay so you attach it to trinkets armor on the top easy 
town	 enough so you guys eventually make  your way back to the town you guys find an evening of rest you complete restore your  spells you sulfur go ahead and make a tinkering check this is intelligence modifier and  proficiency bonus  taliesin thats okay 19  matt yeah okay for you cause most of the sulfur that you have currently has already been  put in with the salpeter and other means of creating the gunpowder so you have to  reverseengineer a lot of it its not going to be pure what you have or at 
none	 least not all of it i  mean you have some pure sulfur still but to get the full halfpound of it its gonna be a little  dirty but you manage to get it to happen and vax is providing the lavender okay all righty and  the diamond whos giving the diamond or do you have one  laura ive got a diamond  matt how much is it worth  laura ive got multiple diamonds  matt well choose a diamond  laura ill choose one thats worth in my bag of gems no thats not right 
none	  liam in my nah right here in my nope  laura all right fine ive got two diamonds both worth 1500 i dont have a thousandgold  diamond  matt all right thatll suffice  laura yeah but its a waste its okay  ashley its a waste of 500  matt all righty so  laura its pike its worth it  matt as the morning comes you all awaken you gather your materials you assess as a pool what  you have at your disposal and presenting these various elements that youve gathered before uncle  ogden 
none	 he inspects each one very carefully sniffing the sulfur feeling and tasting the  lavender takes the water and brushes his fingers through it takes the diamond and inspects it  sets it all down on the table and goes yes this will suffice whenever youre ready lets  make our way to wherever you find is necessary to do this ritual  taliesin i think youll be quite pleased  matt very well  laura keep an eye on those goods brother  matt trickfoots trickfoots trickfoots theyre all right around him and hes like  hello anyone johann 
none	 reaches out and touches his shoulder ah yes there you are come we  have an exorcism and so they follow you as you grab your materials how are you doing this  youre doing multiple trips  marisha i was treestriding us all to the base of the mountain right  sam nope you were gonna gas us all the way there  marisha thats what im doing okay doublegas  taliesin its a gas  matt okay early morning with the wind walk you can get ten creatures which is you seven plus  you put trinket in 
none	 your necklace doty which is eight and you can take two of the gnomes if youd  like or would you prefer to leave with the four of them and them come back for them  taliesin i would say lets get all of the gnomes up there first so they can begin setting  everything up  laura yeah ill stay behind  liam ill go with  sam ill stay behind as well  marisha no im gonna take tary  sam i bid you adieu  laughter  laura percy can stay right  taliesin ill stay 
none	 as well  sam ugh gross  marisha im making a trip back im gonna take tary pike the gnomes vax me how manys left  thats it right  taliesin take doty so he can set up the tents  laura i think you can take everyone except for me and percy right  taliesin yeah that should work  travis yeah please i wanna go with pike  marisha and grog will go  matt all right so you guys go ahead and utilizing the  marisha why dont you guys start off on the rug  laura 
none	 oh you know what you can treestride us through and then you guys head up and then well  just meet you up there on the broom  marisha that is a good idea thats what ill do ill treestride some through  laura just me and percy  matt all right easy enough to do youve seen these woods or the perimeter of the woods at  least so you know vaguely a tree in the direction that percy points you towards so with that you  touch the edge of the sun tree the exterior of it opens 
none	 into a doorway and through that laughs  the trustfall that is percival and vex rushing through the sun tree before it closes behind you  trust that they are at the destination required and will meet you there  marisha ill meet you there  matt it closes  taliesin lock the door  matt and with that with the supplies gathered the rest of you all have the spell commence and  you are able to concentrate for a minute to turn your physical form into that of a white  cloudlike mist you watch as the gnomes 
none	 do so and this is the first time youre doing this as  well taryon and its a unique experience youre about as giddy internally that you cannot express  it through word because you are a cloud of mist but you watch as the smaller gnome mists also kind  of appear and some of them start swirling around excitedly and one of them just seems to drift  laura laughs oh no oh no  matt one of the other ones comes by and cuts it off and shows the direction  laughter  matt eventually you guys 
none	 start making your way  laura hes sleeping  travis snoring  matt following towards the path which percival pointed you guys so this is about a sixplushour  journey as youre coasting over the entirety of the parchwood forest and it is beautiful its  actually not too cloudy today youve come past winters crest its been a few weeks since  marisha sings butterfly in the sky  marisha ashley and matt sing i can fly twice as high  matt yeah so you get a few dotted clouds in the sky but for the most part there 
none	 is blue visible  and there is sunshine coming down pelors blessing upon the land of the alabaster sierras  after quite some time and having to maybe go back a few times to keep everyone together as you have  four people who have never done this before who are just awed by this you lead them towards the  northeast very very top of the salted bluffs of the alabaster sierras and you begin to see what  percival described to you which is a shelflike bluff at the very top where you see a few  clusters 
none	 of rock and one large rock archway that comes up right to the cliff before it drops down  into the sea to the north and this is where these offerings were left eventually you guys make your  way there and given the speed you still get there before vax and percy do  marisha really  matt yes  liam vex and percy  matt sorry vex and percy five years of this and let this be a lesson for when you name your  characters for your campaign as you guys approach you all condense back into 
none	 your mist  form except for the four other clouds that are all circling and circling  sam they dont know how to break it do they damn it  matt eventually one of them kind of congeals and turns back and its jb  marisha i wouldve told them  matt well you do now and they all eventually come back and you see before you its this  clifftop flat entry with a series of rocks that jut out at certain places and rubble and some  general erosion has occurred and there at the very edge of 
none	 the cliff and it is this cliff that  shoots out over you can look over the side and see the sea to the northeast just above the  shearing cliffs you see the sunlight hitting thousands upon thousands of small distant  sparkles as the waves catch elements of the sunlight down below and as you come up to the  edge and look down it is a very very long fall thousands and thousands and thousands of feet to  rocks and ocean  liam right on the edge looking down  matt but theres a large stone 
none	 archway there  travis are you wearing your armor  liam i am yeah we left we packed up some thoughts i just have inside my head  laura are me and percy there yet  matt not yet you guys are just making your way there you do notice the rock archway looks both  ancient and very wellconstructed and its impressive that even though the erosion and the  nature of the strong cliffside winds that come up there its kept as well as it has you also see a  number of longrotted baskets and sacks and 
town	 dried decomposing fruits and fish bones you can see  where basically the remnants of different offerings were left up here as part of the pelor  blessing to the fishermen that walk through the salted bluffs eventually vex and percival make  their way up here as well and you guys are now full journey about midafternoon with three days  until the full moon  sam three days to kill  laura hey that cliffs really high  marisha well time to pitch a tent and make it fabulous  laura lets not do the ritual site right 
none	 next to that cliff  ashely thats a great idea is there a way to move it sort of  laura  inward  matt you can move back a bit yeah the bluff itself is maybe about 70 feet from one side to the  other its flat so you can move it further back towards this edge of the cliff as opposed to  being the one thats seaside  laura yeah yeah  matt okay so you guys have a few days here to relax get to know each other ask questions and  hear stories about 
none	 young pike embarrasingly get to tell them of the tales of what you guys have  done and inform them from a firsthand basis of what vox machina has accomplished for the past few  years they all seem enraptured jb more than anybody and she seems to almost finish some of  the tales you get the sense that shes been very very wellversed in what you guys have done and is  genuinely invested in the stories as they happen anything else you guys want to accomplish in the  three days in particular  liam i think 
none	 the twins will probably look around and make sure that nobody has been here recently  other than us or see if theres anything hinky  matt make an investigation check  laura yeah we do that definitely 23  liam eight  matt okay you do note this in the first couple days while its been long blownover and  destroyed and scattered you do see elements that seem like a large nest that have been  windscattered up here and left for a long time and as you look through the chunks and pieces you  see bits 
none	 of dried leather flesh and with that in mind over the next two days you begin to see  way off in the north what appear to be a number of flying entities that group in clusters that  kind of exist over the cliffside down along the actual mountain edge and occasionally have  apparently made distant nests and are still maneuvering in the distance  laura do i see the type of feather it is can i tell what kind of creature it was  matt make a perception check  laura 32  matt using the combination 
none	 of your broom and your rangerlike vision youve encountered these  creatures once before at the salted bluff but avoided them there are small clusters of harpies  that make their home here on the cliffsides by the ocean  laura yeah they took all our horses  matt yep they picked them apart last time you first made your way to whitestone so youre very  careful to make sure that whatever camp you set up is camouflaged as best as possible since that is  one of your specialties as a ranger its not too bad go ahead 
none	 and make a stealth check please  this will be your stealth check for the camp  laura i cant cast pass without a trace  matt not on your camp  laura no probably not  liam come on rogue  matt ill say for the purposes of that no  laura do i laughs im scared to ask it okay what am i rolling what am i adding  matt add your stealth  laura 22  matt okay so  laura but would i have used my what is that shit hide in plain sight  could 
none	 i have used that  matt not on a camp for yourself maybe and it helps you it allows you your ability to  camouflage elements of your space allows you to help and use your stealth for this whole endeavor  but two days go by harpies dont seem to pay mind theres a couple of close calls where a  couple fly overhead but you all see them coming and get low and tell the gnomes to go inside and  get behind the rocks and they seem to pass without actually noticing your presence  laura thats 
none	 good thats good  matt eventually you make your way to the fourth day and the sun begins to set at which point  the gnomes begin to gather up with the rest of you and ogden hobbles his way in your direction  going waiting for her to cross camera okay laughs the time is nigh we must prepare the ritual  and for the purposes of this can we bring in the battlemap that is on this side  sam battlemap just call it a map matt dont call it a battlemap  matt this side please  
none	 ashley battlemap over there that means theres another one over there  travis there are several options i think  laura what here it comes here comes the battlemap here it comes  sam oh my god what is this theres color changes happening  laura its like the birthday cake coming out  matt this ways great  impressed noises  taliesin okay thats a lot  liam that is extra  sam its weird the blue light makes it almost i cant even see what it is  marisha its hard to see with the blue light  
none	 matt is it really thats a problem  sam its okay well figure it out  marisha it could be this monitor i dont know  matt all right so here are the gnomes clustered  sam matt in preparation for this ritual i would like to cast can doty use an item that i cast  magic into  matt doty cannot i believe  sam okay well then ill cast revivify into one of my coins and give it to vex and say use this  on me if i fall oh and also ill give her my 
town	 five needle arrows that i made  laura what are these  sam theyre just regular arrows that have a 1 to hit  laura badass  sam so just a little extra accuracy  laura tary you just keep surprising me  sam youre worth it  ashley with ogden saying theyre ready can i just be alone in the tent for a second  matt sure and actually this is a point as well because part of this was supposed to be hallowed  ground which requires the hallow spell which is a 24hour casting period or let 
none	 me see the  actual casting time on that you would know this and he would have spoken to you in advance to do  this so well say yeah hallow its casting time is 24 hours the herbs and oils and incense  required to do this one alone costs 1000 gold which the spell consumes so thats 1000 gold you  have to mark off to do this  laura thats party funds we got you  matt but you infuse this area with holy energy during this time period you guys are waiting and  doing so 
none	 this whole ground becomes hallowed now you get to choose a second effect of this if  youd like which is affected creatures cant be frightened while in the area darkness fills the  area if thats what you want daylight fills the area dont know if thats going to affect the  ritual or not seeing as how its a moonlightbased element affected creatures have  resistance to one type of damage of your choice except for bludgeoning piercing and slashing  you can have energy vulnerability silence what would you prefer  ashley i think to not be 
none	 frightened  matt okay affected creatures cannot be frightened so any of you and any creatures that  end up in the space cannot be frightened the 60foot radius which is pretty much most of this  area becomes hallowed so as the night draws to a darkened close or as the day draws to a  darkened close you guys can choose your positions to prepare for this  laura oh jeez  marisha it takes pike 24 hours to cast this  matt yes  marisha so we have to protect her for 24 hours yeah  matt 
none	 yeah well say this happened this isnt the ritual this is a different spell to prepare  for the ritual so while you were doing this was during the time in which you managed to go ahead  and avoid being seen and use your stealthiness this was in advance of it the hallow spell has  been completed the area has been locked in the spell is cast now the final ritual is mounting  so at this point youre asked for some help by ogden to move some of these rocks out of the way  you guys 
none	 slowly shift this pile of rocks over here he begins to then with the help of jb take  the sulfur and begin to scatter it around in a circle in this opening right here so the other  two are gonna stay back  taliesin i think im gonna want some high ground up on that hill  matt up on there all right so percival gets up onto the high ground there all righty  laura ill get on the high part on the other side  matt over here all righty  travis i would like to 
none	 stay near pike if i can  matt all righty so you want to stay near this central rock there  travis yeah as long as im out of the way of the ritual just near pike  laura trinket stays near grog  matt okay trinkets gonna hang next to grog perfect  liam im gonna play lookout and go out towards the edge past the arch but sink in against the  wall a bit and hide  matt there a bit right there  liam into the cracks of it yeah  matt okay so youre hiding 
none	 on this side poking through keyleth  marisha ill go by that spire closest to you  matt over here  marisha yeah little close to the stalagtite  matt over here  marisha yeah thank you  matt okay theres keyleth taryon  sam im just gonna stay where the gnomes are all within 30 feet of me so close to the action  matt okay so pretty much where you are okay  sam within visual 30 feet  matt got you so pike the circle puts you at about there in the centerpiece you watch as the 
none	  sulfur is drawn around you in a wide circle all right jb now begins taking the water and  splashing it throughout the center of the circle she opens the jug with the help of grog and walks  around with grog and is just taking big handfuls and splashing all the blessed water to fill in the  circle between oh god where the sulfur was in the interior of it all around so it soaks all  the dirt you can see it actually goes darker in color as it absorbs the liquid and it seems you 
none	  can now very very clearly see the circle and at this point as the night has really hit the  moonlight the full moon is plainly visible and that bright bright white moonlight is making  stark shadows and a very visible perspective of everything on this field so pike youre asked  to stand in the center there as right over here next to taryon facing you ogden hobbles over  looks at you he holds the diamond in his hand pike are you ready  ashley two seconds just quietly just sort of muttering to myself or 
none	 not to myself to  sarenrae i dont know what this is i just hope that youre here and watching and please be by my  side and guide this ritual if it is your will okay im ready  matt okay ogden is holding the diamond out close your eyes concentrate on the goodness  within you he holds the diamond out in front of him and just starts chanting  slowly under his breath  sam okay im gonna drink the potion of mind reading  matt okay you drink the potion of mind reading  sam yes 
none	  matt okay hes loudly  laura what if hes stealing her soul  matt hes holding this diamond forward and hes loudly speaking in a language i dont think any of  you understand mutters gibberish  sam im going to scan his surface thoughts what is most on his mind in that moment  matt currently at that moment it sounds like a bunch of gibberish mutters gibberish  laura what is he speaking  sam as an action if its my turn again i will attempt to probe deeper into  the same creatures mind  matt 
none	 okay  sam he makes a wisdom saving throw  matt against a dc of  sam 13 its not very good  matt okay as you focus your attention pushing in to probe deeper all you get is the gibberish  sam more gibberish  matt natural 17 sorry  sam ugh waste of 1000 bucks  laura you cant try the other gnomes  sam i believe that breaks the spell  matt is that what it says  sam it says if i probe deeper he makes a wisdom saving throw if he succeeds the spell ends 
none	 and  hes aware i was probing  matt as hes chanting mutters gibberish pauses continues to mutter gibberish goes right  back into concentrating again  sam the plan failed the plan failed  matt what languages do you know  sam i know sylvan common gnome draconic undercommon  matt languages  taliesin common celestial elven  marisha common elven celestial sorry sylvan druidic primordial  liam common elven and abyssal  laura elvish common undercommon abyssal and draconic  ashley gnomish common undercommon dwarvish  travis come on  laughter  matt barely common  travis i 
none	 just have spoken giant thats it  matt okay none of you know the language hes speaking it just sounds like gibberish to you  oh and dwarvish because you have the belt as he begins chanting the diamond begins to glow  faintly a greenish color just very very on the inside just eversogently he begins to chant  louder and louder louder gibberish as he does the diamond flashes brighter and brighter green  and eventually the green coloration fades and the diamond vanishes from his hand  sam another thousand  matt and he falls to his 
none	 knees heavy breathing look and as he points forward towards pike  you guys glance over and look at pike and you watch as from the ground around her this black  cloudlike mass begins to pour out of her legs and knees in a swirl around her person you pike  look around you as it begins to fill the space around you and it begins to coalesce into this  large cloud of darkness it rumbles and gathers like a miniature thunderstorm and you watch as  the clouds begin to churn forming dozens of screaming faces  
none	 all wailing in a discordant moan  sam that dont look good thats tall  matt roll initative  yelling  laura oh my god i totally thought he was gonna steal your soul and stick you in that diamond i  was like this was a bad idea  matt all righty whos at the top weve got 25 to 20  liam 21  taliesin 22  travis 20  ashley this music  matt all righty 20 to 15  laura 18  matt 18  marisha 15  matt 15 keyleth  sam my plan was 
none	 foolproof  matt 15 to ten  laura you really shouldve tried that when he was speaking english  matt ten to five  laura common  marisha oh sorry eight sorry  ashley pike fashion  matt tary whatd you get  sam three  travis laughs that happens a lot for you  liam if it makes you feel better i rolled a one and used luck  sam and then got  liam 21  sam oh jesus  matt percival youre up first  taliesin just cause this things weird first thing im gonna do is 
none	 im going to hit it with a  sharpshooter with wheres my runs with a deadeye so im getting advantage on it and  hitting with sharpshooter and lets see what happens  sam what if its good  taliesin with animus  sam you dont even know if its a good guy  travis is it surrounding pike or is it just next to pike  matt its pseudosurrounding her and right behind her like its kind of forming behind her and  adjacent to her body  travis what did you do  taliesin thats yeah 30 to 
none	 hit  matt okay go ahead and roll damage  taliesin thats my brain is made of swiss cheese here we go 1d10 plus 1d6 so thats  yeah thats nice so thats oh yeah thats really good 26 points of damage plus six points  of psychic damage and just because im irritated by this thing im gonna drop some cabals ruin  into it lets just drop wheres my pen heres my pen  sam wheres my pen  sam and matt they took my pen  taliesin lets drop five points of cabals ruin into that thats 
none	 5d6 if i recall  matt 5d6 of kids in the hall damage got it laughs  taliesin so thats ugh three four five ten points of lightning damage  matt got you so as you fire this is with bad news or with your  taliesin this is animus  matt this is animus okay so as you fire and turn it over you look down and watch as the  bullet just seems to pass through it and then almost catch the edge of the rock here and  splinter off and doesnt seem to affect it directly 
none	 at all  taliesin the lightning and the psychic didnt do anything  matt nope you watch as the energy kind of crackles and dissipates amongst the rock  sam wait no damage it took  liam best you can tell  travis doesnt seem to have affected it  sam oh shit  taliesin im going to i dont know what to do  marisha you just shot at it you didnt do anything  taliesin i just shot at it im going to attempt to hex it with a bonus action does it catch  matt okay you 
none	 go ahead and attempt to hex it as you focus on it nothing seems to hit  marisha including a hex  matt the hex has no effect and you dont sense any connection with this creature you dont see  any of the smoke or shadow surrounding it the hex has no effect  sam maybe its not there  taliesin maybe its an illusion im going to since i dont have much left i burnt a little  bit im just im going to reload hunker down and watch what happens im also going to watch  the 
none	 gnomes all of them are any of them doing weird shit thats where im gonna use the rest of  my turn to just look at the gnomes and see what theyre doing  matt okay right now the two other gnomes are just waiting off to the side watching aghast and  you watch as ogden is slowly with his staff backing up hand out looking freaked out backing  into taryon look over and noticing his presence and then focusing back on the horrible thing  thats surrounding pike right now and he looks genuinely frightened is that 
none	 your turn  taliesin thats my turn  matt okay percivals done vax youre up  liam before i decide what is the thing doing to pike what am i looking at  matt it hasnt had its turn yet youre watching this 12foottall swirling almost slowmoving  tornado of black cloud and smoke that is starting to form all these horrible faces forming this  cacophony of sounds and screaming and moaning  liam okay im gonna click the boots of haste im going to flip out the wings and then im  going to fly not through because 
none	 i dont wanna go by the thing but around towards keyleth and  around towards pike and grab pike and fly her up next to percival  matt fly her up next to percival okay so you try and pick her up make a strength check cause  she is a very heavily armored tiny little  ashley tank  matt tank of a gnome  laura strength check  liam i dont make those 17  matt 17 you do and it slows your movement to half when youre carrying her but you manage to pick  her up 
none	 as you do so you watch as the form sends this pseudopod of a screaming face and arm  swinging out towards you that is a 17  liam no  matt you just pull her out of reach as it swings out in your direction for the rest of your  movement you pull her just up to the edge of the rock there and you can set her down if you want  oh god is that your turn  liam yeah thats the end  matt okay that brings us to grog  travis gonna find out 
none	 what this thing is get up close and personal i would like to rage just  charge right at the thing that was towering over my buddy pike  matt right there you come up right to the side of it and you can look up and see it now its  forming this wall of screaming faces at you and a lot of them are watching as all of them are  facing pike as she disappears and all of a sudden all at once a hundred faces go shhhp to  you and gurgling growl what are you 
none	 doing  travis all eyes on me i swing at it the first one regular  matt okay  travis 28  matt 28 hits go ahead and roll damage  travis well see what happens now 24 points of damage  matt 24 points of damage as you rush up angrily you swing your axe with additional  travis necrotic four  matt all right 28 all right cool you swing and as your axe cleaves through the side of it  you watch as parts of it break open sending chunks of it flying and the creature shrieks 
none	  seems to scream in pain from the impact  travis nice it screamed in pain from the impact  laura okay  travis so the second one can i make it we dont know how high this thing is can i do a  great weapon master for the second one  matt sure  travis okay minus five thats gonna miss thats 18  matt 18 you hit go ahead and roll damage  travis oh really 18 hit okay shit 36 36 points of damage  laura did you add your necrotic  travis nope sorry i 
dung	 havent used the blood axe in a while 39 points of damage three points of  necrotic  matt that great weapon master man  travis i know thats why i wanted the blood axe back missed it  matt you swing with the second strike this time you watch as some of the faces implode at the  impact and you see a flash of dark matter just get strung out about three or four feet from it as  you strike through and it shrieks gives a horrible scream in pain as it does so  travis okay 
none	 thats it no bonus action  matt youre not going frenzied  travis no  matt okay that ends grogs turn it is now the creatures turn its going to move moving  upwards and trying to catch up to pike but because of the nature of the hallowed ground it  gets that far and then stops and is held in place  travis do i get an opportunity  matt you do go ahead and roll an attack  travis can i make it reckless  matt mmhm actually i think reckless has to be on the first 
none	 attack of your round  travis okay thats fair enough shit i picked it up i think it was a seven so 23  matt yeah you hit  travis okay thats a 12 again 26  matt 26 all right with it being downed by that movement it moves in and makes its way towards  ogden ogden who is backed up against you at this point taryon you watch as the spectacles you  push him forward yelps as it swings forward and you see two of the mouths reach out to attempt  to thats a three 
none	 laughs both snap and the old gnome wouldve been bit except you pushed him  forward and he kind of like catches himself and both of them miss him by but an inch and he turns  around glancing at it still has his hand forward like no as hes clutching his staff at his  side to keep his standing that finishes the creatures turn vex youre up  laura okay i what is jb doing  matt jb is over here by trinket and is currently seeing this whole thing occur and is about to go  ahead 
none	 its not her turn yet but shes going to probably looks like shes heading that direction  to dart behind the rock  laura okay trinkets gonna go run at im gonna hunters mark it if i can  matt as you concentrate hunters mark finds no purchase on the creature  laura fucker all right trinket runs up i have a feeling this is and he is going to i dont  know do i get one attack and trinket gets one attack is that how it can work or he only gets a  bonus attack if i 
none	 take an attack  matt you either give trinket the full round of attacks and then you get one attack as a bonus  action or you get two attacks and then trinket gets a bonus action attack  laura okay and i already tried to hunters mark him  matt you did as a bonus action  laura so im gonna have trinket attack him down there  matt okay so two attacks from trinket go for it  travis cmon trink  laura okay okay okay one is a 25 and the other one is a 19  
none	 matt both hit go ahead and roll damage  laura oh thats not as very good nine for his bite  matt nice  laura and then his claw oh come on trinket 12 for no 11 for his claws  matt 20 points of damage from trinket not bad trinket rushes out and bites into the smoky faces  and pulls back and you watch as some of the shadow gets yanked with the teeth and then  disperses and then vanishes in the air and then turns around big raking claw and part of its  midsection shifts 
none	 with the impact and has to reform  travis whispers what is this thing  matt you gonna stay where you are  laura im gonna stay where i am and i wanna keep eyes on ooh i wonder if you have to be in the  circle to do damage fuck  marisha was percy not in the circle before  laura no  marisha thats interesting  sam but groggypoo was  marisha and trinket was  laura im gonna stay out im gonna keep eyes on jb to see what shes doing  matt okay that finishes 
none	 your turn  laura yeah  matt all righty keyleth youre up  marisha am i in the circle of what i know pike  matt you are you have to move five feet further in to be within the sulfur and water line  marisha okay hearing vex figure this out im gonna step forward just a little bit into the  sulfur line and then im gonna cast moonbeam right overtop of him at fourth level  matt okay  marisha and see what happens moonbeam so a shapechanger makes its saving throw with  disadvantage and if 
none	 it fails it instantly reverts to its original form if its a  shapechanger but i dont really know im just guessing  matt okay fivefoot radius yeah so you can it basically encompasses the whole size of the  creature so you watch as in the middle of the sky the full moon thats partially almost at its  zenith you watch as almost a secondary moon appears next to it for a moment and a single  column of bright moonlight hits the ground  marisha kinda harnessing the moon you know  matt yeah  marisha yeah 
none	 moon goddess shit yeah  matt and its illuminating the creature from the inside and where the smoke is you can now see  there are portions of it that are burning on the inside like theres small holes being dug through  it as the beam continues to focus on it are you gonna you can still move the rest of your  movement or you can stay where you are  marisha ill kind of shift towards the front of the column so i have the column behind my back  matt right there  marisha yeah  
none	 matt okay you leap over some of the leftover sacks and offerings there and put your back  against the column all right perfect that brings us to the gnomes turns these guys you  watch as johann and astra just move behind the side of the rock theyre too entranced to look  away but you guys seem to have this handled so theyre watching from the side you watch as ogden  begins to oh god he hobbles back behind you taryon and goes like excuse me and pushes  alongside you to move behind the rock here 
none	  sam i get an attack of opportunity  laughter  matt the creature does though and whoosh just misses over the top of his head the gnomes size  is too small and it keeps missing him by about a foot and he backs up going heavy breathing  holding onto his staff that ends his turn and you watch as jb rushes over behind this rock here  and starts shouting up ogden are you okay thats going to end her turn pike youre up  ashley okay am i able to get back into the circle how 
none	 far am i  matt you can yes  ashley all right  matt ill ask you to make an acrobatics check cause youre having to leap down from these large  fivefoot stone drops  ashley okay okay okay come on gil dont fuck me gil you fucked me gil four  laura oh no  matt so you leap down this one as you leap down to there as you hit the ground its just too  much height with all the heavy armor and all the chaos going on that when your foot hits the rock  
none	 sprains your ankle for a second it kind of folds to the side and you fall down to one knee ill  say with that your movements going to get you right there youre not in the circle currently  ashley all right then i will cast spirit guardians into the circle  matt okay  ashley and i will have them attack  matt okay spirit guardians here  travis i dont think weve seen that before  laura i know right i think shes done spirit guardians one other time  travis okay sorry  ashley its okay 
dung	  matt so youre designating them as the creature their speed is halved when the creature enters  the area or starts its turn there it has to make a wisdom save or take the damage right thats  how it works okay so that ends your turn pike as you cast the spell there you watch as a series  of small ghostly divinefocused creatures appear on the horizon of the circle all looming towards  this dark entity that ends your turn pike  ashley yes  matt all righty taryon  sam oh god all right i 
none	 whip out my string of beads and i pull off a bead and i will throw it  down at the creatures feet just behind it if possible so it and only it is  in the cube of ten feet  matt okay let me see here  liam whispers where does he get all these wonderful toys  sam money lots and lots of money  matt okay the bead hits the ground and detonates and you watch as theres a flash of  arcane energy in the sphere as it encompasses it doesnt seem to affect the 
none	 creature  sam so theres just a big spherical ball there with nothing inside of it or does the creature  look like its inside of it  matt it looks like its partway in and partway out and unaffected by the bead  sam holy shit  travis youre just losing money left and right  laura oh man  sam this is an expensive trip  laughter  sam well then i will do the heroic thing as my bonus action click my boots of speed and run  just sort of run behind that rock with the 
none	 gnomes and try to position  doty in between me and the beast  matt do you move doty forward  sam just between us not forward just in a guarding position  matt okay there you go so doty just tary all right so thats all doty does  is just get ready  sam he cant do a separate attack can he no  matt yeah he can  sam oh he can  matt he acts entirely different than you yeah  sam oh jeez im not used to having these things then yes ill just have

none	 points  matt four points all righty as you rush down and stab it in the back as the blade hits and  flashes with just the blast the creature groans and you carve down and it feels like  youre cutting through a cloud through air but you watch it separate around as the blade carves  down you come up with the second swipe this time hitting directly theres a flash of divine energy  as the burst goes off you watch the creature take the impact and separate slowly after where it hit  the clouds being 
none	 pushed back by like a slowmotion blast of the divine energy you pulse through  third strike and you swing past and you see it catch the edge of the side growls reacts to it  slowly but it seems to be having an effect  liam feathers feathers  matt feathers rest to the ground okay grog youre up  travis frenzied rage reckless great weapon master all up on him  matt all right go for it  travis all right  sam everything  liam whats the plan rush it  taliesin get her  matt that

none	 physicality in the world and  its beginning to shrink in size its still wailing and screaming in your face but the  impacts are making an effect  travis nice  matt that ends your turn grog the creature is now going to go ahead and swing in a wide circle  in its desperation its going to go ahead and cause this  marisha top of its turn  matt top of its turn yeah  marisha it takes 4d10 of damage  matt well it has to make a save all right so what it does is 
none	 the moonbeam hits down on it and  you watch as it seems to not really react to it like it burns a little bit and you see some kind  of sparkling white energy but its not reacting directly from it at the moment it seems to be  like generally trying to avoid it but its not seemingly taking any damage from it now its  going to go ahead and do a big sweeping strike to try and hit everything around it you watch as  these pseudopods begin to spin like a buzzsaw in the vicinity 
none	 whats your ac grog  travis advantage against me too  matt yeah thats right  travis 17 is my ac  matt misses you against trinket  travis with advantage it misses me  sam with advantage  matt yeah whats trinkets ac  laura oh 21  matt 21 misses against vax thats a natural one and against percy that is a whats your  ac  taliesin 18  matt that misses  travis and laura what  matt oh and against doty as well doty whats dotys ac  sam 12  matt misses  all

none	 a guiding bolt is that dependent on  matt you can be pretty accurate with a guiding bolt but guiding bolt is an action  ashley oh shit yeah fuck im gonna drop the mace on her foot  matt okay so this is less of an attack and more of dropping it on her foot as it hits well say  cause you dropped it on it she goes yelps and she picks her foot off pulling it out from  underneath and its shes wearing a light leather boot it hurt her toe pretty bad shes  like 
none	 sounds of pain and johanns like astra are you okay pike be careful hes kind of  helping her does that end your turn  ashley i guess so  matt all right taryon youre up  marisha so wait thats johann or whatshisname and his wife  laura yeah  marisha where the fuck is jb  laura theyre over by me  matt shes right there  sam are jb and ogden together  matt jb is over on like ten feet to your left ogdens just right next to you almost holding  onto your the back

none	 a minute and he goes screams and  just plummets off the side  taliesin i was technically right below it  laura thats true  taliesin im gonna make a grab  matt okay go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw  taliesin i was kind of prepared for this  liam im way up high and i say i dont know whats going on but it does not look good here  laughter  taliesin dex saving throw you know im going to reroll that  sam what you can just do that  taliesin im going 
none	 to use a resolve yeah its the exact same roll  matt what is it  taliesin dex saving roll its 11  matt whiff screams  liam wait in that second i can go 500 feet in six seconds so can i blast down towards the cliff  and dump her ten feet and keep going  travis thats going to be the most gnarly dropoff ever  matt not safely  liam safely  ashley shes gonna break some legs its okay  liam safely safely i will go whoosh and let her take a little damage and

none	 you dive down hes just like screams just tumbling down as he falls faster towards the  cliff rocks and you can just barely see the waves crashing from the moonlight thats hitting him as  youre just in a fullon raven dive towards it  liam bullet train baby  laura oh god  marisha can i take her and grasping vine and throw her into my entanglement and just keep all  of them entangled  matt grasping vine is a concentration spell youll lose the entanglement if you do it  laura thats okay im going to 
none	 use the rope of entanglement that i have and use it on her  matt and with that without even really much of a resistance from her shes tangled up in the rope  and falls on the ground on her side go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw  liam saving throw okay  matt actually for this in particular because its less of a reaction this is a make a  dexterity check this is just a plus your dexterity bonus  liam okay i have luck ive got one luck left 20  matt you reach 
none	 out once and grab a section of the cloth and it tears and he keeps plummeting you  watch as the stones below its a jagged base of the salted bluffs about ten feet before impact  as his screaming has stopped and you grab him and just whff right across the surface of the  water but inches his toes the tips of his feet skid across the surface of the water as you  whoosh and rocket him straight back up towards the top of the cliff its going to take you a  little while to get 
none	 up there now  liam sure  matt diving is one thing he is unconscious in your grasp  liam and the haste is gone by the time ive gone through all that  matt yeah so youre slowly flying your way back up you guys are bent over and you can see the  raven wings you cant quite see whether or not he got him but all you see is vax slowly making his  way back towards the top of the cliff  taliesin should we tell them if he survived or do you want to surprise 
none	 them i say loudly enough  for everybody to hear  ashley surprise them  laura how about you tell us  taliesin im pulling back up oh yeah hes fine  ashley im going to walk over to jb shes tangled  matt shes wrapped up in the rope and shes like breathing heavily  ashley im going to slowly start untangling her  matt hi pike  ashley hi jb for starters  matt im sorry im sorry  ashley okay thats fine im sorry i didnt spend more time with you but this is  unacceptable this 
none	 is not how you treat family and if anything i hope you learn from this what  do you want what do you want from me tell me and ill give it to you  matt i dont care about the money thats what they wanted honestly i just used this as an  excuse to get to see you again it would have been fine if no one had found out anything we would  have been heroes we would have had no reason to not be friends again we would have saved you as  far as you 
none	 know from a terrible curse and maybe that would have maybe then i would have been a  hero to you but im nothing im a caretaker to a swindler and move around too much to make any real  friends so thats just my lot in life i guess  ashley it doesnt have to be  matt thats all i know  ashley but youre very smart i think theres more for you in this life than you know  matt you can see now shes just tears now at this point  ashley im going to walk 
none	 over to johann and astra  matt okay yeah theyve let the invisibility down at this point theyre both just entangled  oh theres some sort of misunderstanding here we were under the impression that there was a  terrible curse  ashley money  matt no no we look look okay look we have been following  marisha i tighten the grasp on them  matt squeals weve been following that man because he is hes my dad and were really  broke and we blew through all the money you sent us very quickly i mean come on

none	 dont rush it dont rush it  ashley wheres ogden  matt you wait another few minutes its a long flight up at this point without the haste i mean  the winds do help a little bit because the winds are hitting the cliff and heading upwards so the  updraft does help a bit but it takes about five or six minutes or so for him to eventually get his  way back up to the top probably longer than that even then eventually you watch as vax returns and  drops an unconscious unmoving ogden onto the 
none	 rocky cliffside floor  liam old bugger looks so sweet when hes sleeping  ashley does he still have the diamond with him  matt funny thing when that orb disappeared and he fell so did him and the diamond  liam windmill  matt so he is not with the diamond the diamond is nowhere to be seen  laura thatll make someones day eventually  marisha it was more the principle of the matter  ashley well im sad  laura pike if you send them on their way think about jb thats all i ask  ashley
