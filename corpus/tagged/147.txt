delaying starting because were going to have to face that fact that  pike isnt with us as soon as we start  travis and scanlans still in the pooper hes not really  marisha yeah where is scanlan  liam

couldnt have worked out better  sam oh really  laura what is he wearing  travis asp hole what does it say where you what  sam its the asp hole  liam asp hole  sam its just a bar that i like to go to down at the asp hole  liam and i got shit for talking about bears today  matt no im pretty sure thats somewhere in emon  laughter  travis and well find it  sam yeah well /none/ find the asp hole  matt yeah so lets actually start this game guys thank you for being patient with our intro  here weve been gone for two weeks we have a lot to talk about so thank you for letting us get  that out so picking up where we left off the party completed the venture of taking the horn of  orcus to a place of safety and sealing it away hopefully for eternity with the help of lady  kima to the scalebearers after heading to the basement of the platinum sanctuary in the city /none/ of  vasselheim theyve succeeded to do so vasselheim which is a distant city to the far  northwest of the continent theyre used to this city is a very devout religionbased city and  currently considered the oldest bastion of civilization in the known civilized world after  taking a skyship across the ocean to get there sealing the horn you guys also discover upon  doing so that the ruins longforgotten ruins of what appears to be an ancient temple to sarenrae  were recently discovered while sarenrae does not have a strong following in this city the /none/ few that  are trying to raise it ask for pikes help to stay back and help build it and bring it to its former  glory hopefully to reestablish a basis of worship in this city and she decided to help  these folks the party then steps away from the ruins of the tower  sad but understanding of the circumstance  liam perhaps we could sit on a nearby rooftop and watch pike work  laura just for the next eight months  travis id be all right with that  marisha thats not creepy at all /town/  matt critical role all of a sudden becomes the greatest grasswatching game of all time as you  all stand there you have to decide your next course of action you stand in the muddy road  taking in the cold dusk air as the sun slowly sets to the west now this area of the city has a  vastly different feel than the platinum sanctuary in the haste to make it to the ruin youve passed  out of the section that seems to be under bahamuts watch and into a different area in this  area /town/ most of the buildings are reinforced with ruddy iron plates plumes of smoke rise up from a  handful of heavy smokestacks you can see over the rooftops in the distance toward the center of this  section what looks like a massive dark red statue of a muscular bearded man  liam the beauty of this game is i have no idea what the shit were going to do right now  sam so were standing outside the place where we just left pike  matt yeah the ruins of the tower  marisha so were essentially standing in /town/ the middle of a town being like now what  laura should we go look at that statue then  taliesin i want to see if theres an inscription  matt if youd like to  taliesin yes that would be lovely  sam while hes doing that scanlan is feeling still terribly sad about leaving pike so overcome  with emotion that he must step into the ruins one last time just to see the place where shes going  to be for the next several months years and before i do so i drink one of my potions /none/ that i  bought from whatshisbutt gilmore the glorious gilmore yes  matt all right  sam i dont know how it works but im going to drink it anyway  matt okay you drink it  sam okay i drink it i go inside the ruins and look around and touch some of the walls and look  at the stonework and everything i want to see where shes going to be so i know shes safe  overcome with a little bit of verklempt emotion i shed a single tear  matt as you quietly take this moment /none/ to yourself amongst the ruins you can hear the clattering of  stonework as the small band of sarenrae worshipers are now being helped by pike whos gathered them  into a plan as to how to remove and restore portions of the building that are currently  visible from the dirt and earth that its embedded in hearing her voice echo through the hallway  its a very comforting sense you feel a rumbling in your stomach  sam i feel uncomfortable it must be the emotion  matt its probably the emotion  sam i find a side /none/ chamber or a little nook somewhere where i can have some privacy  matt okay you find your way back towards the makeshift wooden plank stairway and there was a  small alcove not far from there within the earth wall that looks to be relatively private theres  little to no light and it does have a view of the current ruin  sam i say a little prayer and i take a big dump on the floor  travis laughing no you do not  sam well my stomach was rumbling  travis laughing youre in a temple /none/ man  laura pikes probably going to have to be the one to clean that up  sam sometimes it just affects me i have weak nerves and as im squatting i hum to myself  singing how do i say goodbye to what we almost had  orion this is not romantic at all you know that right  matt welcome back guys  marisha ive missed you guys so much  matt as you finish your business you step away from the alcove back to the stairway the contents  of the potion seem to have had some /none/ effect as the remnants of what you leave behind have a very soft  blue glowing hue to them  sam i left a magic dump  travis do we need to collect the dump  sam nope we should leave the dump  laura are you going to be able to see through the dump  travis hes covering his face i think we need the blue shit  marisha can you cast detect magic on the poo  sam its already magical poo  orion are we there were not there  laura were not there its just /none/ scanlan  orion okay so hes just shitting  laura hes just leaving it  sam so i leave and rejoin my fellows wiping the tear from my eye and the poo from my bottom  orion well i love you ashley i do  marisha this is what happens when we dont have any direction  travis but whats the purpose of the potion to make your poo blue  sam i took a potion that will let me see through my poo and check in on pike from time to time  laura will she realize you can /none/ see her through the poop  sam i certainly hope not  laura wouldnt that be great if she could just talk to you through the poo  liam why arent the priests going to shovel that shit up  sam as long as some of my cellular remains are there i might be able to see  a little bit into the room  liam whats cellular  sam laughs its poo  liam oh you mean little flakes of poo  matt for the sake of brevity in story progression here and to dissuade a 30minute conversation  /none/ about scanlans excrement after youve rejoined the party the sun is now set the cold air is  beginning to really sweep in through the streets the clouds overhead begin to slowly rumble and you  can hear distant thunder and you get the feeling due to the moisture in the air youre not too far  away from a rain  laura should we bunk for the night before we head out in the morning  taliesin i say we head to the ship  travis wasnt there a guy with a red beard we were supposed to go /dung/ see  laura i wanted to wander over to the statue while scanlan was dumping  sam i feel great right now by the way  taliesin finding some relief in the situation  orion damn it just when i was starting to like you gnome  liam moving on lets go take a look at this statue  matt chuckling all right  sam its magic poo  liam dont change scanlan  matt as you guys make your way through the center of this district  laura i feel like its dark now  matt yeah you get /town/ the sense that this area most of the people that live in this area are more  roughandtumble than the alreadyrough people who live in vasselheim from what youve  encountered the buildings themselves all seem to be reinforced with iron plates and it looks like  there is a very heavy trade in metalwork and a lot of the construction of anything metallic  appears to be coming through or from this portion of the town as you approach closer to this  statue its not just a statue you see it is actually sitting atop what looks to /none/ be a large  blocky fortresslike temple unlike the platinum sanctuary which is a very beautiful but simple  array this one has a crenellated top to each of these walled structures you can see braziers  blasting flame every 20 or so feet along the top of it you can see as you approach the front of  this there are two giant stone doorways with steps that look up to it and what looks to be two  gargantuan war horns that spiral along the sides and then open up outward towards the entire city  in front /none/ of it im going to ask you guys to make a religion check if you could  travis oh i got this  orion natural 20  taliesin yeah natural 20  taliesin and orion boom  orion thats so cool  travis natural four  taliesin because we know our shit  matt as you guys begin your approach even in the darkness you can see the figure this humanlike  man barrelchested massive muscles what looks almost like iron bracers around his wrists he is  carved or sculpted from solid iron or plates that have been put /none/ together from some sort of iron  initial structure the beard is long and goes to about midchest he carries in one hand this long  thick shortsword and has furs and leathers about his legs and midsection you recognize this to be  a very hefty depiction of the deity kord  laura sam and travis kord  travis i admire his beard  matt it is a beard worth admiring  marisha how might one spell kord  matt kord  marisha simple i like that  sam hes a god of some sort  matt he is /town/ indeed  taliesin tell us of this kord try to find your notes of this kord  laura hes a dwarven god  matt not dwarven  liam a man human  matt kord is essentially a deity of warfare combat and storms a god that has been  longworshipped by tribal cultures from long past that enjoyed the essence of battle  and challenge and combat  liam did you say storms tiberius war and combat and storms  orion storms yes storms and winds  matt and quickly the motif of this section of the town comes into /town/ play this you assume is the  portion of the city that is dedicated to the temple of kord  this being the structure before you  marisha does it seem to be a central theme across the whole town this town worships kord  matt no youve only really been to two sections the first one you were brought to was primarily  under the worship of bahamut the platinum dragon  marisha okay giggles  taliesin getting the giggles out  travis did you look at it did you use your fancy eyes to look at it  /none/ taliesin well my question is is this a temple if it is a temple to kord is this a place of  battle is this somewhere where people go watch battles and fighting  matt from the exterior and it is a closedoff temple it looks like a large blocky obstinate  fortress that is nearly impenetrable from the way its constructed and reinforced you dont know  whats inside of it  liam theres a big gate or door at the front  matt two large iron doors about 20 feet tall that are currently shut its about five /dung/ or six steps  getting up to it  laura and its nighttime  matt it is nighttime currently yes  liam are there any citizens out right now or are we alone in the dark  matt as it has gotten to dusk its thinned out a little bit but there are a few individuals  walking by carrying pickaxes over one shoulder and passing by  liam id like to walk over to the nearest one and ask  sam to who  liam to a passerby  matt the two gentlemen ones in his mid20s the one /none/ that turns to you initially probably looks a  little older than that late 30s grizzled shaven but the fiveoclock shadow has definitely kicked  in longer tousled hair dirt on the face simple clothing pickaxe over his shoulder and what looks  like a leather belt that carries other tools  sam these are dwarves  matt these are human yes i heard you calling  liam excuse me good sir my friend over here the dragonborn he seems to think that this is  some sort of temple or edifice to the god kord i just want to /none/ know is he correct  matt is this your first time in the braving grounds  orion in dwarvish i say  sam theyre not dwarves  matt you can still say it though  laughter  liam yes absolutely this is our first time we literally just rolled into vasselheim what can  you tell us of this its an impressive structure  matt the younger gentleman next to him similarly dressed begins to speak up he puts his hand up  and goes the braving grounds is the area of this city that is built around the worship /none/ of the great  god kord his protection and strength he bestows upon those who live for the sake of challenge to  prove oneself better with each passing day that is the basis of the braving grounds  laura so its like a battleground  matt its a community that when called to battle can definitely defend itself  what you see before you he looks up at  the giant structure this  is called the trial forge it is the oldest known  temple to kord and has been built and rebuilt for  many many hundreds /town/ of years  orion chuckles hence forge right  liam and does one need to be a priest or cleric of this faith to challenge oneself  or can anyone  travis worship  matt anyone is able to worship what deity they wish in this town we have an understanding if  youre looking for a tussle what youre looking for is the crucible  travis yes what else can you tell us about this crucible  matt the crucible is a fighting pit i mean there is a sacred arena within the temple but  thats reserved for /tavern/ very very special occasions if youre looking to just get your fight on and  punch someone in the face the crucible is what youre looking for he spits off to the side and  points a little ways down the roadway  marisha i think grog wants to go  matt beyond that way youll see a tavern known as the bellows respite  sam bellows respite  matt one of the finer inns youll find in the braving grounds proper but i take it if you walk  that direction youll see the crucible before too long  /none/ laura have you ever fought in the crucible  matt me no too busy too many people better fighters than me in there  ill just stick to the mines  marisha are these battles to the death  matt nah these are battles of honor death belongs in a true war mind you there have been  some folks unfortunately who may have fallen to a hit on the head too hard and thats  understandable but the purpose of kord is not necessarily to smite your foes unless theyve  given you damn good reason other than that /none/ contest of strength is how we live  orion a friendly sparring match is what were about  liam thats this neighborhood of vasselheim not the city as a whole just in these parts  matt for the most part i mean we have members of our community that are bastions and guard the  whole city but we tend to keep our own  offscreen crash  matt pardon my friend hes clumsy and the other gentleman  picks up his tools and is like sorry  travis have you been to this crucible often and if so is /none/ there a champion or a favorite that  youve seen or know of  matt we have some people come in and out probably best to ask around the crucible to be  honest ive seen some people take some serious beatings down there i havent kept much attention  to it i havent the money to sling around it  laura the money wait it costs money  matt what you think theres going to be fights in a pit and no ones betting on it welcome to  vasselheim my dear  travis were going to be rich /town/  orion what if there are two people fighting the town does not know  matt i dont know take it up at the crucible  travis how far is the crucible from here  matt keep walking youll see it  laura keep walking thank you friend  matt my pleasure kords strength to you and he keeps on walking  travis kords strength  sam kords strength to you  matt no core strength  laura situps crunches  travis core strength to you namaste  matt you guys walk beyond the trial forge back towards the path /town/ where you came off to the side on  the left and you can see most of the buildings their internal lighting is very low you can see  most folks either go to bed at this evening or at least keep a very low visual profile from their  abodes however lights are blazing from the interior of this threestory inn the bellows  respite is definitely a rowdy place you can hear already the shouts and music streaming from the  interior of it you gather that while there are a lot of people inside you can see /tavern/ at the windows  and openings to the inside of the tavern there is a large group gathered in the middle of the  thoroughfare just outside of it looks like a circle of individuals that are all shouting and  screaming over each other big fistpumps to the air some folks are angrily throwing their coin  purses to the ground  travis like a kid getting too close to an amusement park i take off running  matt grog starts running up bounding up the way you can see the actual  marisha grog grog not too far /none/ ahead  travis okay  liam i dont start running but im following behind him and i take out my keen dagger and just  start sort of dancing it across my hand as i follow after him  matt david bowie and the glass orb  liam yes exactly  orion is there a registry or something like that  matt actually as you approach you can see there is no registry there is quite literally a pit in  the ground its a 15 20foot dip it is a carvedout pit maybe no more than id say 25 /town/ 30  feet across and there is no ladder there is no step going down theres just two people in there  beating the everliving crap out of each other and a crowd of people gathering around you do see  what looks to be two very welldressed gentlemen that are in the process of collecting and paying  out and you approach just as the final hit takes to this gentlemans jaw this tattooed individual  you can see bloodied in the face nose broken teeth knocked out this poor poor human fellow  gets knocked clean onto the /town/ ground you can see standing over his body this extremely built  aggressive looks like another human female with her hair pulled back in a very tight ponytail just  spits on his body turns around and wipes the blood from the front of her face snaps her  fingers and you can see folks bring a ladder and lean it over the side and she climbs up the ladder  as everyone cheers on her way up  marisha before we get up to the crowd i transform into minxie im going minxie and i  catch up to /town/ grog going minxie  travis oh they dont like magic  marisha did they see me im trying to do it stealthily before it happens  matt you can make a stealth check if you like you do know through the discussions that its  arcane magic that seems to be the shunned element in this town as it is a town of worship divine  magic for the most part seems okay  marisha everyone saw me its fine  matt everyone wouldve seen you if they werent currently enraptured by the chaos those who did  notice probably /town/ didnt seem to care much other than a giant tiger now walks up to them  travis can i grab the nearest person near me turn whoevers shoulder that is and go  who is she  matt as you pull the shoulder around you can see a rather portly human fellow balding on top with  long benjamin franklinlooking hair very nice robes turns  are you new to this town then is it  travis yeah very new  matt thats the siren the siren  orion i approach and saunter next to grog  travis the siren /none/  matt shes the one you bet on trust me on that as he walks over to you can see another  one of these gentlemen very welldressed hair slicked back tall thin human in very very fine  purple robes collects some peoples money begins giving out a few things pulls out a notebook with  a little charter hes in the middle of putting notes in  laura hello how would we enter a new fighter into this pit  matt well actually that was the last fighter scheduled for the evening  travis be a pity not /town/ to have one more  matt you wish to fight  travis wish its more like an itch a need  matt he puts his arm out and the crowd steps back a bit and he takes a good long headtotoe  upanddown look at you walks around from side to side inspecting you he gets a little bit close  and reaches out not even asking he starts grabbing the side of your arms  marisha i start growling a little bit  travis oh yeah watch out  matt calm down kitty calm down steps back well its /dung/ not too late what caliber of fighter  do you consider yourself  travis caliber  matt who do you want to fight  sam who are the options  orion could he fight anyone  travis this is my friend scanlan  sam im more of his manager than his friend actually hi im scanlan  matt pleasure  sam pleasures all mine my brute over here who can he battle what are his options  matt this late in the evening  liam ill fight him  sam excuse me  liam i said ill fight him  /none/ matt i apologize if youre going to have someone enter the arena worth betting on they  have to go up against one of our proven fighters first however once your friend here gets his  face beaten in youre more than welcome to join him in the ring thereafter  travis i havent laughed so hard in my entire life face beaten he says face beaten  matt youre mighty confident arent you  travis its my middle i only have one name  laughter  travis if i did  sam it would be that  travis yeah /none/  matt well first and foremost all bets begin at 100 gold pieces  laura 100 gold is that all  matt you can increase the bet if youd like  laura id love to  matt what would you like to bet  laura 500 gold on this one right here  matt is she the only one betting  sam she bets for all of us  liam ill put a thousand down right now that i can beat the big guy  sam you mean grog  liam of my own money yes  laura you cant /none/ fight him yet  liam i cant rules are meant to be bent and stretched am i right  matt youre going to put your money down between your friends to fight your friends  liam its a contentious relationship  matt his eyes have already wandered from your face he says 500 gold on the goliath do we  hear anything else a few other individuals step up and start telling him like 50 gold down  its a hundredgold minimum  100 gold  sam who is he fighting  travis we dont know yet  sam we /none/ have to bet before we see the meat  matt unproven fighters with a grandiose sense of selfability enjoy the surprise  taliesin so what sort of odds are we talking about then  matt for this one based on your height reach strength and arrogance  id put you at fourtoone against  laura fourtoone  travis okay  orion its okay grog he doesnt know that youve beaten up a lot of people  sam dont tell him  orion oh right  travis ive got this scar here how does he think i got it  sam /none/ those are fair odds well take that  matt all right 500 gold is this all im hearing  travis a hundred of my own gold on me  matt 600 gold  taliesin hold on  sam ill bet 50 gold against him we have to hedge  matt 100 gold is the minimum bet  sam well then i cant afford it im sorry we have to hedge  laura youre going to get it grog youre going to do it i have faith in you  orion ill put 500 gold on the goliath  laura oh /none/ my god were going to lose all our money on grog no were not  matt all right last bets last bets everyone starts putting in their cash a couple folks  frenzy over you see a couple guys  liam i put a thousand on the goliath  sam what  liam 1000 gold on the goliath  laura sing a song do you use

the destroyer  travis phillip  laughter  orion no thats like the opposite of what i said  matt phillip the newcomer has decided to hedge his and his friends savings that he upon what i  can only imagine is his first arrival into vasselheim to get his face pummeled by our  current standing champion kern the hammer  at this point the crowd immediately goes quiet and whispering you can see a few individuals now  walking over ushering this /none/ man looks like he just stepped out of the nearby mines hes got  coal dirt on his face when i say man it is a sixfootsix very visibly halforc gentleman  built like some sort of thickass building youve walked past coming through here bald head big  bristly mustache and a face thats obviously taken a beating over the years he walks up  nonchalantly just wearing a simple tattered tunic leather pants and boots you can see him  like cracking his fingers he looks over to the side at one of the guys they better have /none/ pulled  me out of work for a good reason who am i up against  travis i envy your facial hair  matt i envy your currently unbroken face currently  travis im going to kill him thats a rule right im not supposed to kill him  laura youre not supposed to kill him no killing allowed in this  matt the bookie steps forward no killing fighting until one falls  travis what happens if they start to cry  matt then you keep punching  travis i like it  matt no weapons no armor fists /none/ against fists until one of them falls lower the ladder as  they put the ladder down into the arena you can see the orc gentleman pulls out a small enclosed  almost like a wineskin like an iron wineskin unscrews it and drinks it all down  travis kern the shithead does  matt yeah puts it down throws it to the ground with a tingtingting  laura wait what was in that was that wine  matt it is customary to drink before a fight  travis can i have my cask of ale real fast  laura /tavern/ wait does anybody have a potion of stoneskin or anything good  matt as everyone gathers around you can now see people are coming back out of the tavern to gather  around the outskirts of the crucible grog gets lowered down the ladder  sam oh hes already down  matt well grog what else do you want to do before you prepare  travis what do i want to do to prepare  matt well if you havent gone down yet the other guy has come down the ladder  travis i took a drink from the cask /none/ of ale  sam wait i come over to grog and i just look in his eyes and i say listen youve got this i  cant give you anything else but youve got this man and i also very quickly take out my potion of  fire giant strength and i slip it to him before he takes a drink of his ale  i dont know if i hand it to him  matt make a stealth check  sam okay squeaks nope  matt what did you roll  sam oh thats a six so eight  /none/ matt all right as you walk towards him and begin looking in his eyes as you begin to pull out the  flask a hand grasps your wrist and you glance over and you can see one of the burly human  gentlemen that escorted kern the hammer in is currently grasping your arm and says im  watching you one more try and ill throw you in there well go down ourselves  sam its for my asthma i promise  matt shoves you back away still clutching it looks to you grog up into your eyes you going /none/  to climb down and fight or you going to be a pussy about it  travis thats a really good question i would like to rage and i jump in the fucking pit  matt you leap over the side completely avoiding the ladder both feet hitting the ground with a  heavy thud sound the packed dust kicks up around your feet  sam come on phillip kick his ass  matt at which point the other orcs finished cracking his knuckles just kind of wipes the spit  off the edge of his chin gives you a /none/ look growls and you see a bit of foam toss from the  side of his mouth  liam nobody fucks with phil  laura i can smell you from here kern  matt go ahead and roll initiative  travis 20  matt 20 all righty  orion oh shit you got a 20  matt all right you actually probably wouldve landed there from the run  first round starts youre up  travis i would like to cast intimidating presence on fern the fucknut  matt kern but its better if grog gets it wrong  travis /none/ he never gets it right phillip thank you  matt phillip all right so use your action to use intimidating presence all right so whats  the dc on that  travis saving throw 13  matt 13 that will unfortunately not succeed as you glare at him with an angry phillip glare your  bellow echoing through the bottom of this crucible which in itself forms a very interesting  acoustic amplifying of your yell you can see kern on the other side is looking at you with the same  intense burning rage  sam wait thats your /none/ whole move  matt and you can move if you like  travis ill let him come to me  matt okay all right so as you stand there waiting with fists at your side kern takes his  turn you can see he begins to circle a little bit around you as he begins to spiral about with an  unnerving speed dashes forward fists come swinging one two both strikes coming towards  you that is a 19  travis misses  matt this is all fisticuffs that is a 24  travis that hits  matt and /none/ as a bonus action using his rage a third attack that is a 21  travis that definitely hits  matt all righty  liam would you like to use my spiky die  sam dont do it you got this phillip  matt the first one does eight points of damage the second one does seven points of damage as one  fist clips you across the chin the other one goes right into your abdominals youre still tensing  and you feel the impact but you just take the sheer weight of the force and flex and angrily /none/  stare him down in return  sam phillip do that thing where you move your pecs up and down  laughter  matt thats going to be a gif and as you now see kern prepares for a second bout its your turn  grog what are you doing  travis i would like to go into a frenzied rage i would like to start with a giant frontkick  forward and then hammer him down  matt all right go for the first strike  travis shit that misses two  matt thats probably going to miss  /none/ travis yep thats a 19  matt 19 is going to hit  travis and also 19  matt both hit yep so you go to kick with the front kick and he dodges to the side however  you still using your giant haymaker the inertia clips him across the face  go ahead and roll damage  travis that is a 16  matt youre not fighting with your axe this is with your fists  so rolling 1d4 and then half that  sam half that  matt yeah  laura you only get half damage of /none/ a d4  matt yep but you still add your strength modifier  liam so these guys both potentially have like a hundred hit points  travis six it was four and then half of that is two plus my modifier which is four so six  matt correct so six damage all righty  travis and then four  matt all righty  travis this is what i use for my fists i got bigass fists i got tattoos and shit on them i  never shower they fucking stink  taliesin you could do more damage if you /none/ hit him with the die because its sharp so youd  actually get more damage with the d4  matt all right so your modifier is plus its plus three for the modifier  travis no my modifiers plus four  matt okay and then what did you roll on that  travis two minus two  matt two then five total  travis oh five yeah  matt there you go all righty cool so you hit him across the face and you hit him to the other  side he comes back aligns his chin and you can /none/ see hes now stooping in for some sort of an  uppercut as he slips to the side a little bit with a sidestep that will be a 25 a 20 and a one so  whats your ac  travis 20  matt all right so both the first two hit as he comes low for a fullon uppercut hitting you for  that would be six points of damage whack under the chin as youre currently reeling from the  impact he crouches down and is going to go for a knee to the middle of your groin /none/ that is another  six points of damage whack right in the phillip junk you instinctively give out a grunts from  the impact after that point he comes up and it looks like he tries to go for some sort of a  piledrive grapple and you instinctively kick off of him and his third attack is completely wasted  its now your go  travis no one fucks with phillip jr i would like to bull rush and try and tackle him and if it  succeeds id like to headbutt him on the ground  matt okay /none/ okay its an action to do that so you can use your bonus action to attempt  travis and i would only get two attacks right  matt you only get one with this technically its an action to grapple  travis okay  sam do it  travis all right  matt so go ahead and roll an athletics check  travis no thats even better 22  matt 22 yeah you slam into him knock him to the ground and youre now on top of him hes  currently considered grappled and you can go ahead and attempt /none/ your headbutt  travis say hi boosh thats a lot 24  matt 24 yeah definitely so go ahead and roll damage on the same 1d4  travis 1d4 its my head  matt yep  sam your head is so puny  travis its got tattoos on it one and a half oh one and a half plus my strength right  matt so if its three or four its considered two so six all right so as you tackle him to  the ground and hes trying to pull you off you reach up wham just slam your /none/ forehead directly  into the center of his face as you pull back you can already see the blood streak off the front  of your head as his nose is smushed even further into his gnarled facade as you pull back instead  of pain hes laughing laughs as it comes to his turn hes not attempting to break grapple  hes going to reach up and grab you and attempt to headbutt you in return  travis i like it  matt thats going to be a 21 a 23 and a 19 all right thats a six /none/ seven damage so total of 13  damage as he reaches up and slams you slams you again and as you start backing up he goes to  slam you a third time and you catch his head in the middle of your mitt and hes now facetoface  with you just like snarls you guys are both snarling at each other like two rabid beasts  its your go  travis i would like to keep his head right where i have it and take my elbow and drive it down into  the bridge of his nose so /none/ thats 25  matt 25 hits  travis 22  matt hits  travis and 17  matt 17 does miss all right so go ahead and roll damage for the next two strikes  travis with this thing again six  matt six all righty  travis its hard to get above a six and six  matt six nice so as you hold him down his face wham head goes cracks against the ground  of the crucible as he starts picking his head up again you drill back again wham hit him a  second time this /none/ time you can see now his nose was already busted before now its nearly  concave its like he didnt have a nose before and theres just a bloody void where it once was  hes still smiling in a weird twisted way he seems to be enjoying this almost as much as you  you go down for the third one and this time he reaches up and grabs your elbow hes going to  take his turn to attempt to break your grapple as his action go ahead and roll either an athletics  or an acrobatics check /none/  travis 12  matt 12 all right he kicks you up back onto your feet and as he does he kipups onto his  feet as well looks at you with a smile wipes the snot and blood from the front of his face  licks it off his hand and with that same hand he rears back almost like hes winding up for a  punch and then just kicks you right in the center of your stomach  travis i like the feint i like the feint  matt thats 22 yeah thatll hit that is eight /none/ points of damage  orion hes fucking strong  laura you suck korn  matt that ends his turn now youre up grog youre both now standing facetoface again youre  reeling from the kick to the breadbasket  travis you hit me

nice whack whack you first jumped hit him in the face as he stumbles backward use the  inertia to slam him again with the /none/ same fist in the face and then turn around with a fullon  haymaker to the side of the temple whack as you can see theres a spray of blood and spittle  across the you guys are starting to push towards the back wall of the crucible and he actually  staggers back a little bit towards the wall from the impact cackles and he charges towards you  putting his head right towards the stomach that he kicked before going for that same soft spot hes  opened for himself thats going to be a 20 yeah that /none/ hits 21 and 21 comes in slams you into  the middle of your abdomen for seven damage  sam should i sing  matt eight damage and then an additional seven so thatd be 15 22 points of damage as he slams  his head into your midsection picks you up over his head slams you onto the ground and as youre  on the ground he runs up and soccerball kicks you in the side of your ribs just whack you  hear a crack as the impact hits and you can feel that surging shooting burning pain /none/ begin to fill  the side of your torso its your go  travis what else do i have what can i do  laura you can throw some dirt in his face  sam from the stands i turn to a portly gentleman next to me and i say sir do you see what that  fucking little elf said about your mother he called her a name i cant even repeat  im so sorry  matt go ahead and make a deception check  laura was he pointing at you  sam yes  laura oh god /none/  sam 18  matt he looks down at you and looks over at the elf and he says ill deal with him after the  fight ive got too much money on this right now  liam what an asphole  travis i roll up off of my side and i start to go oh i dont know it might be too much and

26  matt 26 make a dexterity save on his end no that wont work so you throw the dirt up as hes  rushing towards you to follow up on the attack the dirt goes streaming into his eyes and for a  second he stumbles and starts trying to wipe his face as he does he has the blood on his hands thats  also getting in his eyes the bloods starting to cake up a bit and hes just reaching out in the  area so /none/ thats your first attack  travis because i feel like we have a kinship i take my foot and i throw it right up into his  grundle just soccerkick the shit out of his nuts  laughter  matt go ahead and roll an attack you have advantage on this currently because he cant see  it coming  travis thats even better 25  matt 25 go ahead and roll damage  travis oh no i only have two right ten  laura how

reach out swiping a  backfist into open air you rush up and whack hit him with sheer force that you hear a unanimous  groans in the crowd all around echo down his knees immediately bend in towards each other and  you can see the sound escape instinctively from him its like wheezes as you reel for your  second strike which is going to be /none/ whats the second one you do  travis well did he drop to his knees  matt no hes still standing but barely  travis oh really yeah same place  matt you pull back and whack a second time in the same spot this sending him onto the ground  from behind he is currently prone okay thats rough  travis literally trying to see him cough a testicle  laughter  matt well regardless of what happens theres going to be a search  laughter  matt youre going to need a scouting party to find where one /none/ of them went so at the top of his  turn gets up and wipes dirt crust from his eyes reeling from the impact uses half his movement to  get up and staggers toward you as youre just welcoming it looks up at you for a second and  says you shouldnt have done that tall guy at which point he goes and lunges for your  midsection a second time misses with that strike as you dodge out of the way he spins around and  attempts to backkick you to the torso that will hit a 26 /none/ and that one is going to thats going  to be six points of damage to you from the backkick and as his foot comes down hes still  reaching for his groin from the sheer pain he just rushes forward and attempts to bite into your  shoulder thats going to be a 20  travis he rolled a 20  matt not a natural 20 just a total of 20 hes rolled a lot of 20s thats going to be seven  damage as he sinks his teeth into the side of your shoulder and neck area and /none/ tears a chunk of your  flesh out of the sides of his mouth now in the muscle so you reel back in pain and youre both  clutched in this gladiatorial grip its your go  travis oh amazing since were clutched in that grip ill

into an attack reach  forward and bite into the front of his face you dont get any nose but you do catch the top of  his lip as you pull back with a snapping sound part of his upper lip just comes off in your  mouth how much damage does that do  marisha its /none/ a souvenir  travis the first one is six  matt six damage all right whats your followup attack  travis would you say that he reaches back

down the front of his face and his throat you clip him right in the  center of his throat you hear the coughing sound as he with his other hand reaches up and grabs  his throat you can now see his front teeth visible through the lip thats no longer there  and whats your third strike  travis would you say that he bends forward then because hes grabbing his throat like that  matt hes tough hes bending forward but hes not completely incapacitated /none/ hes in pain  travis right i would say i go up next to him and invoke a fabled hero that i heard about in the  woods named macho man randy savage and i doubletap my elbow and drive it down  on top of his head  matt laughs all right go ahead and roll damage on this one  travis thank you six  matt six so as you leap up using the goliath weight coming down you doubletap the elbow and  you bring it down on top of his head he from the sheer force /none/ of it wham slams down facefirst  into the dirt just like that onto the ground as hes

sweep your legs out from under you go ahead and make this would be an acrobatics no  well make this a dexterity saving throw why not  travis ten  matt ten whoosh pulls your legs out from under you

currently on the ground with him on top of you youre both looking pretty rough  where are you at hit pointwise  travis i say tastes like home and i spit in his face and reach up and  thunderclap both of his ears  matt laughs all right go ahead and roll for attack  travis 24  matt hits  travis 17  matt 17 does not hit  travis 22  matt 22 does /none/ hit so you reach up go ahead and roll damage

are you doing for /none/ that one  travis he pulled away from my wrists and ill give him a little of the same put my fists  together and just swing straight down into his solar plexus since hes sitting on top of me  matt roll damage  travis thats a five  matt five wham you hit and you hear the wind out of him from the impact wheezes and hes  trying to get the wind back  travis i cant hear you what  matt he pushes off of your chest to stand up for a second and gasps gets /none/ one big inhale of air  and as he does he reaches up his leg and then tries to curbstomp kick you right in the stomach  while youre still on the ground that will be 18  travis misses  matt all right a 19  travis misses  matt and that will be a 24  travis you son of a bitch  matt all right so he goes to kick you once and you dodge out of the way kick a second time this  time you catch the foot and hold it in place he then /none/ lifts up with his other foot to a point where  now youre holding him in the air as he puts all of his weight in the air he comes down and slams  his elbow right into the center of your chest in the way you did to his head earlier thats going  to be for a total of eight points of damage  travis okay  liam i take the flagon of ale that ive been drinking all this time i slam it down on the  ground and push my sister out of the way and /none/ yell at the top of my lungs grog

forward with both of my thumbs and shove them into his  fucking eye sockets  matt roll an attack  travis fuck  laura oh no you distracted him  travis 12 thats better 22  matt okay so as you reach up to try to get his eyes he /none/ grasps your hands and instead begins  pulling back on the wrists you can feel the tension of the bone beginning to bend from the  sheer strength and force of it as you pull back your arms you attempt to headbutt him again and  he dodges his head out of the way and he knows he has you at an advantageous position what do you  want the third attack to be  travis hes still on top of me isnt he  matt yeah where are you at hit pointwise by the way  travis 18  /none/ matt hes looking pretty rough too so what do you want the third attack to be  travis would you say hes on my chest  matt hes currently on your chest and waist area right now like grunts holding you down  travis i was going to grapple him but if hes on my chest ill use my thighs to shove him up  towards the upper part of my body and ill drive down my elbow at the same time into that whole  bloody target area  matt laughs okay as you shift upward you bring your /none/ elbow forward roll for attack  sam no he rolled three already  matt oh thats right  travis i got at least a six  matt so six damage okay as you position him up whack the elbow hits and you can feel it sink  in what bones are there are mostly splintered and broken and you get a good inch into his face with  your elbow as you pull back hes looking really rough and one of his eyes is beginning to swell  entirely shut  travis we look like a rocky movie right now /none/  matt yeah this is a fullon dragout fight  travis i must break you  matt he angrily looks down at you snarls and he reaches both of his hands up again in a giant  hammer fashion thats going to be a 17  travis misses  matt a 20  travis hits  matt and a 15  travis misses  matt so he brings it down wham as it hits you manage to take the brunt of it in the shoulder  the second hit comes down and slams you for eight points of damage wham /none/ this one you can feel  the sternum crack as he brings up his fists a third time attempting to end this you use the  leverage you had when you pushed him up to actually spring your entire body upward and force  him off you he manages to get to his feet and you just get up and you both are bleeding from all  over your faces with giant bruises and both of you are barely holding yourselves up breathing  heavily its your go  travis im going to rush at him spit on my knuckles /none/ swing back and at the last second take  my right foot and drive it right through his kneecap  matt roll for attack  travis fuck you yes 24  matt 24 hits  travis 22  matt 22  travis 19  matt 19 just barely hits  cheering  matt all right so as you run forward bring the leg up whack you hit the side of the knee  roll damage  sam come on roll good  travis five six six  matt all right and what are the attacks you do  travis i /none/ want to drive my foot through his kneecap  matt it snaps hes still standing on the other leg but the knee is cracked behind  travis oh thats amazing ill just put my foot through his other knee  matt as you jump off the other one whack it catches the knee it doesnt snap but you can see  there is a bend to it and then he falls to the ground on both of his busted knees now looking  up at you and with the third strike what are you going to do  travis i /none/ would like to grab his head since hes probably kneeling on the ground at this point  right and say theres only room for one to rage in this pit and i take it and i just smash into  the top of his jaw hopefully dislocating the bloody lipless face that i see  matt okay  travis wait is he an orc  matt hes a halforc  travis as a halforc does he got those big teeth  matt there are little tusks there yeah  travis ill grab onto those  matt theyre small to pull /none/ you slam down on his face crunch you can see the jaw crack open the  tongue instinctively moves around a little but the jaw is definitely broken from the impact  sam its like a dance its like a beautiful dance  matt you can see that blow should have taken him out because there was nothing left  travis hes like the black knight in monty python hes got no knees  matt his body goes limp for a brief second you can see the halforc rage kicks in that  halforcs blood you can see him now /none/ rally up for one final round of vengeance against you grog  reaches up and grabs you by the throat and brings you up to slam into his head this is going to be  a 21 a 17  sam miss  matt and a 22 so grabs you slams into your head with the first strike that is going to be six  points of damage boom into the face you can feel like the shock the white light in your eyes  as the impact smashes into you he goes to do it a second time this /none/ time you instinctively reach  down with your hands and push his face away you can feel the fading just from the sheer impact as  he pushes you up onto your feet again and you step back and he takes a moment to look at you with  his missing lip his bashedin nose eye swollen shut both knees messed up pants respect and  then he runs forward and with one heaping haymaker just takes you in the face with a cracking sound  for six points of damage  groaning  matt with a resounding crack grogs /town/ head spins his body turning he stumbles a couple of steps  falls to one knee facedown in the dirt unconscious the whole crowd raises and cheers  cheering as the mostly broken halforc raises one of its fists to the air walks around looks  over to your body reaches into his pocket and flicks a gold coin onto your back walks over to  the ladder and begins very painfully making his way up to the edge of the crucible  laura yeah hes only using his arms because hes got no knees douche  matt getting up /town/ to the top the crowd cheers you can now see one of the bookies reveals a holy  symbol one that you recognize as the symbol of kord and he goes down and immediately begins  administering healing to our recently unconscious grog you can see the other bookie who is dressed  similarly in the purplish robes you saw before also begins to heal our good fighting halforc  friend as he lumps over and takes his sack of coins from him the clerics of kord are the ones  actually running this it looks like you come to /none/ in the pit grog beaten wearied and fatigued  because of your frenzied rage however you have been defeated in the crucible  laura that was painful  matt that was so close  sam i go down and nurse him nurse his head hold him and just tell him grog you won  you did it buddy  matt make a deception roll  sam 16  matt i would say given the circumstances its nice that hes trying but its been a while since  youve been bested in oneonone combat and a part of you is deeply /none/ hurt by it but at the same  time there is that burning fire that need to come back and vengefully tear him down from his  precipice when youre ready  travis i say nothing  orion its okay buddy this isnt the first time youve been knocked unconscious  laura its too bad pike didnt cast death ward on him before she left though  that wouldve been great  marisha i go up and rub on him and meows  matt as youre being tended to by your party the same bookie that brought you in comes /none/ over and  taps you on the shoulder and says not going to lie no one has taken a beating from the hammer  like that and brought him so close i dont think hes going to be able to take another round with  you for at least a few days but youre welcome to fight in my ring any time you wish  laura well need to earn our money back  matt there is that yes  orion or you could just give it to us  travis i walk away  laura is there a whorehouse /none/ here in vasselheim  orion youre asking this question  matt a curious laugh comes across the bookies face and he says  the third floor of the bellows  what did i call it again  sam the bellows respite  matt the bellows respite sorry i was in the moment the third floor of the bellows respite  does itself run as a brothel if thats what youre inquiring  laura that is what i was inquiring  taliesin come on grog well get you ice cream  laura well get you ice cream grog and a whore /tavern/ hows that sound  liam coldstone  orion grog you can

turns to you a human  fellow whos /tavern/ missing one eye has a tufted spotty beard and happily extends a large tankard of ale  and says on the house for you friend you fought well tonight  travis i

agreed to dress up as pengulord  tomorrow all day if we reach this goal and for those who dont know there was a very large war  this morning in team no stream the chatroom while we were offline /none/ someone thought it would be  funny to put my face on a penguin i did not think it was funny and i timed out and banned every  single person that referenced it and exalted all of my power as overlord so it pains me to agree  to do this very much so because it completely diminishes everything ive strived so hard for in  world domination penguins are the leastthreatening animals on the planet  and i despise them  matt wow that is an intensity pengulord guys  zac good for you guys  matt pengulord /none/ i like the sound of that  marisha they like to snuggle  zac well good for them no  matt we

group grog is often consulted for his vast knowledge of shapes  colors and chuckle shiny things  also ale  in his early years armed with his twohanded great axe grog often enjoyed proving his might  amongst the ranks of /none/ his familys wandering herd but after coming upon an unsuspecting elderly  gnome in the woods he objected to the killing of such an innocent life a creature of impulse grog  felt only pity for this well this terrified little thing  and his disobedience cost him dearly  beaten bloody and banished by the herd leader his uncle kevdak grog was abandoned and left to die  exiled from his herd it was then that the relative of the very gnome he fought to save  saved him it was the kindness of a gnome cleric named pike /none/ that healed grog bringing him back  from deaths edge and they have remained close friends ever since  most nights grog can be found challenging entire taverns to wrestling matches ha or accompanying  scanlan to the nearest house where you pay for lady favors  also ale  marisha a first impression of keyleth would leave you with little information on the halfelven  druid you might even think that her social awkwardness due to her sheltered upbringing is  kind of sweet chuckle  of course it would be unwise to underestimate her based on first impressions /none/ thunder under that  unintimidating petite frame is a vicious beast

love of nature and  the elemental magics it is her peoples inherent duty to protect the delicate areas in taldorei  where the four elemental planes begin to bleed with this realm  since she was a little girl she had quite a knack for air manipulation and beast shaping abilities /none/  well if you consider kittens and flying squirrels to be little beasts which i do clears throat  anyways it wasnt long before the headmaster of the tribe her father korren realized her true  prodigious abilities and she was inveterated to succeed him as the next headmaster  just like that her jovial childhood was stripped and replaced with endless spell memorization  teachings from ancient traditions and exceedingly high expectations every druid leader to be must  embark on a journey to seek out the sister tribes in order to introduce and establish respect amongst  the /none/ fellow headmasters they call this the aramente or noble odyssey when her father felt  she was ready he set her on the path to truly discovering herself not knowing when or if she  will ever return  as she hiked down the mountain towards stillben she meditated on the task ahead part of the  aramente is proving yourself a strong warrior a valiant protector and a wise and compassionate  leader with this knowledge one thought plays on repeat in her mind is she even worthy  taliesin percy was the third of seven children born to /dung/ a noble family who lived far to the north  in the ancient castle of whitestone with so many siblings to share the burdens of lordship percy  turned his attentions to the sciences engineering and naturalism  one day a mysterious couple named lord and lady briarwood came to court during a feast held in  their honor the briarwoods violently took control of the castle killing or imprisoning everyone who  would stand in their way  percy awoke chained in the dungeon only to be freed by his younger sister together they fled  chased by the /none/ briarwoods men as they ran percys sister took several arrows to the chest  and fell percy kept running eventually jumping into a freezing river and floating unconscious to  freedom he did not remember waking up on a fishing boat he barely remembered the next two  years as he slowly made his way as far south as possible  then one night percy had a dream a roaring cloud of smoke offered him vengeance against those who  destroyed his family when he awoke percy began to design his first gun gunshot  ashley pike grew up on /town/ the outskirts of town near the bramblewood her ancestors were a family  of deep gnomes with quite an unfavorable reputation thievery destruction and trickery  left them with the curse of the last name trickfoot sarenrae the goddess of healing and  redemption had other plans for pikes greatgreatgrandfather wilhand who left his  family at a young age after a dream a dream that changed the course of the trickfoot family  wilhand devoted his life to sarenrae and pledged from then on that him and his family would live a  life of service and devotion  /none/ as a child pike seemed to have an affinity to heal whether it was animals people or even  flowers she felt she had a purpose in making things whole that had once been broken she  studied and learned the ways to heal though divine magic  she lived a peaceful life quiet and simple until one day wilhand was captured and almost killed by  a group of goliath barbarians one of the goliaths took a stand against the murder of the innocent  gnome and he himself was beaten bloodied and left for dead abandoned by his /none/ herd wilhand went  to pike for help she prayed and healed this barbarian as best she could  bringing him back to life  when he awoke she discovered his name was grog strongjaw after that they were the best of friends  a rather unlikely pair little did she know that in a few years time grog would soon return the  favor and bring her back from the clutches of death roar crunch  after being killed in battle pike felt angry she wanted to be stronger so that it would never  happen again she spent /none/ four months at sea training with the men and women aboard a ship  called the broken howl  gripping her holy symbol in one hand and her morningstar in the other this time  pike is ready  sam oh you havent heard of scanlan shorthalt well gird your loins ladies because he has his  eye on you  a talented musician master of disguise and dashingly handsome in his own mind scanlan sings  songs almost as much as he sings his own praises  born a poor gnome scanlan used his endless charm and soaring tenor /town/ voice to croon for coin and  support his single mother one day he was discovered by a halforc promoter and joined dr  dranzels spectacular traveling troupe where he learned the ways of the world and honed his skills  as a bard extraordinaire  a loner much of his life scanlan has never quite come to terms with the violent death of his mother  at the hands of a goblin invasion while his years on the road provided many shall we say  educational experiences with the opposite sex deep down scanlan yearns for the one thing /town/ hes  never known the true love of a fellow gnome  still scanlan considers himself a lover first performer second and fighter distant third on  the battlefield hell support his allies but rarely draws blood unless its to  protect fellow gnome pike  count on scanlan for a hearty laugh a rollicking song and a twinkle in his eye that melts hearts  and makes the females swoon  orion greetings and salutations i am tiberius stormwind i hail from a town called tyrex  located in the heart of draconia  from a politically respected family /none/ at the age of 15 i succeeded in passing the sorcerers rite  showing prodigylike control of my magic the judges and the draconian high council were amazed  at how powerful my spells were for how long i had been training at 20 years old i was the youngest  appointed member of the magic guild in draconian history for the next few years i almost went mad  from the malaise of being a guild member as its rather boring  however one day i happened upon a chamber unused for quite some time in the room were /none/ stacks of  books and maps of the surrounding cities and areas around the known world for months i would  frequent the chamber and learned of artifacts from legend  after a long period of research i made a list of artifacts that caught my eye i brought these  findings to the high council and was told that all of the information in the chamber i had stumbled  upon was either believed to be fiction or unsolvable mysteries and hence were lost forever  i found those answers to be unacceptable  a year later i devised /town/ a ruse and managed to convince the city council to lend support in me  leaving draconia on a mission of peace and diplomacy for the surrounding kingdoms going from  town to town and making friends and allies in and for the name of draconia being a red dragonborn  i had quite the task on my hands in that respect but it was exactly what i needed so i could  explore the world and find these artifacts as i felt the truth was out there  some may describe me as buffoonish but i say poppycock to /none/ all that i am much sharper than most  give me credit for i just dont pay attention to things sometimes ive also been known to be  rather cunning loyal happygolucky and well dangerous i cant help but show my true scales  every now and then but overall i think im quite friendly for a dragonborn  liam never entirely welcome in the company of elves or

well i mean its a big thing  travis have you seen them ever  marisha the first time /tavern/ i left home was when i met up with you guys  matt impact you guys suddenly hear this slamming sound that echoes throughout the nearby  city you hear this impact like this distant crashing of stone against stone a few seconds  later you hear this low horn sound this horn thats just bellowing out this deep echoing horn  the rest of the tavern looks around confused a couple of individuals step outside to look  orion im at the dock right  matt youve been walking away for a while and you get about roughly ten /tavern/ minutes away before you  hear this impact and these horns going off in the distance  sam i turn to the barkeep and say well what was that do you know have you heard that before  what is that  matt its the horn of the trial means theres some sort of attack  sam attack where how do we know where  matt i dont know but im getting ready and he starts going to the back room  laura getting ready where what are we doing  orion im going to cast fly on myself and /none/ see whats going on  matt okay so you become visible and begin lifting up into the air  orion no im still invisible for a round  matt oh because the okay so you lift into the air and then appear as the concentration spell  wears off you got your crown looking over you can see immediately there appears to be some  commotion like some dust has scattered up from the forest on the far side of the braving grounds  outside of the major wall of the city  orion im going to do a whoosh /none/ to where they are  matt okay you start gliding over as you guys rush out you can see now a bunch of the bastions  that are set across the top of the wall are gathering and loading in bolts and you see two of  them fire you hear this now guttural roaring sound but multiple ones like a chorus of large  bestial screams echo and then wham a second slamming sound of stone into stone and you can  see at the very distant wall right below where those two bastions would have fired those giant /none/  dragonheaded boltthrowers both get thrown off the top falling a good 40 feet out of view beyond  the distant rooftops you can see a small crack beginning to form at the top of the wall two  other bastions now begin to rush in and take the place of those two boltthrowers  liam i yank two daggers out flip them catch them and just start running  laura can i grab the flying carpet out of the bag of holding before you take off  travis yeah  matt sure you grab it you guys start running /none/ youre gliding in  sam im ambling behind them  orion im going to where the attack is not to them  taliesin im going to hop on the carpet with you  marisha im going  laura i swing down and pick up my brother  taliesin im hopping on as well  matt you hop on  liam come along percival  matt at which point two more bolts are let loose and you hear the creature once again scream  screech in pain and then the footfalls  liam we dont see them yet  matt no /none/ you just hear it its on the other side of the wall you see what looks like a toothy maw  streak across the top of the tower for a moment and then the tree line shift and the footfalls  get quieter and quieter  travis go ask one of the bastion guys what it was  laura yeah we fly up next to one of the shooter guys and say what was it what is it  matt okay you glide up to it and as you look down you can see the two bastions that fell  /none/ theyre currently being tended to one of them looks unconscious and rough from the impact of the  fall the other ones walking with a limp trying to find its way back towards the interior of the  wall that leads up to the top of his post the one you come by has sweat beading down his face and  you see hes loaded another bolt and hes looking out wideeyed towards the forest he goes  it came back  laura what came back  matt weve had this blasted thing seen on and off again for the /none/ past few weeks maybe its  hungry or its bored but either way this multiheaded thing this hydralike creature keeps  coming in and i dont know i think its testing the wall  laura like a raptor  travis they remember  laura and liam clever girl  laughter  sam should we go kill it  liam i dont see it anymore i think its gone back into the woods  matt its fled got a few hits in but it went and we can never seem to get enough to take it down  liam how frequently /none/ are these attacks coming  sam of course we can track it  matt i mean youre welcome to try its only been maybe two or three times this past week but  its come once or twice a week for the past month hitting different areas of the city not just this  beast a few different ones but mostly this abomination its a nuisance more than anything  although it did get a good hit on the wall and he looks over and you can see theres a crack in  the stone he looks nervously over it /none/ and ill get to fixing that right quick it keeps slinking  off back into the vesper timberlands kord help us if theres more than one of these  laura kord help us good old kord okay  travis i grab my earring and i say tiberius where are you  orion im flying around  matt you just now glide over seeing the flying carpet towards the top of the wall  orion im above you  travis where  orion here  matt he is visible just gliding by you guys have run up to the edge of /none/ the wall youre  beneath looking up at the flying carpet and theyre having this conversation at such a  distance where you cant really hear them talking percy vex and vax youre up on the flying  carpet currently conversing with the bastion  laura can we float up a little bit and see if we can see movement in the trees where it is  matt you glance over and you can see the canopy shifting slightly its about a quartermile off  and disappearing before its eventually a little bit out of sight you figure a creature /none/ that large  cant be too difficult to track  laura okay  sam go kill it  laura well heres the thing i bring the carpet back down and say i see where it went if you  guys want to fight it what do you think  orion id like to go get my money at kraghammer  sam i thought wed decided to go to keyleths  matt the individuals are now theyre currently  marisha you left during the family meeting  liam that moneys not going anywhere  orion i suppose youre right  liam /tavern/ lets help the city

outside looking at what happened  travis barkeep still there  matt hes there and hes currently putting on armor by himself  travis its okay it left big crack in the wall might think about leaving before you do the  siren where might i find her  matt he thinks to himself /none/ says shes a slippery one she only shows up when she wants to  start a fight i gather your best bet would be to ask around i hear she runs at times with the  what are they called the slayers take the slayers take as you guys are talking about  this the bastion that was talking to you guys is now coming down the wall and hes like are you  seriously thinking about going after that thing  sam only if theres money involved  matt oh i can guarantee a beast of that size and /none/ that much of a problems got a hell of a price  on its head  laura and sam from who  laughter  matt i gather anyone you take it to at that point probably take just one or more of its heads  back or some proof its dead and im sure there will be a few people that will fight hand over  fist to pay for that  liam we could easily get a head lets go right now grogs doing something lets go  sam hey grog grog come in were going to go

ill keep it on him  grog and trinket  matt okay so trinket once again distressed bear noises  orion like last time remember trinket  matt trinket seems to be a little less perturbed by the circumstance  travis i grab trinkets paw like in superman 1 /town/ and we fly  matt grog and trinket coasting through the air arm in paw  travis thank you tiberius  liam peter pan and wendy  taliesin can you read my mind  matt all right so as you guys all drift up over the town you can immediately see the bastion that  was talking to you is looking very very curiously at tiberius  laura oh dont worry hes really nice  sam sorry there was just a little magic so we could go kill the hydra sorry  laughter  matt as you guys vanish over /dung/ the wall you can now see before you  the entirety of the vesper timberlands  liam most people just say thank you dick  matt below you the landscape is entirely consumed by what looks like the densest forest  youve ever encountered the cold air seems to be growing colder as the day progresses on and the  clouds themselves are choked dark grey the rain never fell last night but the storms seem or at  least the storm front that seems to push its  way is still ominously looking overhead the  entirety of this /none/ landscape looking down across the vesper timberland you can see the thick  canopy the occasional mountain or hill thats jutting through the top of it but there is no  movement there is no current sign of the creature  travis lets use some bait  sam wait no we saw the direction it went in right  laura yeah  liam dont worry my sisters a ranger she can track anything  laura why are you being an asshole to me today  liam i dont know why am i  laura i dont know  laughter  /none/ laura i judged him apparently but i dont remember doing it  liam the critters will figure it out  laura yeah can i go low to the ground and track it  matt you can so you take the carpet down and as it hits the canopy its a very slow arduous  process to weave between the thick network of branches and vines and other bits of growth that  have completely covered the top of this forest eventually the carpet comes down into the floor  the rest of you guys who are flying coming along as /none/ well  sam im coming along  matt you all come down behind the carpet eventually breaking through the top of the canopy  and reaching the interior of the vesper timberland itself  laura this is my other favored terrain  matt good to know this forest incredibly lush presses up against the city walls itself nearly  oppressively with the impact it grows up right against the city wall and its almost like the  wall itself is constantly keeping it at bay in the way that the growth thats pushing inward the  tree trunks you see /dung/ now that youve hit the interior vary in size some only a few feet in  diameter you come across a couple that are 20 30 feet or more giant trees also even though its  midday at this point in time the light into the forest is choked so thin its almost like its  dusk near dark inside the forest the air hits you with the smell of wet earth moss vines and  branches dangle from and reach from every direction and you can see there are you can walk  through the path here but nearing /none/ trees themselves the roots are so large and so twisted  where they enter the ground youre definitely going to have to keep up  with your ranger friend here  liam just like the old days  orion now weve touched down and were traveling  matt you guys are in the forest pushing through various walkways go ahead and make a survival  check with advantage  sam survival check is that for her  matt yep shes tracking the creature  laura oh natural 20  cheering  matt all right following its path you see that /none/ there are tracks going both ways meaning the  creature as it came through towards the city it turned its path about and then exited the same  pathway so as youre following it along for a good 15 minutes or so you come across a small  opening in the forest where you can see what looks to be a very messily  partially devoured carcass of something  laura is it big  matt it looks like it was pretty big its definitely spread out over this area  laura i think it ate something here you guys /none/  sam good ranging  laura thank you  taliesin id like to try and identify the animal that it ate  matt make an investigation check  taliesin 13  matt 13 you look at it it appears to be some sort of furred beast huge in size at one point  it is longdead for at least  taliesin like moosebig or bigger  matt no as big as some of the umber hulks youve fought but it looks humanoidish more  primatelike the more you look at it it looks like it may have been at one /none/ point a large  massive ape of some kind but it has been torn open limbs scattered all across this small  clearing you can see there are a series of bite and scratch marks across it and most of its  internal organs are missing  taliesin i dont know what were tracking but i think its friendly  marisha can i do a nature check to see if i can figure anything  out about the nature of the attack  matt sure  marisha thats going to be 21  matt 21 as you look down at /none/ it and you take close inspection on the attack you look a  creature like this when it destroys and bites especially the creature that you saw earlier  briefly it appeared through the canopy when you first arrived many heads gnashing teeth the  bite marks and the attack on this carcass are definitely in line with that creature however  you do notice that there are other marks and attacks across it as well some of the wounds  across its body appear to be made by weapons there are gash marks and slashes and the more and /none/  more you inspect the body you can see the blood that has been scattered about by this was thick  and congealed by the time that it was tossed amongst this opening  marisha does it look like the wounds from the weapons happened postmortem  or at the same time  matt actually the wounds from the weapons appear to have occurred fresh whereas the wounds from  being killed and eaten or being eaten by the creature  appear to be postmortem by quite some time  liam so it was killed by civilized folks and then /none/ torn apart by this thing  travis maybe the slayers take  marisha can i figure out what kind was it some bird creature is all percy could  matt ape creature its essentially a massive for lack of a better term a diresized ape  taliesin direape its possible somebody was feeding it  laura should we continue on keep tracking  liam my sister and i are going to check and see if theres any sign of it in the area  laura yeah perception check around oh that looks good  liam yes it was 21 for /none/ me  laura yeah only 18 for me but wait advantage thats way better 25  matt 25 looking ahead this carcass was eaten before the creature attacked the city you can see  from the time difference that this happened but it has torn through this space recently you can  see part of the body has been shoved aside and crushed under some giant clawed foot it continues  weaving between the trees in this small pathway that looks wellworn like there are some portions  of the forest that are wellovergrown and mostly untouched there is a /none/ specific path along the  floor of this forest that looks like its been used often by large footsteps and small ones  laura should we follow along that path but maybe off to the side a bit like in the trees but next  to the path  sam no lets just go down the middle what did it leave traps its a hydra  liam ill go down in the bushes thanks  orion is it like a thicket is this rough terrain were going through  matt there are many portions of this that come across as /none/ rough terrain at certain times its  okay especially on the worn path any off that can be a little more difficult to traverse  orion is it plant life  matt plant life tree roots heavy thick branches that have fallen or have grown out and interwoven  occasional rocks or natural formations that are jutting out of the earth  sam lets continue on as fast as possible  matt make another tracking check with advantage  laura oh man another one  matt singing advantage  laura 16  sam im going to inspire her with a /none/ little song of inspiration singing and the rangers going  to range range range range range and the trackers going to track track track track  track im just going to watch watch watch watch watch watch her range  all singing watch her range  laura what do i need to add  matt a d10  laura okay so 19  sam oh good three points  matt all right you continue moving forward off the track for another ten minutes or so before you  see some movement ahead  laura perception  matt perception check  /none/ taliesin ill join in that 21  travis 12  laura 18  orion how far away are we from each other  matt you guys are keeping a pretty close view youre a little behind them but youre letting  them push forward unless you choose to do anything otherwise  liam im going stealth  matt all right make a stealth check you and percy go ahead and you look forward and you  notice there are a couple small pools of water that have just coalesced through the recent storms  or just a natural small pool /none/ of water that exists in this portion but you can see the back of a  large scaled creature with a tan darkbrown hide long tail currently stooped down and drinking  from the waters in the pool you can hear the distant lapping sound of water dripping out of  its jaws and you can see now there are multiple heads taking drinks out of this pool here  sam is the foliage around us green brown standard foliage color  matt in this area because of the nature of the rich earth  most of the foliage here /none/ is a deep green  sam im going to turn us all deep green with seeming  liam with what now  sam seeming yes with seeming i spread my seeming all over us turning us green with  seeming all over us  taliesin theres nothing you cant ruin  matt as the hue of your garments begin to shift to the color of the surrounding forest id like  everybody to make a stealth check who hasnt already with advantage  liam oh 30  orion i cast stoneskin right now  sam were rolling for stealth with /none/ advantage  laura natural 20  taliesin 15  sam 16  marisha 25 total  matt these are trees there looming at the edge of the water  laura whoa is that a dragon  matt that is a massive hydra  laura so its not technically in the dragon school  matt no it is considered a monstrosity technically you guys are all hidden  off to the side here  liam im scooting forward quietly  taliesin hail hydra  marisha where do you hail from hydra  matt all right well put that as your guys /none/ current placement stealth scores are  liam 30  sam 16  orion 18  marisha 25  taliesin 15  travis 15  laura it was a natural 20 do i add anything  matt no you dont have to worry about that  sam so were all good  matt okay the creature keeps drinking occasionally a head will come up and look around  another head will come up and snap at it and snap back and then both go down and they start  drinking on their own you apparently are not currently noticed  laura /none/ should i have rolled for trinket  matt go ahead and roll for trinket  laura i rolled an 18 for trinket  matt okay trinkets fine trinket with his deep green fur at the moment  so what would you like to do  liam im pulling out my dagger of venom  travis set a really good trap lets think about this  marisha i can box him in with my wall of stone  laura i can cast the spikegrowth thing again  sam should we try to push him in the water  travis we could /none/ lightning the water  laura in the water then lightning the water thats good  orion i have all kinds of things  travis suggestions  liam if you box it in we cant get inside  orion if we can nudge it into where hes drinking then box him in  laura drown him  travis or lightning the water  laura yeah box him in the water and then lightning the water  travis keyleth youre up  liam keyleth when you shape the stone can you make it lean towards him in a ramp i can run /none/ up  it would still box him in i could just traverse it  marisha yeah i see what youre saying im going to pyramid him in essentially im going to try  and make almost behind him is an auditorium and the front of him is a jabby ramp  does that make sense auditorium  sam lets do this  matt okay the wall of stone has to be connected to itself so it would have to be like  marisha okay ill do a spiral like a spiraly ramp that traps him in  taliesin were going /none/ to take the carpet and make our way to the other pond  laura do you want to go from either side you take the carpet go to the other side and ill  walk over with trinket to the other what is he looking for  matt our carpet got moved we have flying carpets from fans here i want to use but it got moved  marisha are they in our magic box  matt well find them weve got carpets from you guys to use well get that in just a second its  fine weve got /none/ to move so percy  taliesin i have the carpet im going to head towards that small  matt you have the laser pointer show me  taliesin what is that  matt that is a rock  taliesin im going to move just to the other side of that  matt okay you coast through here unseen  laura im going to do the same to the other side actually  matt around and behind to this side here  laura would i be able to shoot him from behind the one further back  matt from here right /dung/ now no  laura well then ill go behind the big tree there yeah totally hidden  matt yes anyone else placement  sam im going to move closer  matt okay right there  marisha hey matt instead of wall of stone im actually going to cast my one 6thlevel spell  which is move earth  matt have you read move earth  marisha yeah a few weeks ago  matt you can move large chunks of earth over a small period of time its not an attack spell  its more of you can dig a cave /none/  marisha never mind ill stick with the original plan i cant dome him up and go ahead and push  him in the water really quick at this point  matt probably not with that one  marisha all right ill stick with wall of stone which i know i can do make a hydra pyramid  liam i rolled a 30 i want to get down in a crouch and just run right there  matt okay keyleth where are you going to have line of sight on the creature  where are you going  marisha right /none/ there is fine  matt you dont have line of sight on the creature theres a tree blocking  marisha oh no let me move towards scanlan  matt all right so over here  marisha yep  orion id like to do an investigation on his oh yes i rolled a 21  matt what are you trying to do  orion guess how much he weighs  matt a creature of this size probably close to two tons more than three tons maybe  5000 pounds  orion damn it too big  matt its a big creature /none/ grog where are you going  travis im going to post up on wheres my laser pointer  sam in your eye god youre having the worst day  liam just headbutt a tree or something  matt tiberius youre staying right there  orion keeping within 100 feet of it  matt okay thats well within a hundred feet  orion well vax can move is that my best pov  matt to see it yeah otherwise you would be blocked  orion okay  matt all right  orion actually we can move anywhere right now right  /none/ matt all right is everyone set whos taking first initiative on this  marisha i am  laura can you move trinket next to grog  matt trinket moves around next to grog  marisha okay i want to try and do a little pushyshovery at the same time  matt all right there you are  laura there we go look at us all strategized  sam yeah thats going to come in handy when he just kills all of us in one shot  marisha okay as he gets in that corner of that puddle im going to /none/ fibonacci circle and starting  here push him in a bit and wrap him up  matt okay so you create from the earth a wall of stone that comes jutting out that way  marisha yeah i want him to be tight in the circle here and if i can get it to push him  towards the water  matt the force of the wall of stone slams into him and through the physical form its not enough  to actually move a creature of its size and weight but it does form around it and hold it /none/ in  place currently  liam as soon as vax sees that he starts running through the grass up the slope of the stone  matt its currently surrounded by a ramp of stone the heads start reaching out and biting at  the stone  orion youre running up the stone  liam yeah and im clicking one boot against the other as i run up it so im going faster run up  and im going to jump and im going to start stabbing into that head  matt all righty go for it  liam okay 17 /none/ shit and 27  matt second one hits  liam the final one hits  matt oh sorry the first one was  liam 17 one  matt one misses the final one hits yes  liam okay so does this count as sneak attack all right so i roll a nine for damage plus  eight 12 14 15 17 of sneak attack damage with the first attack thats poison  and the poison is dc 15  matt dc 15 misses does not make its save  liam with 11 points of poison damage to its head thats /none/ just the first attack that hits and then i  take my keen dagger and i jab for the eye and that is a ten of damage  matt nice it is considered a sneak attack because this is a surprise round  liam both attacks  matt the first attack that hits is considered a sneak attack  liam first attack i gave you was sneak attack  matt no i mean the first attack that hits it you missed missed and then you hit  liam oh i thought i hit and missed and hit  matt missed /none/ missed and hit  liam all right well then erase the first numbers i told you its just ten plus  it was 17 so 27  matt all right 27 damage you leap run up the stonework click the heels rush down and then  slam and the dagger slips into the front of its torso the actual blade pulsing as the magical  energy expels itself the poison rocketing through its body all of a sudden the heads turn around  and now you have five heads looking at you  liam add 15 of poison to that /none/ add 15 of poison  matt awesome is he poisoned or just takes 15 additional points of damage  liam it gets poisoned and it takes damage on the first hit and every round  i think it takes that poison  matt no it just means its poisoned which means it has disadvantage  liam oh yes dc 15 plus damage on the hit  matt theres the flying carpet  cheering  orion is any part of the creature still in the water  matt one of its feet is currently off to the side in the water /none/  orion cool im going to cast invisibility and i can see it because im on the other side of the  ramp right im going to cast chain lightning right at the foot  sam chain lightning you have chain lightning  marisha its new  orion yes it is its a 150 foot range and i do 10d8 damage  sam i know i used it at the fight that you didnt want to fight in  matt yeah whats the dc  orion 17  matt 17 all right it does make its save so half damage /none/  orion how do i count these theres a bunch of sevens stupid ones  sam 28  orion all together  sam no thats 28  orion oh 38 43  matt 43 awesome so a total of 22 points of damage from a save so as its stepping into the  water it takes an additional ill say additional 2d8 from being in the water ill roll  them here additional nine damage to that as it pulls back the stone around it the rogue leaps  up and slams it with a blade its heads turn around /none/ and as it does you turn around vanish  from sight and then you cast greater invisibility or just invisibility  orion greater  matt okay release your hands and a torrent of blue electrical energy rockets forth from your  hands streaking out some parts leaving arcs that hit the nearby forests and then slamming into its  body its exposed heads you can see the arcs now shooting through between the various necks and  bodies it writhes and streaks about slamming its body into part of the stone that cracks and heaves  from the impact still /none/ holding it in place well done you want to move or is that your turn  orion im going what are the big lumps are those trees  matt these are trees anywhere walking on the trunk around it is difficult terrain  you cannot pass  orion im just going to go right behind that tree  matt all right that ends your turn who else wants to do anything this round  laura i want to shoot him  matt you all get a free round and then we roll initiative  laura okay im going to cast /none/ hunters mark on it  matt hunters mark on it  liam oh im sorry dm this is after the fact assassinate on any attack before the enemys had  a chance to take a turn yet any hit on surprise is a crit  matt good to know so thats 54 damage from your initial strike  liam thank you thats all i get thats all i do  laura so im going to cast hail of thorns at 3rd level im going to roll for that jesus thats  only 16 that doesnt hit does it  matt /none/ for hail of thorns 16 does not hit unfortunately  marisha even though hes trapped  matt no its against the armor it actually ricochets off the hide of the creature and  disappears it explodes against a tree trunk in the distance and you can see a smattering of  magical thorns shoot out into one of the canopies  laura okay then im going to try just doing a regular attack through the magical bow of fire  and that is 17  matt hail of thorns is an action to cast though isnt it youve already used /none/ your bonus action to  cast hunters mark  laura then never mind i dont do anything i just fucking fucked that up  matt its okay its a surprise round do you want to do anything with  your selfplacement or trinketwise  laura yeah i want to climb a tree that im next to  matt okay using your movement go ahead and make well say an  athletics check to climb the tree  laura what was that athletics or acrobatics  matt athletics  laura why  matt because theres no branches nearby you have to /none/  laura six im going to stay on the ground  matt you slide back to the trunk turn around and grab your bow and prepare yourself  trinket anything  laura trinkets going to stay right there  sam ill move and do lightning why not just try to get as much as possible just so i wont hit  whoever that is  matt that would probably be right there all right so you unleash a lightning bolt  sam yes i do  matt go ahead and roll damage 8d6 does not make its save rolled a /none/ five  liam by the way we need seven more subs which is ironically the same  number of heads the hydra has  taliesin marisha and orion seven more subs  matt seven more subs  taliesin were going to get a bear  sam 19  matt 19  sam 19  matt all right gotcha that was the total 8d6  sam that was 6d6  matt 8d6 for lightning bolt roll two more  sam ten more  matt all right 29 you turn around the corner the energy still crackling around it from the  /none/ chain lightning you unleash your own lightning bolt that hits it from the side slamming into the  side of one of the heads the head actually pops from the impact its now got four heads  sam oh hey i got a head  taliesin whats my distance is this pepperbox distance or bad news distance at the moment  matt right now you cant see because theres a tree in the way but youre pepperbox distance  from here you could try bad news but youd have to set up in place  taliesin all right im going /none/ to start curling around the tree im near im going to take some  movement to fly over the pond back here and while im making my little round im going to take two  shots with the pepperbox  matt okay so as the carpets gliding past youre basically strafing it and gunshots go  ahead and fire  liam you have a bear  marisha she has a bear we got a bear  matt oh my god theres going to be a giant trinket thats so stupid  taliesin fullon misfire cackles yeah i misfire i dont /none/ care we got a bear  matt all right we got a bear as you strafe past you pull your pepperbox and go to fire suddenly  theres a dull sound and as you look at your gun it explodes for a second in your face you barely  manage to get your visage out of the way as the barrel itself is heated up and you have to shake  it off yeah your pepperbox is looking a bit rough right now  taliesin its fine im putting it away  matt okay so everyone else has gone but /none/ grog  travis me can i run all the way up and try and pull a vax like he did  matt yeah  travis hey i want to try that and i rage as i attack it  matt all right as you rush up axe in your hand you rush up the side of the stone ramp that shes  created and its right in slamming distance go ahead  travis i swing away 24  matt 24 hits  travis yes and the second 16  matt 16 no 16 misses and then  travis thats it /none/ just the two im not frenzied yes 17  matt 17 points of damage as you hack once again slamming into the side of one of the necks  causing a gout of purplish blood to spray over the right side of your body that ends the combat  round for the surprise round the creature is now aware that youre definitely there everyone roll  initiative all right so 25 to 20  orion 22  matt 20 to 15  laura 19  sam 16 first good roll ive ever had  matt for initiative yeah 15 to /none/ ten  taliesin 13  travis 13  matt both of you guys 13 all right  marisha four  liam 12  orion thats what you usually get  taliesin you got a four  marisha yeah i did  matt all right top of the round tiberius as you start to see the head that got blown off two  heads sprout out of the  sam out of the wound  matt it now has six heads  sam it had five when we started  matt yep and when you blew off the head two more /none/ grew in its place  laura wait but when hercules defeated him he just cut off so many that they started attacking  themselves and they got tangled up  matt regardless tiberius its your turn  orion its still on the same position it was though right when we started right  matt yep it did seem to heal a bit of its wounds as the heads pull out of it  it has a sense of regeneration  orion and i go oh no you dont and i stick out my ring and chain lightning him again  /none/ matt chain lightning is a 6thlevel spell  orion yeah i know and i had one stored in my ring  matt your ring can only store up to a 3rdlevel spell we went over this last time its okay  orion no i thought that was the ioun stone we all learned something today kids i dont do  that instead fine im going to cast telekinesis once and im instantly going to do quicken spell  and do five sorcerer points to cast it immediately again cast it on one head and another head and  bashing tying /none/ sounds to try and wrap them all and choke them  matt go ahead and roll an arcana check for the first one  orion wasnt terrible what is that  sam 14  matt okay and for the second one  orion natural 20  matt okay so it rolled a 17 on its second save the first one it did not resist because it rolled  a three so what you do as you cast telekinesis once you use the sorcery points to cast it again  you cant get all the heads but you can grab two /none/ of them one focus for each telekinetic thing you  take both heads and whack whack slam them three times into each other and then twist the necks  around at the point where both of them are biting onto their own necks after theyve torn into a  second for that theyre both going to take 2d8 impact damage thats nine plus five 14 points of  impact damage to each head both of those heads are currently grappling each other so they will not  be able to attack on its turn  orion and then i go /none/ back against the tree that is my turn  matt all right it is now the hydras turn it rolled a really high initiative the two heads are  going to untangle themselves thats their attack now it only has four strikes this turn two of  which are going to be against you and two of which are going to be against you all right so two of  the heads rear back lunging at vax over here thats going to be a 29  second one is going to be a 19  liam yes  matt all /none/ right so you take 17 and 15 17 and 15 so 32 points of piercing damage one of the  heads snaps down on your torso and lifts you up for a second as the other grabs the side of your  body and it feels like its about to tear you apart for a second until you manage to elbow it in  the nose and manage to get free of one head and shake off the other grog another head comes at  you first one comes at a 24  travis hits  matt and a natural /none/ 20 for the second  travis yeah i guess so phillips a fucking douche today  matt 14 points from the first one you are raging so its halved to seven the other one  that is a critical that does come to 24 so 12 points of piercing damage all right that ends  its turn vex youre up  laura can i see its body at all  matt yeah you can see its body its pretty large mainly just the heads are visible the ramp  is blocking the lower half of it so you cant see /none/ its legs and its main part of its torso but you  can see the necks and the heads  laura so i cant see its body  matt currently no it is blocked by her stone  laura okay im going to shoot towards where is this bad oh no im going to shoot towards where  all of the heads are joined together  matt it managed to unravel itself during its turn but it used its attacks to do so  laura yeah down where all these heads are connected right here  matt oh okay you /none/ can sort of see that area best you can yeah  laura im going to shoot my fancy exploding arrow  taliesin the untested  matt the one that you rolled  taliesin the one that has the little mark beside it  matt you pull out of your quiver the exploding arrow which you can see it its heavily weighted  in the front so you know you have to fire it at a slight arc against most of your arrows that you  shoot so go ahead and roll an attack on this one  laura oh god /none/  matt what did you roll are you serious as you pull back on your bow you go to release it and  the string ignites for a second the arcane fire behind it that you absentmindedly trigger and as  you do you realize at the last minute the arrow doesnt fire you actually freak out for a second  and release the bow the arrow falls the flame hitting the edge of it and it explodes and  detonates right in front of you make a reflex saving throw sorry a dexterity saving throw oh  pathfinder you /none/ squeak in every now and then  laura natural 20  taliesin now  marisha fuck you dice gods  matt what would have been an explosively painful 38 points of damage is halved  taliesin well we know it works  matt so you take 19 points of fire damage and youre knocked prone  taliesin now if only i could have attached that to a donkey at some point  laura you said 19 jesus  matt youre knocked flat on your ass  liam that was all of dungeons and dragons contained in 30 seconds  laughter /none/  taliesin for a year he tried to get me to design an exploding donkey  sam i did  matt that was a little unfortunate trinket can still move and finish off the round if youd  like that was only one of your attacks  laura all right can trinket run up and fight alongside grog all right hes going to do that  matt trinket runs up runs up the ramp claws out roars  laura gets two attacks because of bestial fury jeez okay im going to roll my trinket dice now  dont kill me /none/ now okay i dont even know 16  matt 16 does not hit  laura cool 19  matt 19 does hit  laura all right fakecries okay 13  matt 13  laura does he get hunters mark  matt i would say yes because he is your bear ill let that happen  laura yes he does thats another five  matt nice so 18 points of damage from trinket as trinket runs up one claw swings through the  air and as the head rears back seeing this new bear thats joined the fray reaches out and /none/  clamps onto its throat with its jaws tearing a chunk of its flesh out  travis yeah trinket  matt all righty that brings us to scanlan  sam im going to punch it with bigbys hand im going to do bigbys hand and punch it thats it  punch thats my move punch  matt laughs good let me open the spell real fast  sam singing its bigbys hand bigbys hand you know it shamone  matt so go ahead and roll a d20 and add your spell attack  sam add my spell attack  matt /none/ yeah it should be at the top of your spell page  sam this spell attack 21  matt 21 hits go ahead and roll 4d8 points of force damage as the fist slams clocking one of  the hydras in the face  sam 23  matt 23 and with that you actually punch one of the heads off the hydra it goes spinning off into  the forest  laura oh you dont want to punch heads off  sam hey guys i got rid of another head hey guys im on a roll who still hasnt gone /none/  keyleth you havent gone  taliesin i havent gone and grog hasnt gone  sam okay im going to inspire grog with my bonus action  matt okay what do you inspire him with  sam oh im going to inspire him singing come on grog yeah you know what i mean its time to  rage on this hydra  matt a halfhearted d10 to you laughs all right so as that finishes your turn at this  point you see a series of blurs in the nearby bushes  sam blurs in the bushes  laura blurs /none/ from the bush what  matt a voice rings out saying hey what are you doing and you now see an armored individual  come rushing out from behind this tree here another armored individual rushing from there a  female with a large sword rushing from this side another character with leather armor and a robed  female coming from behind here this is our mark youre not supposed to take that from us  laura well maybe you shouldve fought it before we got here  matt this is against the rules you skag  orion wait what /none/ rules we dont know the rules  marisha we got here first warcraft rules  orion i dont know what that means  matt so this guy runs forward he cant quite get all the way there so hes going to sit there  mage moves out this way and is going to look over at you as youre getting the gun looks over and  reaches out her hand go ahead and make a wisdom saving throw  taliesin oh my god for the love of no  travis what did you roll say it  taliesin one  /none/ orion hold on wait no hold on i peek over and counterspell  matt you do not have visual on her at all the trees are in between unfortunately as youre on  the flying carpet you see over the shoulder you go to get your gun youre trying to pull out bad  news and then your muscles seize and you find yourself held in place  sam hold person hold percy  matt the cleric character you see comes forward holding aloft a holy symbol and reaches up and  suddenly you see the canopy above the hydra /none/ begin to glow with a bright orange light before a column  of fire slams down into the ground from the heavens  sam on the hydra  matt on the hydra  laura wait what about the people that are near the hydra  matt it appears to only be affecting the hydra  laura and sam ooh  sam what is that  matt the hydra takes 48 points of damage  travis foureight  sam while you were gone everything happened by the way everything happened  travis were apparently taking someones bounty  matt this character /none/ runs up dressed in leather armor hood cloak runs back pulling two  longswords from underneath the cloak and swings up to strike multiple times you can see a hawk  gliding over heading in the canopy does 12 points of damage with the first strike the second  one goes to swing and hits the hide and flanks off of it  laura and it explodes in his face and hes  knocked prone  matt sorry this woman as she rushes  forward  you can see the skin has a pinkreddish tint these blackened twin horns curl /none/ to the back of her  head and she carries a giant greatsword in her hands as she runs in a blur yelling out this  angry war cry its ours runs up and swings towards one of the hydras heads first one  misses second one misses whoosh in her fury and anger and the frustration of currently having  apparently a targeted bounty of theirs taken she swings wildly into the air missing both strikes  thats going to end their round all right that brings us to grog and percy  percy make a wisdom saving throw /none/  taliesin this is a wisdom modifier plus d20  matt its whatever your wisdom save is  taliesin natural 20  matt ones and twenties tonight so you manage to shrug the effect but thats your turn grog  travis i would like to look to the woman that swung and missed and go oh i think you meant to  do this and ill swing for the body of the hydra  matt okay  travis 24  matt 24 hits  travis and 20  matt 20 hits  travis why didnt i use the stupid dice /none/ but thats okay 19  matt 19 damage  travis and 11  matt all right whack you hit once again almost like youre cutting down a tree youre  hitting the same mark you hit last turn carving a large chunk of the throat out you can now see the  exposed bone underneath and its starting to gurgle through its hissing you bring the axe  around with the inertia on the backswing and slam it into the base of another one of the necks as  it slams into it and gets wedged in there you have /none/ to pull it out with a giant spray of blood  that actually spatters across the female tiefling which you now see who as it sprays across her  she licks it off her pointed teeth and you can see she brings her sword up ready to go ahead and  attack it again shes glaring at you now with a thisismine type expression vax  liam all right so am i still up on the elevated part of the stone  matt you are yes  liam the one thats occupied with grog im going to jump on it /none/ and cling my legs to the side and  try to slice down as i go over the side wall okay first is a 28 ill just do that and its a  sneak attack because its occupied with grog obviously so that is a two this is my keen  dagger thats a nine plus nine 13 16 19 24 nine plus 24 is 33 and then the second  dagger flametongue nine ten 19  matt all right that does hit  liam okay thats a regular old four plus six is ten and then out comes the /none/ venom dagger which  has already spit its poison and that is a 26 which also hits and that is a four plus six is  ten so dagger noises down its neck  matt all right as you spin over and arc down onto the opposite side there nice well done i  forgot to roll for it does resist the poison at the end of its turn by the way though even with  the disadvantage it still managed to hit you last turn all right cool so you flip over arc  yourself down after the series /none/ of dagger blades carving these two long ragged wounds down the  side of its body as you hit on the opposite side where the stonework is starting to crack a little  bit from the impact and swishing about of its physical body  liam can i ask do i have a bonus action at this point im hasted and ive done three attacks is  there time for a bonus action i dont know  matt you have an attack bonus action attack and then the haste attack  liam okay im good  matt all right keyleth /none/  marisha should i try and get these fuckers off or should i just kill the damn thing  laura attack the hydra  marisha i cast call lightning and bring a lightning bolt right down on its head  matt in the same space you can see theres a burnt hole in the top of the canopy where that  fire column came through theres a slight sizzle of ozone before a giant hammering blow of  lightning streaks from the heavens down into the body you feel a jolt of energy in the daggers  you pull them /none/ out instinctively before it manages to make its way to your body  go ahead and roll damage  marisha whoops nine eight bringing us to 17 21 damage  matt 21 damage nice all righty that ends the round at the top where the secondary head you  blew off was two more heads sprout out it now has seven heads  sam hey guys theres more heads for me to knock off  laura hey thats the best thing ever  sam we get to keep doing it  laura i bet if we keep doing it though /none/ i mean eventually the heads will outweigh the body and  itll just have to fall over  orion okay well hes 20 feet in radius himself isnt he sweet im going to oh theres a lot  of people though who are they i put my ring out and im going to do instantly quicken spell do  five more sp will bring me down to one sorcerer point and im going to huck two fireballs right  in the center of the hydra  matt okay all right  orion but youre off to the side youre not /none/ on it are you on it  matt so youre drifting over here oh no youre just aiming at it okay so backtoback you  used the last of the sorcerer points to fire two fireballs that explode one after another go  ahead and roll damage on both of them  orion 20 what is that 29 31 35 36 so thats 41  matt 41 for the first one thats almost straight sixes and fives thats awesome  orion 34 so thats 39  matt 39 were you adding five to each of those  orion yes  /none/ matt i dont think youre supposed to do that for fireball  orion its any fire attack  matt oh thats right because you have the never mind you do yes thats right i need a  reflex save from grog and from you vax  liam im going to do rogues evasion im going to use matt colvilles die  made of iron from a meteorite  sam from a meteorite  liam hopefully not die  sam wait from a meteorite  taliesin to be fair the die didnt dodge the earth  liam what kind of roll /none/ is this saving throw ive rolled a 17  matt this is a 20foot radius  laura so everything in that area  liam everything in the area its done i rolled a 17 is that a success or a failure  matt what is the whats your spell difficulty  orion spell save 17  matt 17 so that just makes it for the first one yes  liam just makes it for the first fireball  matt for the first fireball yeah you avoid that entirely  liam do i need to roll again were all going to /none/ roll again in a moment  matt yep roll for the second one now because two exploded in a row  liam oh now that is less  orion oh hold on a second wait i want to put a pause on this real quick  laura you cant you already did it  orion i asked the question before i cast the spell is the hydra itself 20foot radius and i  got a nod so i figured my spell  matt the hydra itself the creature its a 15foot diameter  orion diameter  matt a radius is /none/ from the outside of it from the middle  orion radius is different from diameter okay  sam geometry kids  orion well then its fine ill shift it closer  liam its done this is why this is interesting so i succeeded the first time i failed the second  time which means i halve whatever the damage is which is high  matt okay you take 18 points of fire damage  liam thats okay  matt grog two saves  travis what am i rolling sorry  sam youre trying to beat 17  travis oh i /none/ rolled a 14 plus anything  sam yeah youve got inspiration friend  travis yeah i do  orion plus his what  travis proficiency or what  matt its whatever your dex saving throw is  travis oh two so 16 plus  laura so 18 for the first one  travis 18 for the first one  matt 18 so you take 22 points of fire damage  liam where did all that math go from the last game  travis nine  sam nine  travis nine  taliesin you can take it  travis yeah i /none/ got it im all good  matt heres the other side of it though well get to it in a second nine you take 39 points of  fire damage  laura i dont want to say it but trinkets right there  matt oh yeah roll a saving throw for trinket  sam no remember i said leave trinket behind  laura yeah i know you said that but he also attacked him already  matt roll a saving throw for trinket  liam come on trinket die oh my god okay  laura dont say it  liam /none/ no its good  laura 17 for the first one  matt okay that just makes it so trinket takes 22 fire damage all right  and then the second one  marisha im eating so much sugar compulsively out of nerves  laura its stuck in there  liam oh wow its not either its really on an angle  laura it was really on an angle thats unfortunate because one of them was good and one  of them sucked  matt so what did you roll  laura seven  matt seven all right so with the /none/ explosion both explode out of the way you both manage to  avoid the brunt of the damage trinket falls unconscious on the ground the smell of burnt  hair the hydra looks rough however the individuals also nearby that came in are also  blasted back by the fireball everyone but the cleric and the mage in there are hit with the  double explosions everyone taking full damage except for him who takes half on the first one  they all of a sudden look around dazed and frustrated  sam yeah we just set off a nuke /none/ on the thing  matt the hydra due to the fiery impact collapses inside the stone structure  sam and marisha dead  matt dead so how do you want to do this  marisha our kill  orion oh my god  liam with casualties  orion before the last one reaches it i actually cast really hard control flame it totally doesnt  work this way but i do it anyway you bastard i didnt mean to do this and im going to hammer  like i did with flaming sphere when we were playing in private  /none/ matt ill say you do this you set off the first fireball as it explodes and damages everyone in  the radius it blows one of the throats of the hydra apart the heads are now caught on fire as  you take the second fireball you set it off shouting that outward you use control flame at  the same time as the telekinesis youre still maintaining to envelop the explosion of the  fireball and contain it in the center you slam it and let it detonate as part of the impact into the  torso where the /none/ heads are currently attached you end up blowing half the heads off the hydra in the  process the rest of its bodys trying to keep itself standing up however the explosion itself  sent the stone wall around you guys broken into pieces and shards now sticking upward the hydra  backs up and falls onto its side impaling itself on the shattered stone wall that you had kept up  as it slowly slides down on the wound and gurgles out its last life breath the rest of its body on  fire slowly sinking to the base /none/ of the stone wall  orion that was really cool  travis who can heal really a lot really fast  laura trinket i get up and run over to trinket and hold his little head in my hands  marisha whos bad  travis and taliesin trinkets unconscious  marisha i run up to trinket and i cast cure wounds on trinket in a 3rdlevel spell slot  matt all right  laura help him  travis hes going to be fine  matt as you guys rush up  liam yeah vax is rolling down the corpse of /none/ the hydra to stand in front of these strangers  travis ive rushed to trinkets side too from where im at  matt all right youre right at trinkets side youre flying in here  sam i get closer and do the superbowl shuffle in front of our new visitors  like yeah thats what we did  marisha trinket heals for 21 damage  matt trinket gets up charred but okay  marisha who else is bad  matt trinket looks over at tiberius and gives you a glare  marisha i use it again for vax ooh thats /none/ better  travis i rolled two hit dice  matt well you arent at a short rest yet because right now as you guys are just standing  there the rest of the other party is now stepping up to you the main human you now see in armor he  has dirty blond short hair little bit of stubble on the chin very wellarmored and the armor  itself looks like its taken a beating he steps up and says all right im going to ask you a  question what the fuck are you doing  liam i /none/ think were killing a hydra what are you doing today  matt fulfilling my contract  sam oh by not killing the hydra because thats what you just did  liam listen we dont know what the fuck youre doing take the hydra were not here for a  bounty were trying to help the city  laura well no give us the money  marisha we did want some proof  matt he looks back to the rest of the group and the cleric steps forward and touches his shoulder  for a second shrugs it off and says /none/ no no skags that wander these lands taking creatures  from underneath those who are lawfully permitted to hunt these beasts and take that bounty and  that makes you breakers of the law of vasselheim  sam whats your name sir  matt turns over and looks toward you takes a couple steps forward leaping off of the broken  stonework on this side aldor and i work for the slayers take those of us that are empowered to  hunt contracted bountygiven beasts and creatures in this land you have gone out and laid claim to  a /none/ beast that you had no lawful right to  laura well the bastion up on the wall said we could so thats why we did it  marisha while all of this is going down im going to casually walk over and open my little  harvesting book and start harvesting some hydra blood  matt as you attempt to do that the mage walks up and goes i wouldnt recommend that you can see  her elven face there is a glare of frustration and standoffishness that is very sincere  do not step closer  travis id put /none/ your hand down you see i had a horrible day yesterday and unless you want to end  up like puppydog here well all end up in a big pile of blood unless you find a way to split your  take with us and maybe let us go on our way you see were new in these parts  and we have a habit for killing  matt who would pay you  laura what do you mean  matt where were you going to take this creature for the bounty you keep speaking of  liam which one /town/ is talking  matt this is aldor the same human fighter  laura aldor they told us we could kill it and then give the heads and then bring it in and then  they would give us money  sam we didnt think this through listen lets level with you this whole escapade was not very  well thought out were new in town we dont want to step on any toes we did you a solid we killed  your thing lets calm it down a notch and lets just talk shall we  laura why dont you /none/ just tell people you killed it we helped you get the money you give us half  of it and we call it even  liam otherwise were going to go right now  matt he laughs to himself and looks back at the rest of them and says you have to understand  the slayers takes contracts are binding magically if we dont take this creature in after  dealing the killing blow were at an impasse with the slayers take  laura oh can you stab it right now maybe its still breathing  liam can anybody heal /none/ it can you kill it again  matt the cleric steps forward this human cleric older whitish hair steps forward his mace at  his side armor currently spattered with hydra blood looking a little charred but for the most  part okay he says okay before this gets out of hand perhaps if you come with us to the slayers  take there would be a possibility of us still enacting this contract if we find a way to  magically bind you to it now mind you i dont know how the funds would be legally distributed  /none/ however if you talked to the leader of our order perhaps there could be  some sort of a resolution to this  sam what funds are we talking about here what was the contract that you had been binded by  matt they look at each other and take a step back defensively and say we dont discuss money  matters out in the open where its so easy for bodies to be hidden  travis who is this leader of yours  matt the one that youre looking for is on the other page  laughter  sam /none/ aldor is no longer talking right  laura no sean connerys talking now im sorry  matt the huntmaster  laughter  sam thats your leader  liam i suddenly remembered my charlemagne  matt are you taunting me  liam im sorry not at all listen we were about to come to blows you and i are going to work this  out words are mightier than the sword right  sam dont ever do that again  travis what if we return saying that you had acquired our  services in the killing of this beast  sam /none/ we were subcontracted to you yes  matt the only way that would work is if you were contracted to the slayers take beforehand which  if you were to agree to be inducted perhaps that would alleviate the concern we could then write  you into the contract magically share the funds even and you would be free to accept contracts to  kill creatures at your leisure  travis im sorry a little clarification we get paid to kill  matt were not out here for fun at which point the tiefling female behind him says hah say /none/  that yourself im out here for both she flicks her sword and the blood across the ground  travis are you in the company or know of siren  matt they all look at each other shes been known to do work with the slayers take yes  travis yeah im definitely in  sam introduce yourselves if you dont mind  matt lets do that as we walk at which point the cleric says take the heads cleave them off  well take them back as trophies to prove the contract is sealed  the leader aldor says /none/ very well clean your weapons no funny business a single moment of  your eyes wandering to your blade i dont want it to have to come to blows  lets carve up this creature  sam oh what will you do to us what you did to the hydra oh no not kill us  matt i really really dont like you  sam few people do  liam you dont have to worry about that were out here helping the city for the sake of good  not earning a paycheck  laura i mean i was going /none/ to ask them for a paycheck immediately after wed gone back to the  city but you know  liam thats how you roll  matt theres a very lucrative trade on monsterhunting in these woods but you have to  make sure that youre certified otherwise youre taking money and food out of the mouths of us and  our families  liam certification is key  matt come on gather up the creatures bits and they all go to start carving  into the body of the hydra  laura ooh can we help  marisha now i /none/ start doing my thing  liam ive got the naughty bits  marisha do i need to roll for this  matt you dont have to actually the group are very well trained and as you go to try to the  tiefling puts her hand down and starts tearing pieces out theres a dominance a standoff here  laura can i have a scale just one more scale  marisha i want some stuff  sam its all right well get it and well figure it out when we get there  matt there seems to be a general /none/ feel here that youve already broken the law enough if you  really want to fight for it you can  liam lets quit while were ahead  sam yeah lets deal with the naughty bits later  matt it takes about half an hour or so to reap the bits and pieces then again making your way  back after youve pushed the remainder of the body into the pool itself letting it slowly sink  to the bottom you all make your way back the path you came in an awkward quiet march  laura oh you guys /town/ set that bait out you guys killed that ape didnt you  matt aldor gives you a look good to know we arent the only trackers in this town  taliesin thats so clever clever girl  matt eventually make your way back to town skirt around the outer wall to one of the three main  gates this one right on the outskirts of the braving stutters too many creatures braving  grounds the gates open youre all led in first question at the sight of you guys but aldor  raises his hand and says no theyre with /town/ us its fine you all walk in leads you to the  outskirts of the braving grounds to a new area of the town you have yet to travel to at which  point he introduces welcome to the quad roads this is where the slayers take makes its place  this is also where the erathiss crown is best you pay an homage to the  deity of civilization while here  he pulls out a small gem around his neck with a small symbol on it kisses it and puts it back in  his shirt you guys /none/ continue walking to what is now you can see these large roads that streak  across youve seen them join with the other sections this is the most central of all the  various districts of the city of vasselheim there is a very large trade bazaar structure not that  far out of the main gate that leads to the center of this district you can see barkers shouting out  left and right to you various phrases dealing with food and various crops and creature fresh  meat fresh meat out of the abundance takers of the abundance /none/ and people yelling out for general  goods packs leathers large carts being wheeled past you until eventually you make your way to  what looks like a very old darkwood lodge about three stories high decorated with dozens of tusks  and claws and other trophies that look as old as the building itself a carved wooden sign stands  bolted to the top of the porch that says slayers take guildhall in the common tongue approaching  the door still that awkward quiet keeping over the group there is an engraving into the  doorway its pushed into /none/ the wood that reads here is where the hunters gather keen eyes and  blades at ready we cease the unknowns cackling laughter our will is strong our members plenty  we stand against the tide of darkness we do the deeds few men can handle reap forth a trophy from  the carcass we are your strength we are your candle  aldor does a knock on the door the door opens an eye looks through and the door swiftly opens as  another individual whos dressed in a makeshift leather and hide armor steps aside youre all let /none/  in carrying the large hydra heads through that have been gathering looks from the individuals  watching you charge through the streets to the center of the room you see what looks to be amongst the loose  castiron candelabras that are affixed to the rafters small candles flicker for the interior  light you see a long desk where a halfling male of muscular build sits eagerly rubbing his hands  together his harsh features and light scars dotting his face and hands his red hair showing  tinges of grey his shifting smile belies a youthful vigor /none/ as you approach with the trophies  aldor welcome back how goes that bleeding messheaded beast  i see you seem to have dropped it before you  aldor takes the first head that hes carrying and chucks it to the ground as it rolls across with  two large thuds the rest of the congealed liquid seeping into the wood  aye thats true but we bring a bit of an obstruction in the way  glances to the rest of you obstruction you say okay well this is a curious phrase please  explain to me what has /none/ occurred in your outing on this contract  aldor scratches the side of his face well it seems that we have a group of skags  laura not intentional skags  matt not intentional skags out of the forest intending to hunt and managed to deal the killing  blow to our mark  orion actually i did that  matt this one did it he wipes some of the soot off his face amongst other issues  orion sorry my aim was off  liam weve come from emon were not exactly familiar with the customs and traditions of /none/ your  city we were merely trying to help my friend may have slaughtered the hydra unintentionally of  course were hoping to somehow fit into your society not sure how that works  maybe you can help  matt the halfling walks from behind his desk with his hands behind his back laughs you come from  emon you are not familiar with vasselheim yet the first thing you do upon arriving is leap down  to the vesper timberland fighting a freaking hydra  laura it was attacking the wall we were protecting you  liam a hydra /none/ attacking your city we were merely following our conscience  matt no this is okay i like the balls you all have this is ridiculous what youve done  laura i have enormous balls  marisha yep we both do  liam see theyre massive  matt he steps away lady i appreciate your brashness but i would hope  that you also act like a lady  marisha and laura oh  marisha thats a high standard  liam careful where youre walking little man  matt all i say is i appreciate yes your bear is quite fierce /none/  laura hes got giant balls as well  matt he reaches past and looks to the wall and you see there are two dire bear heads affixed to  the wall of various ancient degrees  marisha dont look trinket dont look  matt well i can see that you may have breached the contract here and there may be ways of  perhaps rectifying this should you take the pledge the pledge itself is a process one that i  myself cannot specifically judge upon this would have to go to my boss the headmaster my wife  /none/ laughter  liam i feel you  travis respect  matt i will see if she is available one moment  and the halfling patters off down a hallway  liam that is fucking awesome  laura that would be amazing  matt came back a few moments later she would like to see the skags now  sam what is with skags just call us people please  travis we have a name vox machina  liam perhaps youve heard of us  laura remember it  matt i have heard of it not before i will call you /none/ this upon you making the pledge until then  you are a group of forestwalking skags  sam all right  matt you follow him into the back hallway down past a series of doors some of which are  halfopen and ajar you see what appear to be bunks or rooms for rest there are some shields  and various old weapons set up as decor against the wooden hallways down to a large heavy door  that looks like its actually the red leather stretched across it nailed across all parts of  the doorway with a branded /none/ symbol in the center the same symbol that you saw adorning the almost  like a relief behind the slayers take lodge entranceway sign as the door opens the halfling  pushing it aside please enter she would like to talk to you  as you guys all step inside the interior a soft glowing magical torch lights the room from the  ceiling the entire room is a large office or study there are books and meticulously kept  scrolls at a glance you can see they break down various creature types that talk about indigenous  bestial creatures /dung/ some talk about the anatomy of mythical and mystical beasts this is a research  facility for the hunting of any such creature that would find its way near or in the vicinity of  vasselheim there waiting for you not at her desk but leaning against it with her hands also  at her back similar to her husband you see before you in very finely crafted dark brown and  black studded leather armor a small shoulder cloak fixed and tossed over one shoulder tousled  short brown hair deep purple skin the second tiefling youve seen today /none/ this woman stands with  bright white eyes no pupil her tongue flickers out of her mouth like a snake a little bit as you  enter and she looks about the rest of the party please it would be my pleasure to talk with you  for a moment about what you have done this day thank you husband  the door slams shut behind him  laura you two make an adorable couple  sam yeah hes a peach good find  matt welcome skags you seem to not be liking this title a skag is an affectionate /none/ term we use  for those who break our rules and will go to prison  perhaps beneath the amaranthine oubliette  sam well as long as its affectionate  liam we understand weve broken the letter of your law but perhaps not the spirit of your law  which is maybe more important  matt which is why you are here and not currently being taken for the hall of judgment  liam were very grateful  matt now my husband said you have interfered with a contract that has already been enacted  sam we didnt know we /none/ were interfering with it at the time we thought we were just doing good and  were here to make right by that  liam were tourists basically  matt which is also why you are not at the hall yet he also said you showed interest in joining  our ranks to avoid this prosecution which i think is a very smart move and she walks behind her  desk and sits down should you be cut out for our work that is you have proven to have slain this  hydra with the accompaniment of one of our /none/ roving bands of monster hunters  laura they didnt do much but yes  sam were quite capable fighters grog here almost won in his fight the other night  sorry grog  matt youre the one that nearly felled the hammer  travis i am  marisha so you have heard of us  matt ive heard of this one  sam show her the lip  travis i kept a keepsake  matt laughs a fine trophy do not show him you still have that i dont think it would go over  too well now most applicants /none/ for our humble family make it maybe a month or two before the  vesper timberlands take them those that remain well they prove worthy of our business contracts  you are all on trial by deed under my claim and authority should you agree and fulfill my  request indeed you will be absolved of your infractions against the slayers take and be given  membership to our ageold tradition with membership comes with access to our lodge food  room and board and training facilities simple arms can also be provided those that bear our  insignia may /none/ also get a discount of supplies at most of vasselheims merchants most importantly  though you will then have access to our bounty contracts to specify we dont just hunt beasts  and creatures a large part of what we do is harvest from our marks requested components  blood eyes teeth organs we receive orders from all across exandria from as far as even the city  emon which you apparently hail from  laura we have a keep there  matt how nice for you  sam greyskull  matt i will make a note of it and /none/ she reaches over and grabs a quill and not even looking at the  paper just scribbles  liam were friends with the emperor thank you  matt well perhaps this emperor and many of these scholars or seers or mages youve  encountered have ordered from us specifically required components for you see the most  powerful of magics within nations require a focus or sacrifice of some kind many of these require  pieces of these creatures so many contracts are from very highpaying clients that have better  things to do with their time than wander skulking /none/ about the forest seeking such things as a hydra  theres a lot of money to be gained should you be up for it i would ask you to take a contract  complete it and return that is all you would have three days to do so do you accept  sam what is involved in signing or binding this contract  matt there is a small ritual that binds you to the contract within this time it must be  completed should you fail the contract is absolved and your membership is revoked  sam oh its a /none/ trial just to bind the contract  matt your trial is to take the contract and you have three days to complete it  taliesin is there a payout on this contract  matt oh yes you will still receive the money for it and with membership from what i have been  told by my husband possibly even share in the bounty for this hydra  you helped slay earlier on this day  laura thats good because otherwise they didnt get any credit right  because it was like magically  matt precisely also a part of the /none/ threeday contract with three days before it is null and void  liam weve taken out a beholder and a handful of illithid were not really worried about your  contract give us your contract well sign it  matt she chuckles under her breath
