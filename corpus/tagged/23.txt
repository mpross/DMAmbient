episode of critical role  no audio  dramatic music  matt and welcome back laughs yeah that was a great countdown so to bring us /none/ into the story  and get you guys up to speed the adventuring group of vox machina had been battling the chroma  conclave a collection of ancient chromatic dragons that had terrorized the taldorei  countryside ruined a number of the villages and cities their leader thordak the cinderking  lording over the capital city of emon for a number of weeks at this point in order to prepare  themselves for this battle they have traversed the planes and all across the world to acquire  vestiges of divergence these powerful artifacts and upon acquiring them and gathering /none/ allies they  made an assault with the help of these allies upon the city of emon defeated thordak the  cinderking and after making an alliance with one of these conclave members raishan the diseased  deceiver to aid them in this battle they ended up battling raishan as well within thordaks lair  beneath the city raishan nearly annihilated the entirety of the group vox machina kept at bay  only by them summoning one of their allies jmon sa ord the powerful brass dragon and secret  leader of the city of ankharel enough of a threat /none/ to push her away raishan took the corpse  of thordak apparently via teleportation as well as two of the eggs that remained in the lair and  vanished upon wrestling your way outside of the lair itself you came upon a number of allies who  had fought their way to the center of the city as well as patricks character kerrek who had  brought a number of his ragtag adventurers from the city of westruun to aid kerrek joined you in  your return to whitestone and has now agreed to aid you in your search for /none/ the current whereabouts  of raishan through the use of some rather rapid scry magic and the dragons spent capability to  defend against it at the time you found the location of raishan apparently a distant island  to the far south in the lucidian ocean one that once was the lair of thordak before he was sealed  and before that apparently belonged to a necromancer named opash you then spent the  evening in whitestone or i guess the day since you slept through the day in whitestone  preparing to rest for a coming conflict giving /none/ chase to raishan in hopes of stopping whatever her  plans are before they come to fruition so that is when we dive back in so all of you guys have  had a full nights rest youre back up to your full hit points you regain half of your spent hit  dice spells are back i know we had a few characters level we had scanlan level percy  levelled and pike levelled  laura so were just gonna choose an eighthlevel for pike but it wont stick if she wants to not  have that be it /none/ right  matt yeah sure its fine as a cleric you have access to all the cleric spells  laura oh so she doesnt have to choose one like a ranger  matt no no no thats kind of the benefits of the cleric and the wizard is they have a larger  breadth of spells druids as well  laura oh thats great well never mind  liam were gonna pick power word kill green dragon  laura yeah power word kill green dragon for her eighthlevel spell  matt shes taking power word kill  liam green dragon /none/  laura specifically  marisha can she do that  laura no no  marisha okay i was just like is that allowed  liam you dont know  marisha all right all right  matt so if you guys wanna get your any attunement changes you want to situate for the  coming party company move  liam yeah i would like my boots back and ive been sort of dreading this moment can i have my  boots back  laura they look so good on me have you noticed  liam its all ive noticed for the /none/ last 24 hours when we were fighting i mean we probably  wouldve killed her yesterday but i was so distracted by how good  you looked in the boots yeah  laura i know i know  liam yeah  laura i mean like really good  liam strategically i think i can actually do more and i think im more likely to get a little  more bang for my buck out of them  laura oh really strategically you can do more than me  liam never mind ill use the sword  laura no no no /none/ ill give them to you ill give them to you  liam that was as painful as i imagined it would be  travis it couldve been worse  liam yes it couldve been percy would you like this sword back  taliesin you know  liam or anybody yeah the sword  laura its the dragonkilling sword  liam i just im better when im maneuverable and i feel like im gonna get one swing and a miss  and it go to waste  laura oh jeez who needs it can anybody take it  taliesin i will /none/ admit if i get within striking distance im probably  travis can i see it  liam sure you can heres the handle  marisha proper handling techniques  travis what really gasps ill have it  laura should i do stealth cloak or should i do  matt you guys have also taken some time to inspect the other items that you received from the  treasure hoard  laura get me out of this bench situation  marisha gimme those gimme those gimme those boots  matt boots to keyleth and this to whoever the hammer  travis /none/ the hammer theres a hammer  matt its a warhammer  travis what who found a warhammer i was asleep  laura hold on hold on ill pass it over to you im not even going to read it keyleth  taliesin chapter one  laura okay wait the dwarven thrower this is the warhammer okay you gain a 3 attack bonus  bonus to attack and damage rolls it has a thrown property normal range of 20 feet and a long range  of 60 feet grog when you hit with a ranged attack using this weapon it deals /none/ an extra 1d8  damage or if the target is giant which a dragon is 2d8 damage  matt like an actual giant  laura oh is a giant never mind immediately after the attack  the weapon flies back to your hand  liam another one of those secrets she was telling me about  matt yeah its thorhammerish does require attunement by a dwarf  travis what if ive got a dwarvish beard  matt if you have the belt of dwarvenkind attuned you can attune to the hammer as well but only  under that condition if /none/ you unattune the belt you have to unattune the hammer  liam and you have to give matt 20  travis im so happy right now  matt yes that as well i forgot that on the card  laura kerrek are you secretly a dwarf  patrick i no though the similarity is notable  laughter  liam i noticed you havent actually given me the boots back and i just wanted to remind you  laura oh my god let me find the fucking piece of paper jeez  liam its very important im also going oh you /none/ go  marisha also these boots may be good for our wonderful cleric these are boots of elvenkind  while you wear these boots your steps make no sound regardless of the surface you are moving  across you also have advantage on dexterity stealth checks that rely on moving silently  laura oh my gosh but i dont know what else pike has attuned on her  matt well that one i dont think requires attunement  laura gasps pass em over pike will wear them they dont need attune wow ill write them down  on her sheet /none/  matt but she will not have her boots of levitation or no she will not have her  sprinters boots sprinters boots will be replaced by those  liam well you know what are the chances that shes gonna need to bolt probably more than sneak  around probably  matt its a choice to make  laura okay heres a question can she have the boots on and then right before the battle put on  the sprinters boots  matt sprinters boots do require attunement  laura and its not like you can attune them and then /none/ take them off  matt ill have to doublecheck the card from her i dont know if they do  marisha sprinters boots are pretty clutch for pike  laura yeah theyre pretty clutch especially after the last time  liam were going to brawl  laura but were going stealthy probably before  matt its up to you the process of a giant armored gnome to change out her boots is gonna  be its not like a quick its not pressing the x button in your inventory  liam its like changing from one pair of ski boots /none/ into another pair of ski boots  matt essentially yeah  laughter  matt so be mindful of that  liam all right minor thing im going to attune the deathwalkers ward to necrotic  matt to necrotic okay  marisha well then hows your stealth percy  taliesin i have spiderboots  marisha oh you have spiderboots what about you grog  travis huh what was the question sorry im drooling all over this  laura do you mind can i put em on for now since i gave him back his boots is that okay  marisha yeah /none/ my stealth is pretty all right  taliesin hes got leaping boots  liam is that a thor hammer is that thing  travis its pretty fucking close apparently i throw it it comes right back to my hand if i had  frenzied rage and three attacks would it go whack whack whack like a giant yoyo  matt technically yes  travis hyperventilates im taking this one  taliesin i get it  liam how far can you throw that thing  travis 60 feet  matt well its 20 feet and then 60 feet is the second /none/ range increment so if its longer than 20  feet your attacks are at disadvantage  travis son of a bitch  matt but you can still attack  travis what if i did reckless attack  matt then it would be no more roll and then everyone gets advantage against you  travis i love you right now if these two tables werent in our way  matt love the dice that rolled that treasure hoard  liam ugh whats all over the bottom of the table after the show  travis mayonnaise  matt is there anybody else /none/ that wanted to  travis i would like to attune to this  matt to the dwarven thrower  travis yes not the blood axe  matt okay so the blood axe goes away dwarven throwers out  taliesin cabals dragonslayer animus  matt so just so youre aware the dice roll on that is a d8 to do damage as opposed to a d12  laura oh that doesnt sound as cool  travis i must think  marisha im gonna do my circlet my antlers as always ring of protection spire of conflux  matt okay  patrick /none/ just to chime in out of character i know we picked up the dancing sword which could  act as an autonomous fighting thing but i dont know who has that or who  has slots available to attune  matt that is grog has that actually  laura grog has every weapon ever  marisha is it an attunement thing  matt you have to attune to it yeah  liam youre a fallout character  matt but yes grog does have the sword  marisha do you have an extra spot kerr to attune  patrick im gonna /none/ show my age here you know i have only occasionally done 5th edition back in  the day when i got used to playing we never attuned our weapons  matt yeah you only have two things attuned you do you can  patrick so im relatively easy in terms of what magic items i could have it and set it loose at  the beginning of combat if nobody else can  travis okay  matt so grog pulls the sword out from the bag of holding and as he reaches and extends it towards  you you feel /none/ this sudden almost like a sudden burst of headache at the back of your mind and  you stop for a second grog and you look at the blade and there across the metallic sheen of this  gorgeous scimitar you see this image begin to seep through and look at you its this  femalelike face very faint a reflection  travis female setting  matt but the teeth are fanged and you see what looks to be almost like a swirl of snakes around  the outside at that moment you feel that burst of headache in the /dung/ back of your head grow  extremely strong and you drop the blade out of your hand and you guys watch as grog falls to his  knees just clutching the sides of his head the sword as it hits the ground it clacks the blade  almost immediately rusts and turns into a dark dull metal the gems crack and turn to dust and  what now lies there is an inert weapon  laura what the fuck  liam what did you do  marisha grog  travis ow  laughter  laura oh no did it turn /none/ you really really really stupid  travis that really hurt and its still hurting  marisha grog how many fingers am i holding up  travis square  taliesin well hes fine  liam that magic sword bit me that really hurt  travis what happened  laura is it just because its only meant for you  liam kerrek do you still want it  laughter  patrick do i have any idea like was this thing rejecting me or pissed  that grog was abandoning it  matt you get the sense just cause youve seen a few /none/ things like this that this was actually an  inherent curse within the blade and it just took a moment to dig itself into grog  travis oh no  matt but the source of the curse is expended and grog you are permanently at 2 to all of your  saving throws correcting my mistake from the card last session  laura oh shit  marisha this is the deck of many things  matt this was me completely either misreading or mishearing it last time as the internet let me  know that was the card drawn i /none/ want to make sure that we stick to what was drawn  travis i dont have a problem with that i do have a problem with the headache can we maybe  bargain to get the headache removed cause im really  taliesin i have tylenol but it requires attunement  laughter  travis i need bc powder  matt i think grog has a way to get rid of headaches  liam can i also say no ones gonna ever try to get away with anything here because we know were  being watched people are watching like hawks /none/ everythings going to be seen  marisha so 2 to all of his saving throws  matt yes  marisha permanently  matt well until a god takes it away  laura a god no go talk to the raven queen or somebody sarenrae gasps maybe she can greater  restoration if pike realizes what it is  travis stupid sword jeez me and swords just really not doing well  liam pike can you take a look at your buddy  laura well i dont know if i know that anythings wrong with him  grog do you have /none/ a headache  matt grog is clutching the side of his head pike just came up to you and asked you a question  travis whatd she say  laura do you have a headache  travis i do do you have anything to help with it  laura well i can maybe do like a cure wounds or  travis im not wounded its just a headache do you have cure headache  laura i dont think so but i can pray to sarenrae if it would help  travis i dont know its out of my league i /none/ mean maybe yeah  laura can i is there anything i have  matt what do you want to try  marisha pike is just universally cute shes like a kigurumi if you wear it youre just  automatically cute  laura just instacute  matt its true  laura would i know what to do would she know what to do to try to help him at all  matt if its a curse i mean there are a few things that can usually take care of a regular  curse but she doesnt understand the nature of this /none/ curse  laura okay i can try to do a i dont know what level greater restoration is  matt its a 5thlevel  travis its only a headache ill be fine  laura are you sure grog  travis yeah we all just healed im fine  laura okay let me know if you need anything though  travis all right yeah i will thank you pike  patrick coming into this fight down two on all saves  travis were gonna kick some ass oh down two thats  taliesin do we have anything sitting around thats not /none/ attuned though  liam pike got that cloak that fucking hotis glued to my flesh off thats i think what she did  marisha grog if you want also you can have my ring of protection which is a ring of protection  2 and it gives you 2 to ac and to all your saving throws i was gonna wear it but i could  wear the cloak of displacement instead  travis im not a real big jewelry fan do i have to attune to it  marisha yeah  travis nah i dont want it  marisha /none/ okay  travis thank you though keyleth thats very sweet  marisha youre welcome its a little bit of a girly ring so i understand well youre full on  attunements right youre full up  laura pikes gonna try to do greater restoration on grog  matt okay so as you guys are finishing this conversation grog and keyleth pike walks up and  holds her gauntlet out her giant awesome monsterogre gauntlet as it begins to suddenly  emit this bright white vibrant glow she touches the front of your forehead beckoning you to bend  down to /none/ try and get rid of the headache you watch as the healing energy surges through your body  from head to toe and as it passes through you the light fades the spell is spent thats a  5thlevel spell she used and the headache remains  groaning  travis did it do anything for my gas  matt there is no divine magic that can do anything about that either grog  travis son of a bitch  laura it was worth a try though because that wouldve been helpful  taliesin i cannot find my card for my /none/ ring of lightning resistance it seems to have vanished  travis i dont know where it would have gone  taliesin do we have anything else equipped that we can  laura i didnt say it the last time but trinkets out of the necklace and he healed  overnight cause hes low too  patrick actually you know kerrek is kind of standing around buffing a little bit of the rust  out of his offtherack chainmail hes trying not to look like that kid who showed up at the rich  kids party  laughter  patrick out /none/ of character i will say if anyone has anything that theyre not using in terms of  travis yeah no we do  patrick im reasonably geared up ill be able to go in and hit  taliesin are you wearing armor  matt he has chainmail  taliesin okay so the bracers of defense wouldnt work  marisha yeah would the cloak work with armor right it wouldnt replace his armor a cloak  matt no the cloak can go over armor  marisha are you okay with that vax kerr we have this cloak of displacement thats pretty /none/  awesome if you want to wear it  liam yeah its made from the flesh of a flying manta raytype thing and it makes you really hard  to hit and this is a loaner  matt its actually made from the flesh of a displacer beast  liam i know that i know i also have a very precious ring which i would love to have back from  you once weve killed this dragon but you will not be seen if you wear it  patrick i would put that to good use in the coming fight /none/  marisha okay i take the cloak and i throw it over him you gonna tweet it to him or text it to  him whatever  liam and i slap the ring down into his palm  marisha do you have a picture of the ring  liam a picture of the ring  laura its a ring of invisibility  marisha do you have a thing no  liam yes i have a thing  laura just a legendary ring  matt just a legendary ring like you do just note with the ring of invisibility you remain /none/  invisible until the ring is removed until you attack or cast a spell or until you use a bonus  action to become visible again  liam if anyone has anything better to give him we could do that  laura no thats really good thats a badass ring  liam hey siri remind me to ask patrick rothfuss for my ring of invisibility back once the dragon  is dead were good  matt all right there you go thank you siri  laughter  travis assisting dd games since 2000something  matt all right so what else /none/ do you guys want to prepare if anything as you wake up come to  consciousness  laura we should have a heroes feast  marisha yes we should  laura is there anybody that could do a heroes feast  marisha pike how are you looking on feasts  matt i mean if pike wants to prepare a heroes feast pike can cast it  marisha can gilmore  liam that was a onetime thing  matt gilmore had a few items that basically turned into a heroes feast  but he lost his shop  laura okay okay /none/ okay pike can do another what level is that  matt heroes feast it is i believe 6thlevel i think yes 6thlevel  travis whyre we having a feast are we going to fight something  taliesin its breakfast its the most important meal of the day  travis thats right i feel terrible for not realizing that  laura okay so we all have heroes feast  matt all right so mark your diamond that you recently found in the hoard marked off as pike  prepares a long wooden table summoned through divine magic that contains a fantastic /none/ meal of  all the classic westruun comfort foods instilled with the power and guidance of sarenrae as you  spend the additional hour to eat and drink and gain the effect of the spell you become immune to  poison immune to fear and you all get an additional 2d10 to your maximum hit points if you  want to roll that laura  laura for pike  matt yes well this is for everybody everybody gets this amount  laura oh thats not bad thats not bad thats a 15 added for everybody  matt so everybody gets /none/ 15 additional hit points  marisha and im assuming trinket is eating and allura is eating  matt it can feed up to 12 people so yes that would be kerr as well and allura and kima  taliesin we get advantage on what saves  laura fear and poison  matt well youre immune to fear and immune to poison  taliesin we dont get advantage  laura advantage on wisdom  matt wisdom saving throws all righty  laura and i attuned by the way my bracers of archery are attuned again  matt you reattuned to your /none/ bracers of archery cool all righty so  marisha should i do a scrying eye see if i can still find raishan  laura yeah but what should you scry on can you scry on thordaks body or something cause she  would have it right next to her  marisha can i  taliesin we have the ball  matt its either a creature or location  patrick well if right now were pretty sure that they dont know we know where they are do we want  to risk that losing the surprise  marisha we dont if /dung/ i scry on her cave would that tip her off the cave of opash  matt only one way to find out  marisha only one way to find out  taliesin im of the opinion that personally i think its safer to know what we know now and go  in because if things  marisha i mean i can always teleport us there and scry there that way at least minutes  matt as far as you know when you create a sensor at a location creatures that can see invisibility  can see the actual scrying location /none/ the orb itself that you create the magical orb of which  your vision appears through but thats the only thing you would have to consider  marisha thats a massive thing to consider  travis unless shes in like permabubblebath world or something  liam we should just go  marisha i think we should too  laura oh jeez im so nervous  marisha i know  travis im not  taliesin im feeling strangely positive  travis 2 playas  liam would you put that piece of wood down please  laura hes eating wood again  /town/ marisha we need to get him another salt lick  travis i do miss my salt lick rock can i keep an eye out as we walk  around for another salt lick rock  matt make a perception check  travis dont make me do that ooh  taliesin god the sound those things make  travis 13  taliesin its like your dice have a subwoofer  matt you find a few separate pieces of what look like quartzlike rock that line the sides of the  road and the exterior garden of the castle and upon trying /none/ each one not as salty as youd hoped  theyre generally just bits of whitestone or rock  marisha grog thats caca  travis find your own  taliesin let him lick it if he wants it its just gonna make him happy  travis is it close to salty could i confuse it with salt  matt i mean you get a hint of salt but its gone after the first lick  travis more shiny than the others  matt after licking it a few times it gets a little shinier yeah  travis i am a great /none/ sorcerer i will keep this new stone  matt okay so go ahead and mark three quartz rocks  travis palmsized  matt roughly some are a little bigger the center one is a little bit  like a basketball size  travis bag of holding youve got new occupants  marisha putting rocks in the bag of holding just filling it with rocks  laura rocks and like dried poo  matt dont judge his collection  marisha ox oxen troll dicks pet rocks just a bunch of pet rocks  matt all right as you guys are preparing /none/ kima and allura catch up to you guys theyve gathered  their materials and theyre prepped for battle kimas fully armored  marisha does she look badass in her full sorceress armor  matt oh allura  marisha paint a picture whats she look like  laughter  marisha shes an uppermiddleclass girl  matt shes wearing one of her many ceremonial robes that she does for presentory taldorei  council work but you see she has a hood up over her head her hair braids are tied together behind  her neck so they dont get in the way /none/ you notice that there is some really nice jewelry thats  adorning the side of her neck the staff she carries with her usually is relatively simple but  you see now that there are a number of runes carved in a spiral along the sides of it you can  see a number of rings that she previously wasnt wearing that are on and her face is hardened and  you see that she where normally she has this air of keeping the room almost a teacher or  parentaltype presence in the area theres an intensity and darkness /none/ to her face that you  havent really seen before not since at least the attack on the city happened  liam work  laura sings allura  matt sings and kima  travis oh my god  matt all right guys so theyve arrived and allura steps into the room her staff clicking  across the stone floor of the castle all right have we put all of our affairs in order  travis yes  taliesin well i hate when you put it that way  laura kima got the feast too right  matt they come in /none/ towards the beginning of the casting of the feast and they eat as well yes  taliesin its a buffet its a heroes buffet  matt so how best should we arrive if you have the ability to bring us through the tree or i can  teleport us there  laura is it the same difference  marisha what power how much energy do you use when you teleport  matt as far as the advancement of spell strength a teleport spell in its own right is the  seventh sphere of magical incantation  marisha mm then let /none/ me go with our transport via plants which is more of a six you know level  matt sounds like a wondrous idea  taliesin worstcase scenario we can camp for the night if are victorious and spent  travis i love camping  marisha yeah it looks like a very pretty island  taliesin lets make sure that one of the gate stones is left here in case one of us has to make  a mad dash  marisha give it to cassandra  taliesin give it obviously keep it in cassandras care if somebody comes back you /none/ know  everythings gone horribly wrong  matt kima rushes over and takes the stone from your hand and goes all right ill give it to  her be right back she jogs off you hear the clanging of the armor as she disappears  taliesin maybe we should give  taliesin and marisha  her the boots  marisha thats not a bad call  laura thats true  matt so  laura yeah yeah you know what when kima comes back im gonna give her the elven boots so she  can be quiet  matt she takes /none/ them and is like not really my style  laura if you dont want them ill wear them i mean i like them a lot  im just saying youre loud  matt ill take em and you all wait patiently for the next six minutes as she unbuckles and  pulls off the rest of her lower armor and gets the boots on  travis that dont match at all  matt no and you can see it gives her a twinge of disappointment  marisha its like different tiered armors in warcraft its the worst  liam slips /none/ her doc martens over here  matt the expansion just came out so its like all epics and one green thats better than the  rest yeah thats the worst laughs all right with you all gathered there allura hood still  up kind of nods keyleth lead the way to the sun tree then  marisha to the sun tree  matt very well sighs let us hope that we return here tomorrow victorious she swirls  around her cloak spinning around her base as she follows suit after you keyleth the rest of you  make your way /town/ marching down the front of castle whitestone to the center of the town where there  you see the faint elements of green bloom now growing across the tree from where once it was  bare the season bringing a sense of spring and summer that have been kept at bay for a while and  for you as well percival this is the first time in a long time youve seen the sun tree showing  that growing life  taliesin i quietly sneak up and give it a good kiss  marisha aw i see it and im /none/ like you know i know him i can put in a good word  taliesin really we talk all the time he never mentions you  marisha what what im gonna let that go  laughter  marisha that could be a discussion i dont wanna do that right now well talk later  are we ready  matt all right so what are you focusing on for the receiving end of this  marisha im assuming i found a tree that was close to her cavern thats big enough  matt with the second scrying that you did with /none/ allura which was just specifically the island of  viscan you did see a number of trees not far from the rocky protrusion the small mountain that  seemed to be the place where this laboratorys in so yes you can choose one of those trees you saw  that would be large enough to do it  marisha okay  taliesin scanlan stops us before we start for the record this is a terrible idea and we have no  plan just putting it out there im with you this is a terrible plan and were going to die /none/  laura you seem different  taliesin im fine i have a cold i dont feel well im taking something for it  travis sing me a song sing me a song right now  taliesin im not singing  marisha i try to stealthily sniff scanlan does he smell like  matt laughing well first roll a stealth check  laughter  travis dont ever say the word  marisha okay 14  matt 14 the notstealthyatall keyleth slowly approaches you you see her you make eye contact  and yet she still slowly crawls up and begins taking /none/ a big whiff on your shoulder  marisha sniffs ah so nervous  taliesin there once was a barbarian named grog who had the iq of a log id keep going but now  youre excited and youve made me lose my  travis that was amazing  marisha does he smell like the incense that i smelled from him before  matt no he smells of frustration disappointment and worry  marisha you smell like a sad man all right lets go  matt laughs all right so do you go ahead and cast the spell all right  /none/ marisha i say to the sun tree i say i like your new haircut i have a new one too  okay lets go  laura i cast pass without a trace on all of us before we go through the tree  matt okay so as the shadows coalesce around your bodies your legs your knees your feet you  watch as the front of the sun tree suddenly splits open to reveal the pathway through across to what  looks to be a partially ruined jungle you all step through the tree quickly before the portal  slams /none/ shut behind you and as you guys emerge looking about you can see what looks to be a lot  of heavy dirt and earth that theres spatterings of sand throughout and surrounding it  immediately you can see there are different trees throughout this kind of some points are lush  green jungle on the outside and the further in you go you watch as the trees have all withered  black a little ways over the treeline you can see maybe a quartermile off what looks to be the  top of the mountain that a brief instant /none/ of your first vision in your scry spell lent you towards  marisha does it look like the blight of the trees is getting more concentrated the closer to the top  of the mountain  matt it looks like its a radial effect from the actual mountain yes  travis does it look like fire damage or something else  matt you want to go ahead and take a look make an investigation check  travis yeah stand back 11 minus two  matt laughs you cant recall the color really that theyve become but its not alive  /none/ travis someone peed on these trees all of em in a big circle like that  marisha grog is this what happens when you pee on trees  travis is that not normal  marisha we should talk with pike when we get home make sure youre okay  laura oh do you need me to cast another greater restoration for your  marisha no his bladder infections fine  laura okay  taliesin it can keep  matt it takes a wish spell to get rid of that unfortunately  liam hes been in every brothel in taldorei its /none/ to be expected  laughter  travis not ashamed  laura he and scanlan both  marisha did he find anything out did you find anything out  matt no he didnt find anything  marisha can i do a nature check  matt sure go for it  travis these trees arent alive  marisha fancy that thats good 21  matt okay as you guys begin to walk through its not a very dense jungle  laura we want to keep quiet as we do it  matt okay so make stealth checks as well  marisha we /none/ have pass without a trace  matt yes you do so plus ten to all your stealth  marisha natural 20  marisha and laura pewpewpew  marisha if only it mattered right now pewpewpew  matt all righty and a natural 20 for allura and actually i rolled with disadvantage for  kima and it was like a 16 and a four but then she had the boots on so the first one sticks  laura 24 for pike  matt nice so stealthily you guys what did you roll  taliesin i rolled 33 and scanlan rolled 31 /none/  matt grog  travis 13  taliesin plus ten  travis yep  taliesin okay  matt with the plus ten  travis yep  taliesin how did you do that  matt okay well kerr what did you get  patrick 14 for me  laura plus ten  patrick where did that plus ten come from  laura from pass without a trace  matt a spell that she had cast on all of you  patrick then i am at 24  cheering  laura 38  marisha 37  matt as you guys fan out /none/ in this  computer chime  taliesin now boarding star tours  marisha thanks for that microsoft outlook  matt as you begin to weave your way through these trees as quietly as you possibly can keyleth you  step behind and run your fingers along some of these withered grey and black fronds and branches  all these trees look like they had the life force pulled from them almost like a very very rapid  starvation or thirst took them but whats interesting is a lot of these trees are  nearpetrified and have been this way for /none/ a very long time  marisha that was gonna be my question  matt its not a recent occurrence  marisha so like the petrified forest in arizona  matt kind of yeah but a sadder version if thats possible theyre all like  ehh im a bad tree  taliesin what do i know about opash and the crimes and what sort of tinkering  matt you dont know that much the fact that you knew the name and a little bit of the history was  even impressive by the standards of everyone here what little you do /none/ know is that he was sent away  specifically because of his inquiries into how far you can reach with necromantic magics and lost  history from the age of arcanum  taliesin okay thats good to know  matt the age of arcanum was the epoch before the divergence before the calamity hit and not a lot  of history exists about it a lot of it was destroyed either during the battle or people  destroyed it thereafter to prevent us from reusing what led to that sort of conflict but opash  apparently had gathered or at /none/ least was in the process of trying to recover some of that  information  marisha so these trees have been dead for hundreds of years  matt hundreds of years yes  marisha all right  taliesin so the scarring does not seem recent  marisha and theres no new scarring  matt there does not appear to be any new scarring that you can tell based on  what youve seen so far  marisha thats very good  laura do i see any sign of tracks or anything dragon tracks  matt go ahead and make an /none/ investigation check  laura dragging of giant carcasses or just yknow footprints  taliesin yellow dragon crossing signs  laura advantage cause its a dragon  matt if its dragonrelated  laura it is dragonrelated natural 20  matt all righty there are no dragon tracks  laura motherfucker  taliesin she licks a tree no dragon has been here  laughter  laura i bet theres other tracks though that i totally missed cause i was looking for dragons  matt yes  laura can i look for anything other than dragons there wont be an advantage  matt /none/ go for it sure  laura i really want that 20 but i dont get it this one is not as good is this an  investigation perception  matt yeah this would be investigation for you sitting down and getting close and looking  throughout the dirt  laura whispers 11  matt 11 you do find tracks but theyre scattered and theyre small feet looks like some  indigenous creatures or wildlife that exists on this landscape  laura okay but they were little  matt they were all little yeah as you guys push through allura looks /none/ up toward the boughs of the  dead trees while you were preparing i did some research on this island and it seems that there  were an indigenous people that lived here before opash came thousands that made seaward trade  routes to the north and the west and when he made this his home the indigenous people were never  heard from again it is believed by many who fare the seas that this land is cursed and is to be  avoided for that reason this forest one of the superstitious points of that reasoning there are /none/  a few that come through hoping to scavenge or find things from his lost whereabouts or his own hoard  or treasures he may have garnished in his time but few of those return as well  taliesin well if raishan came back then who knows what horrors actually do exist on this  island its possible that she found some of his notes and built upon them  there could be anything  marisha did you read if the island was trapped or any type of arcane presence on it  matt well if this was the lair /none/ of a necromancer an entity that is both selfish and  driven towards the personal power and advancement of their own narcissism i can imagine that they  are very well protected with their secrets the fact that this abode was taken by thordak before  he made reign upon the southern side of the continent who knows what happened to opash  marisha thordak made this his abode  matt yes up until he began to wander onto the continent of taldorei  taliesin interesting  laura mmhm  taliesin im just playing some conjecture in my head you /dung/ have a powerful necromancer if theres  any possibility that he couldve found a semblance of unlife of opash wandering around and bent him  towards his will then we dont know how that gem got into his chest in the first place we dont  know how any of this happened and theres just too much we dont know yet  we have to find the cave  matt the gem we created me kima drake as far as we know if any of her stories can be believed  raishan was responsible for the rituals that embedded it /none/ within thordaks chest on the  plane of fire during her time with the fire ashari once again as much as we can believe  taliesin theres just a lot we dont know  matt let us be careful press on  laura tread carefully just keep an eye out were keeping eyes out for anything that looks  different than normal jungleness  liam you and i head out 20 feet ahead of everybody and check for traps as we go  carefully  matt investigation checks from both you guys if you dont mind  liam investigation or /none/  matt if youre looking for traps specifically investigation  laura 26  liam 18  matt okay pushing forward you guys  laura i wasnt just looking for traps im looking for anything that looks out of place in  the forest cause i dont know what kind of traps necessarily would be set by something like this  you know what i mean  matt sure in a very laura bailey how much can i get out of this roll i know i know i know im  just messing with you so as you guys push forward /none/ you vax notice that the further in you  go towards this mountain the trees still dead grey are even further withered and many of them  have just turned to ash and dust and the closer you get the actual treeline grows thinner and  lower as it seems like the closer it gets to the mountain theyre bereft of most of their  structure you do vex catch as your brother is moving forward he is stepping towards a section  of the earth and sand that has slightly different texture eversoslightly from the rest and hes  /dung/ but a few feet from stepping into that space  laura vax stop theres some weirdness on the ground i feel like its something  liam so you think somethings up under the ground there  laura yeah  liam i mean what do i do at this point  matt what do you want to do you look down and you  laura dont you see it  matt it looks almost like  liam im gonna take a closer look is what im gonna do  matt it looks like the difference between sand and slightly damp sand /none/ the coloration is just  ever so faintly  laura now that youre looking now that youre looking you can tell right  liam now that i have context context is key as always  travis can i push him in no im kidding  laura is it quicksand  liam do i find a trap if im looking closer now with her added  matt i mean it looks different from the rest theres no mechanism there you dont see a pulley  or a  laura maybe its magic  liam how much of it looks different  /dung/ matt its avoidable its like a ten 15foot oval area  laura hey everyone lets just not step on this dark patch how about that  travis why  laura cause i think its like magic or something grog  travis like good magic  laura like bad magic  travis what kind of bad magic  laura the kind that would kill us all  marisha like the kind that gives you a really bad headache  travis i really dont want another one of those  laura similar sort of thing  liam continue  matt now that /none/ youve identified that youve come across a few more patches and they seem to grow  more dense as the trees grow more withered and gone until you get to a point where you can now  see the base of this mountain  marisha can i from a distance maybe do a nature check are these almost like siphons like wells  where he was sucking the life force  matt make a nature check  taliesin or maybe quicksand this could be all the quicksand we were promised as children  laura i know right  marisha oh /none/ my gosh always quicksand  travis seriously todays kids do not appreciate quicksand  taliesin it was such a big part of my childhood  marisha why did i never find quicksand 22  matt 22 these are less siphons theyre more what looks to be its a phenomenon known as  hollow earth which is when subterranean caverns go into collapse  liam sinkholes  matt it can create a sinkholelike phenomenon but hollow earth generally is based on some sort  of magical release an explosion of magical energy beneath the earth that causes even though there  /none/ is no space it erodes the earth from its magic presence whether it just completely disintegrates  or destroys portions of the earth it leaves this very very unstable portion of ground  marisha so its like a magical quasar that blasts out  matt youre not entirely certain what itll do but its not good  travis i take one of my new salt lick rocks and i throw it in one of the little sandy pools  matt okay as you take the rock and throw it into the sandy pool it lands with a little bit of /none/ dirt  being kicked up around it and sits there for a rest  travis ooh magic huh real scary  laura and then  taliesin would the rock tell you if it was having a headache right now how would it tell you that  travis i have a psychic connection with my rocks  liam you also weigh a little more  matt the rock then goes it just falls underneath and you can see a spot in the ground  perfectly shaped where the rock was that is now just  laura told you it was dangerous /none/  travis i actually did that its magic  laura good job grog  travis dont step there  marisha you figured it out grog good job  taliesin weird point of contention for my imagination are the trees wilting or do they  seem like there was a bit of a blast  matt they are not leaning a specific direction  taliesin okay so theres no pattern to it  matt yeah and it isnt like there are were leaves or anything blown off of them it just  looked like they gradually just died rapidly in place /none/  liam seems like the closer we get the deader it gets  laura can we see the mountain that were getting towards  matt yes you can and you guys maneuver around these spaces to get to the base of it and its a  moderatesized mountain nothing impressive on the outside its maybe 600 feet tall at its apex  its more of a large rocky mound make a perception check  liam natural 20  matt theres nothing in here why do i keep trying to sip  laura 30 is what i rolled but thats not /dung/ as good as a natural 20  liam no its not  laura but 30 is still good  matt but whats your bonus to perception  liam perception oh yeah is 12 so 32  matt okay so close you guys being at the front of the party anyway  laura whoa your perception bonus is higher than mine when did that happen  taliesin how did you just notice that  liam who fucking knows  matt as you guys scoot forward being ahead of the rest of the party you glance across the  surface of this /none/ and most of the rock follows the familiar pattern of tectonic shift thats broken  and cracked in places but its been over hundreds and thousands of years just settled into  its natural state there is one section of rock just maybe 200 feet from where you are landing at  the base where it looks like the texture the natural lines of the rock is in a different  direction and upon you heading in that direction you can see now what it appears to be is a large  rock very large maybe 20 30 feet wide /none/ that is jammed into an entranceway  liam i perceive a rock  marisha i got a rock  matt kind of there are a number of strange holes peppered over the surface  laura like big holes  matt about the size of a larger than a gold piece each hole  laura does it look like it could be like things could come out of it  matt possibly  liam checking for traps  matt you have to check it  travis you know what gilmore would do put his hand in it  taliesin how very /none/ flash gordon  liam 25 for investigation  matt investigation okay  laura do i need to roll since hes so good  liam might as well  laura what if its a one ooh no 24 damn  travis got you a water matt  matt thank you sir so are the rest of you guys following up behind them  liam just wait a moment wait a moment no hang back for a second  matt okay between the two of you glancing you notice that each one of these holes is actually a  pierced intrusion upon /none/ the rock something very quickly jammed itself into the rock to create this  hole and theyre clustered in places and you with your experience these claws are respective  to the size of a very very very large dragon and it looks like different some of them are  more weathered than others this boulder has been placed and pulled back and placed many many times  throughout the years  laura its probably too heavy for us to move but grog do you want to try  taliesin i dont know if we should move it  laura /none/ well how do we get in if we dont open the entrance  patrick if nothing else rather than moving the whole boulder is there a way we could just get  enough of a crack to get in  marisha i can stone shape it a little bit thinner  laura ooh dig i like that  taliesin just so that if the dragon tries to run they have to move a giant boulder it would be  really convenient  laura oh good call  marisha does it look like theres am i there im not there yet /none/  matt you guys are hanging back  liam kik  marisha all right ill go up is there a crack that looks like it can kind of just whittle it  away thats kind of already started with the boulder  matt i mean the boulder is larger than the entranceway that its jammed into and youre not  entirely certain what the inside of this cavern mouth is if its just a direct intersection point  or if its a gradual influx you can just try and push through at  one of those points if youd like /none/  laura can you just put a hole in the middle like right in the center of the boulder  on the ground  taliesin or would it be easier just to scrape across the side  marisha i only have a limited amount of space that i can carve out so the boulder might be too  thick but if i do it at the seam line i should be able to do it i want to do it at the seam  travis do we want to take the first entrance that we find i mean is it /none/ really one way in one way  out what if its just like a trap  marisha does someone want to check for traps  matt they already checked it did not appear to be trapped just a very very heavy rock  travis i mean like run a perimeter do any recon anything else  laura wed have to run around an entire mountain does it look like there  could be any other entrances  matt i mean youd have to go around the entire mountain  laura how long would it take if i flew around  /none/ matt oh maybe at full speed hour and a half two hours  travis fuck that death first open the door  laura all right cool cool cool lets just shape the boulder  marisha do i want to scry on the inside or are we just going in do i want to scry and see if  shes there  matt this accounts for you flying stopping checking flying stopping checking you cant  just check for traps while going by at 50 feet around  taliesin scrying on the inside  matt are you gonna scry  marisha /none/ are we just going in  travis yeah were doing it  taliesin i think well just go in i mean what are we gonna see thats gonna  make us change our mind  laura and marisha well if shes not there  laura gasps oh im gonna try to detect dragons what the fuck  marisha yeah thats better  laura i sit down and go hmm  travis do you have a headache too oh my god were all gonna die im patient zero  patrick if im up by the boulder too i will do i /none/ dont have a huge range but i will do  divine sense  matt okay  patrick i can detect all manner of stuff up to 60 feet  matt yes you can all righty so using your divine sense lets see here okay so you spend  your time just focusing making sure theres nothing either in or in the immediate vicinity of  the rock boulder that could be of celestial fiend or undead nature while you spend a spell  slot to do your primeval awareness so yes you do sense what appear to be three sources /none/ of dragon  life force within the space roughly in the direction of this mountain and below  laura theyre here theyre here oh god hyperventilates theyre here shes still here  and i think the eggs are okay cause i can still feel like theres dragons  marisha oh theyre still alive  laura i think so  marisha god damn it god okay all right  laura i just did it within a mile so is that okay was that within a mile  matt i believe its  laura or did i need to spend longer  /none/ matt for that one it is for one minute per level of the spell and its within one mile up to six  miles if youre in your favored terrain  laura oh so i am because its woods right wooded  matt its not wooded anymore so its one mile so you know at least theyre within a mile  marisha thats big  taliesin thats huge  marisha all right  liam so this is happening  marisha does anyone need to do anything else before we go in  laura i have to go take a poo /none/  marisha i have to pee too i have to pee so bad  laughter  matt was that in character  marisha its both  laura im so nervous  marisha little bit of both  laura all right  matt so whats the plan guys  laura were gonna go in lets go in  marisha does anyone need to do a thing  laura i mean i dont know if were gonna have to go through and it only lasts for a minute so i  feel like were gonna be in the caves longer than  /none/ marisha okay okay okay  laura so were still stealthing  travis wait actually can i pull vex aside real quick can i talk to you  just real fast before we  laura me  travis yeah like a little further away like in private  laura grog im already seeing someone  travis no i know i hate to beat a dead bush horse cow i hate to beat a dead cow but i  really did like that little magic thing i found  laura what little magic thing darling  travis when we were looting and /none/ stuff and ive been really worried about you i know you like to  bargain right so i thought i could trade you back for what i found and i have this little  parapet of wound closure youve been dying so much right and if you wear this and you die you  immediately stabilize on your next turn i figured itd be a good trade  laura do i have to attune to that grog  travis no  laura youre lying  travis its a big word i dont really know what youre saying i really liked /none/ it i mean it made  a magic sword when i touched it  laura grog and then it gave you a headache  travis yeah but i can deal with a headache i wont i just i found it you know  laura grog yells grog  travis what  laura this is awful no its so bad for you  travis look you wont die you wont die  laura laughing you motherfucker  travis its only cause im looking out for you  laura oh my god  liam its the wedding all over again  laura /none/ you see how hard this is when people want their boots back when people  want their decks back  liam dont compare the boots to the deck are you kidding me  laura you did find it  taliesin technically its somebody elses  liam what do you care what he says  laura grog you have to promise me you wont pull anything from it all you can do is hold onto it  thats all you can do you cant look at anything you have to keep it in its little pouch  travis okay yeah i /none/ dont look at anything i keep it in its little pouch i dont pull  anything i promise  laura so you know in guardians of the galaxy when he gives him that little ball at the end  matt yeah  laura can i do that can i give him a pouch heres your cards back but dont look at them  grog theyre really dangerous all right  travis you want to trade  laura yeah give me the necklace  travis okay there i take the cards  matt okay so what are you giving him  /none/ laura a little pouch thats the shape of the deck of cards  matt how do you make the pouch the shape of cards  laura its maybe not that good of a pouch but its grog  matt make a sleightofhand check with disadvantage  laura okay  taliesin aw man  liam yeah everybody saw through it immediately just so you know  laura well obviously but its grog thats really bad hes gonna be able to tell nine  matt go ahead and roll a perception check grog  travis six  taliesin yes  matt the /none/ trade is complete she hands you your deck of cards she takes her  parapet of wound closure  laura oh my god im in so much trouble  laughter  patrick i like to think that theres a live kitten in this pouch  laughter  matt if you pull the right card yeah  liam well you saved the party but your marriage is in jeopardy  laura i know hes so mad at me hes so mad its really good that hes sitting over at the  other table right now  taliesin im gonna get the /none/ wrath of this  marisha i know we have him  taliesin i can feel the heat emanating right now  matt so feeling satisfied that your imploring of vex and a trade youve made your shiny package of  happy cards are back in your possession but you promised at the moment at least  travis to not look at them all right  matt while shes right there in front of you yeah  travis thank you vex that really means the world  laura seriously though theyre really really dangerous  travis i know theyre really special /none/ i wont look at them or anything that means a lot i  dont find a lot of great things i did find a couple rocks earlier if you want them  laura oh theyre yours  travis okay are you sure youre not gonna try and steal that shit too  laura no i promise  travis cool lets go kill a dragon and i jauntily and cheerily walk back to the group  laughter  liam he looks happy what was that about  laura nervous laughter oh i just gave him back his cards is all  /none/ travis so happy to be reunited  taliesin im so proud of you  matt all right so what are the rest of you doing in the meantime  marisha youve got a little bead of sweat on your forehead vex its such a humid jungle  liam we zoom in on the single drop  marisha im waiting to sculpt a hole in the door  matt okay so using stone shape you can a section of stone no more than five feet in any  dimension and form in any shape that suits your purpose so you can /none/ make a small passage as long  as it is no more than five feet thick the wall and the stone are both thicker than five feet you  can begin to make a slight passageway you can create enough of a crack with your spell as it  completes which mark off your 4thlevel spell but as you create it you do manage to pierce and  you can look into the darkness of the tunnel behind but through the full use of the spell you  create this kind of tunnel intrusion into the side of this mountain /dung/ and you only  get that much of opening  marisha son of a bitch  taliesin no this is an excellent start  marisha all right in spelunkerkeyleth mode im looking through the hole with my darkvision  matt okay perception check  marisha what do i see  liam fanart please  matt keyleth in the descent  marisha oh son of a bitch thats a one  laura what do you see keyleth  liam you just got james francod  marisha its so fucking dark you guys  laura how about i try oh what if /none/ we light an arrow can i do an oracle arrow through the hole  marisha i shimmy out and say vex go in the hole  matt okay all right so you pull back the arrow you fire it through the arrow go ahead and make  an attack roll  laura im getting death looks natural 20  matt you fire the oracle arrow at just the right angle where it doesnt hit any of the walls it  just arcs off straight before it eventually begins to curve and what you do as you pass along  with /none/ this arrow with your darkvision you can see down the tunnel there is no light source  there is a layer of untouched dust all across the ground and interesting texture the further in you  go and then eventually about 100 feet or so in the tunnel begins to curve to the left and descend  before the arrow lands and sticks into the rock there splintering a little bit and your vision  now sits there with the arrow there doesnt appear to be any movement it is silent and  pitchblack  laura okay and nothing had /none/ walked it didnt look like there were any tracks  it was just heavy dust  matt from what you could see from the arrow rushing past it yeah  liam and that gap is just this much  matt its about that big yeah  liam and does it go in like that like a long tunnel of that or is it  could i reach my arm through  matt you could reach your arm through essentially its like the edge of the wall of  this tunnel and the rock were kind of jammed together and she /none/ punched through just enough to  push past where the rock and the wall had hit and it created this slight opening but theres still  a bunch of stone there  liam shit  taliesin its okay theres options  laura i shimmy out its just a tunnel  taliesin thats good  laura yeah its a long tunnel  patrick that means we could make a little bit of noise getting in here maybe  laura potentially raishan i think has rather good hearing if we make a lot of noise it might  echo down  patrick /none/ right  taliesin we have no way of keeping silent do we we dont have any way of  marisha i could try like what you said i can always worstcase scenario burn another  4thlevel to finish this off  travis for a door  taliesin weve spent more opening a door  marisha yes we have  travis we dont have to spend anything ill just beat the shit out of it  taliesin youre our last resort at this point  laura but you do have siege gauntlets though  travis i do yeah i actually have /dung/ those like no ones taken them from me  laughter  liam why do you say that right now how is that relevant to the conversation at hand  travis i just mean like theyre mine you know they work for me they speak to me yeah  liam ive always said as much  marisha do you have a relationship with all of your inanimate objects  travis i try to work on it at night  marisha sure  taliesin wow i actually do blame myself for this this is interesting  marisha why would you say that /none/ percy  taliesin i dont know  marisha man i feel like theres a lot of secrets  laura what do you think should we burn another 4th or should we have grog punch the little hole  a little bit  marisha well let me see i crawl back in the hole  matt okay  marisha all right  matt all right  marisha you know how like a blade of grass can break a block of concrete  laura what  marisha im doing some monk shit all right  laughter  marisha okay go with me /none/ okay you know how plants can break stone when they grow through if  i do a druidcraft cantrip and try and grow some plants through this hole will it maybe help crack  open a bigger hole  travis can you fastforward 1000 years  matt creeper hissing  marisha no creeper no creeper okay i shimmy back out and i say no apparently that takes like  1000 years  laughter  laura grog you wanna go punch some shit  patrick hold on for one second i know you can move this stone if it allows you /none/ to only move certain parts  of it could you use the stone you can shape to effectively carve out a chunk that could be pulled  out like a very thin narrow like just move as much as a fingerswidth around and then we could  pull that out instead of just pushing it all the way like clay  matt i mean it could be but one spells already been spent  laura so it would just be another spell slot  matt but it would work  patrick it would be another spell but that would be /none/ just two to get in as opposed to endlessly  throwing spell after spell at this  laura well grog has siege gauntlets so he could potentially do some damage to the rock but it  would make noise  liam one second percy i have a nutball idea that maybe you could turn into a better one  laura doors  liam i pull out the oil of etherealness that ive been carrying for ages  marisha the what of whatness  liam this its goop you rub it on yourself and you become ethereal for an hour  /none/ but i cant do it  laura why  liam theres not enough to cover me but scanlan could do it or pike could do it and could walk  through the rock  laura and then do what  liam look around see if theres anything to i dont know i prefaced it with saying it was a  shitty idea and i spoke to the brain to see if he could come up with something better  travis we looked for a switch right  marisha its a giant rock its a boulder  taliesin with handholds on /none/ it its fortress of solitude  travis can i look for a switch  matt make an investigation check  travis if i solve this 19 oh minus 17  matt 17 looking around as theyre having this conversation theres no switches but you do see  fingerholds like big dragonsized fingerholds like something grabbed it and jammed this boulder  in there  patrick i actually want to kind of take a look around too because if this is a naturally formed  rock a naturally formed opening this is not like a cork in a bottle there has /none/ to be some parts  that dont fit really smoothly have we found the best place to make our incursion is there an  opening is there any this cant fit snugly into this unless its been shaped for that purpose  taliesin we can now get enough of a hold to make a lever and move the boulder out a little bit get  us all in and then drop it back into place in theory we have this hole now thats big enough  for lets say a magical weapon that cant be destroyed and we can just /none/ apply as much pressure  put a bunch of other people pushing on the other side and see if we can open it up enough to get in  and then let it close behind us  liam how would bigby be in this situation  marisha bigby would be an upperlevel spell  taliesin i dont want to burn that right now  marisha grog do you want to try and use some of your basic mechanics of physics of leveraging  travis i dont know what that is but i will assault this stone with a quickness  /none/ laura do it just get us in  marisha dont assault it dont insul dont insult or assault it if you could just  travis theres no joy in either of them  marisha i know i know this one isnt for you  taliesin whos got a magical weapon thats very long  travis kima  marisha if you could take kimas sword pry open a crack let us slip in  travis you ask kima for the holy avenger im not taking that  marisha well dont you have the dragon sword  travis you ask kima for /none/ her sword see how that goes  taliesin kima  matt yes  taliesin were thinking about building a giant lever could you put your sword in that hole and  help us pull very very hard to see if we can move this boulder  matt will it damage the sword  taliesin in theory no  laura in theory  taliesin its a magical sword can you break a magical sword with pressure  matt you ding it you pay  taliesin thats fair so im going to try and build this lever all of us are going /none/ to  put pressure in the other direction were going to try and have as many of us moving this thing  just a couple feet not far just far enough to make an opening to get as many of us through as  possible  matt all right so whos doing the leverage  liam pike is  laura and marisha definitely pike  matt okay well the size of the sword at most its going to be one person assisting the main  person which would be pike assisting grog all right so as the rest of you /none/ guys get on the other  side grog i want you to go ahead and roll a strength check  marisha pike and grog pike and grog  matt with advantage because of pikes aid on this  travis thank god 23  matt 23 okay as you guys get on the other side before you even start getting into position grog  already begins to pull back on the sword you watch as kima keeps glancing over her shoulder  like worried noise waiting for it to just snap but the large rock the boulder begins to shift  /none/ eversoslightly you watch as dust and other small pebbles begin to clatter down the outside of  the rock you all get on the other side and all together as a group  everyone else make strength checks  patrick we can use the rod of immobility to brace it if we need to  laura yeah thats a good call because we have two of them now  marisha oh thats such a good idea  taliesin we have holes drilled in the stone by dragon feet  marisha we can just wedge it in there yeah thats a /none/ good call you guys wait were all  doing a strength check  laura 12  marisha just straight strength  matt straight strength so add your strength modifier  taliesin 17  marisha 13  liam 16  laura did you want pikes  liam to do what help prop it up  taliesin scanlan rolled a four  matt okay okay so you manage to get about a foot and a half  laura trinket rolled a 19  matt okay so trinkets also pushing as well there isnt a whole lot of surface area here to  /none/ really aid its mostly on you grog and you manage to get about a foot and a half wide before  you pull out the immovable rods and kerrek and anybody else who wants to help you manage to jam  them into two of the fingerholes and as soon as they lock in you can release the weapon and its just  enough to hold it in place although it is slowly moving each rod can only hold 8000 pounds mind  you its not holding it entirely aloft it seems to be holding okay for now  liam /none/ i immediately throw whisper through the crack and bamf through  taliesin i scootch  laura i scootch  matt you guys all pull through kima immediately rushes and grabs the sword you guys charge into  the darkness  laura can trinket get in or do i need to bamf him in the necklace and bamf him out okay thats  what i do  matt you guys all do get inside the tunnel the boulder does appear to be stationary  laura should we leave it open or should we take the rods we might need to get /none/ out in a hurry  taliesin what a wonderfully convenient way to close and it also means that the dragon will not  be able to open the door  marisha because its wedged  taliesin its wedged shut  marisha she could turn into a person she can also teleport lets not forget that okay lets  keep going  matt all right  taliesin just lets remember to pick those up if theres anybody left to get them  matt you guys now stand in the 15footwide about 12foottall tunnel entrance to this  mountainside as you saw /none/ before the floor itself has a layer of dust theres a heavy smell of  ancient rot and stagnant water and wet earth the rock walls of the pathway are rough but appear to  have been intentionally carved for a purpose more than any sort of presentational element of it  theres no wind theres no movement of air everything in here has been at least in this  portion of it still and untouched for quite some time as you guys push forward through this  tunnel to where it begins to make its slow descent  laura /none/ stealth  matt you guys all right  liam checking checking checking 24  laura oh this is investigation  taliesin i thought you were stealthing  laura oh was that a stealth roll or an investigation roll  that was investigation right  matt that was investigation 24  laura dogshit 11  matt okay well have to make well say make new stealth checks since you guys have come out of  stealth and youre back in but as you guys are moving down the curvature of the tunnel vax you  notice that there are amongst the /none/ dust and pebbles of the floor small pieces and chunks of  other material most of them very small maybe anywhere from a pebble size to the size of this  die or a little larger and theyre different than the rock theyre a lighter material and almost  porous upon close look as you take one and look at it  liam scanlan and keyleth come up here please do you know what that is  marisha what is it  matt youve seen this before actually in a subterranean place once before although it was a  large /none/ field of it at the time there are a number of scattered shards of bone just kind of  scattered and cracked and broken across the floor not a very thick mat but just here and there  peppered throughout the walkway  marisha these are dead things this is bone yeah  matt you also do notice upon looking at a few of them on the ground now having the context a lot  of them look blackened a lot of them look like theyve been charred burnt  laura hey keyleth  marisha yeah  laura when you /none/ did the scrying thing how long did it take to get down in the tunnels was it a  lot of tunnels before you got to the laboratory  marisha in terms of my vision  laura yeah  matt you dont know it looked like youre at this point and then youre there  so you have no idea  laura its less than a mile down i know  marisha it kind of rushes past you really fast its a little disorienting  laura okay  liam no traps  matt no traps at the moment no  /none/ laura should we all stealth  patrick these are just here so that people step on them and it makes noise  liam its a theory we already stealthed  laura i thought we had to reroll stealth  liam oh i did  marisha can i do a this is some csi shit  matt you guys are going stealth right all right so roll your stealth checks please  travis plus ten  laura 30  liam 35  taliesin 34 and then scanlan  marisha 30 total  travis 28  laura 25 for pike  travis /none/ no sorry oh 30  taliesin 18 for scanlan  patrick 29 for me  matt great awesome all right so as you guys continue progressing down this curving tunnel it  goes into a very very mild descent  marisha can i do i wanna do a quick check this is some bonestype shit can i see if these bones  were charred recently or once again if these bones have been there for a long time i know this  is some weird carbondating shit  matt make a nature check on this actually this is your understanding /none/ at least of how fire against  bone which is  marisha ooh thats good 28  matt 28 yeah so understanding especially in the pyrah and noticing the difference and just your  experience of natural animals and creatures that have been cooked to be eaten and the effect of  the fire on the bones that are left behind this bone charring is not as ancient as say the trees  that have withered but theyre arent theyre years old at the very least if not longer  marisha years old if not longer  matt yeah theres /none/ a layer of dust on these bones as well that shows that at least they have  been untouched for a short time  marisha okay but wait was thordak here over a year ago  taliesin could have been yeah  laura he was here for a long time before he was here before he got the thing right  matt yeah he made this his lair after avoiding death from jmon sa ord in ankharel and then  recuperated here from what you know and then made this his domain for a while and then pressed  northward /dung/ in taldorei which is where  marisha thats when allura and her team encountered him  matt correct thats when thordak battled raishan and began the beginning of the formulation of the  conclave thats when thordak destroyed byroden and by proxy their mother thats when all of  that went down  liam while were quiet here in the dark i pull pike over to the side pike  laura yes  liam i have a bad will you take care of my sister you have that one thing that you do i  dont know what its called /none/ but if she falls down she gets back up again do you know what im  talking about  laura is that the death ward its a thing i talk to sarenrae and then she protects them for a  little bit of time  liam could you do that to my sister now  laura feels a little selfish but sure  laughter  liam i thought of it  laura i mean if you want me to do it  liam i do i do  laura sure why not i walk up to me i guess pike /none/ will cast death ward on vex  matt okay so thats a 4thlevel spell off pike and for the next eight hours  vex is death warded  liam when youre brought down to zero you ping up to one is the math on that  marisha its kind of like buying starbucks with the company amex  laura feels a little weird not gonna lie  liam its just strategy man game strategy well its done and my sister is a little safer  than she was before and yall can go fuck yourselves  marisha so easy when /none/ you have the pin code  laughter  liam this one and this one on me  laura yeah its totally cool  liam out of character matt pooped out this new feature to dying and shes on her last fucking  string man no regrets move forward  matt to be fair im still toying with it because its one of the things that im adjusting  as we go  liam well you said it and the spell is cast  matt thats not true at all  marisha you freaked everyone out matt  matt oh i /none/ can keep it if you want  marisha no dont worry about it  taliesin youre literally wearing a creeper shirt you have to be careful what you say god  every time  matt its a rule that im working with i may have jumped the gun in releasing it at the time as  im working on the campaign guide but one of the resurrection rules i was deciding the dc i think  five per death is a bit intense so i might adjust it more to be a two just cause i was thinking  in /dung/ a longterm campaign your character might die a lot more between levels one and 20 and then it  gets a little insane so im working on it  liam listen i help my sister okay  matt mind you shes still closer to death but yes  marisha mind you shes still closer to death  patrick just to ask a little bit as were going down here i dont know how everyone else is  geared up but im kind of vanilla human here and not that equipped to see in the dark  matt yeah in fact /none/ currently percival and kerrek are blind like pitchblack blind  laura wait light your little dagger up  matt all right  patrick actually you probably just hear kerrek say i am sorry but at this point  i cant see at all  liam im always holding two and one of them is i pull out the flametongue dagger and i wave a  fly away  laura this gnat this fucking gnat  liam and i hold it so that kerrek can see and i say we might die so try it one more time with  me /none/ irish wristwatch just once more before we die  patrick i dreamed about this last night  laughter  taliesin its a tough one  patrick irish wr laughs  cheering  patrick irish wristwatch  cheering  matt there you go well done  liam i feel so much closer to you now lets fucking do this  matt the dagger which emits flame on it is the equivalent of a candle he can see about 15 feet  beyond you and thats it  patrick well actually ill say as soon as i say are we okay with /dung/ light or are we trying to  keep it as dark as possible because  liam too late now  laura a little bit of light  liam theres a candle  matt there is now a flame licking the edge of the blade thats being held aloft so light is being  shed now in the tunnel though not a lot  travis you know you could put that out and they could just grab onto each one of our arms  and move forward  marisha yeah i go and find percy  taliesin okay  marisha and /none/ i link arms  travis oh jeez hey kerr you wanna cuddle  patrick actually yes  laughter  travis hey vax put that light out  matt all right so kerrek theres a moment of quiet and stillness in the darkness as you feel  the ground beneath you shift eversoslightly heavy footfalls approaching you as suddenly a  large muscled somewhat sweaty arm just curls around the outside of your shoulders and pulls you  close to grogs torso  patrick it is one of the most comforting things i have ever experienced  laughter  travis i /none/ love it i love it  liam were about to die  laura no no no  marisha okay i kinda guide percy as we go through  matt so you guys are making your way down this slow grade beneath yes  marisha being stealthy as fuck  matt you make incremental checks as we go eventually as the grade continues downward you  begin to see the hallway open up eversoslightly and what was once just somewhat rough rock walls begin  having slight shapes or details to them its still hard to see darkvision is you still /none/ need  a little light to make out fine details or things at a distance but it does help you at least make  out the basic shapes and things ahead of you you see what appear to be small shelves or alcoves  that are now beginning to show up every 20 or so feet as you progress down little bits of rock  that jut out that look like they were either bolted in or crafted on top of it and you see  small little cubbies almost little alcoves that are put into the rock as well /none/  laura hold your little dagger up to it i want to see what it is  liam youre sure  laura yeah  matt okay make a perception check  liam thats pretty good that is 29  matt okay you glance in the first one to your immediate right which is a small shelf outward  and you see what appear to be a number of dustcovered a cluster of candles that have long  burned and melted into dripping wax that pours down the side of this alcove thats it on that  particular shelf  laura /dung/ careful maybe keep it out just keep an eye out its hard to see down here  liam i can look at these after  laura no i just i mean for traps psh  matt okay so youre searching for traps now  liam constantly  matt go ahead and make another investigation check with disadvantage  laura cause its dark see if youd pulled your dagger out it wouldnt be so bad  liam good suggestion still at disadvantage  laura if his daggers out  matt let me doublecheck here its kind of a frustratingly broken ability /none/ in some cases if it  just is universally in here  laura im gonna pull out the flying carpet laughs and im gonna walk over to  matt so you can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light and in darkness  as if it were dim light so you have about 15 feet you can kind of see out in front of you in  straight darkness if you have your dagger out you can see pretty decently for 60 feet  is how it works  liam but if /none/ its gone i can see 15 feet ahead  matt kinda shitty in 15 feet  laura im gonna give the  liam so regular checks if the daggers out  matt for at least 60 feet for you  liam and this is investigation 18  matt okay nothing seems to catch your attention as you continue pushing forward you see one more  of these shelves are you looking at each one as you go  liam yeah right now i am  matt okay as you glance past another perception check  laura hey grog so i /none/ have this flying carpet  liam 22  matt 22 okay you can see on the left shelf appears to be a humanoid skull thats up on top  next to two more candles one of them more melted than the other but the wax drips past theres a  shelf across the way on the opposite side that appears to have a couple of small books that are  put off to the side and what looks like a small wooden box  liam is the box trapped  matt roll an investigation check  liam that is a /none/ 22  matt box does not appear trapped from what you can tell  liam nah fuck it  taliesin put it in the bag of holding  liam i dont  matt okay continue walking  liam mmhm looking for traps  matt okay as you continue keeping an eye out in front of you the next shelf you come across looks  to have some sort of a mummified racoontype creature that is propped up  laughter  matt not taxidermied by any means it just looks like it dried out in a sort of standing position  /none/ or at least is leaning against the wall of the platform  marisha oh like some weird pompeii shit like he died that way  matt kind of literally just shriveled  laura grog would you be able to use a flying carpet in battle to get up to a dragon  travis i have no idea  laura it could be useful  matt kerrek do you have something you wanted to say  patrick yeah im just gonna blind as a bat as i am im gonna use divine sense to see if i can  sense any /none/ undead corrupt fiend its kind of a long list but i do know corrupt  was mentioned in there  taliesin also vax what were the titles of those books earpiece listening to your vague  description of things  liam thank you for retconning that yeah well ask him yeah but i wouldve read them if i  couldve im not grog  taliesin grog wouldve read them even if he just made up words  matt you do sense that there is some sort of an undead presence in your vicinity kerr though you  do not quite /none/ know what its nature is or its direction there is something undead near you  marisha oh jeez she didnt bring thordak back did she were gonna have to  fight an undead dragon  patrick do i get a sense of is it just yes it is present i dont get any sense of direction or  intensity im assuming this isnt my first rodeo everybody bumps into skeletons  early in their career  matt correct i would say it does not appear to be any extreme yeah it does not appear to be an  extremely powerful /none/ undead presence you cant tell size or direction by any means but its not like  all of a sudden theres a lich ahead of you or some massive arrival of orcus you just sense  something around you that is an undead energy  laura around us like how close around us can he sense that  liam i mean this could be crypt shit on the sides im gonna focus a  little more on the ground  matt okay do you guys all continue moving forward  taliesin i did ask about the books the titles of /none/ the books  liam yes he asked me through the earpiece what the books said  could i read them when i saw them  matt what languages do you know  liam common elvish and abyssal  matt you do not know the title of the books  liam tighter buns in 30 days is the only title i saw looking for traps  matt all right roll another investigation check  liam 25  matt 25 okay you continue to push forward there is no trap set you do look ahead and see  what appears to be /none/ the pathway is now showing stonework at times almost like there are slabs  elements of a tunnel that was once better constructed than what exists but is either eroded  away or elements of wall collapse have covered what was once a  very very ancient form of architecture  liam as a precaution im going to as much as i can stay to the stuff that looks natural or  fuckedup and not civilized  patrick hold on first im sorry i just found my specific description it does say i sense type  and location  matt /none/ it does say that i totally missed that  patrick so long as its not behind total cover  matt got you okay then you sense there is something you know its from one of the wall  areas but you cannot see and your one single bit of light source is ahead of you in the tunnel but  you do sense at one point as youre walking it is to the left of you  patrick okay i say there is an unclean thing here  travis well fuck im sorry its just not a priority for me /none/ all right  laughter  travis i mean i put my arm down off his shoulder ill grant him at least that  patrick its not you grog theres some undead thing here and i say its off to the left  to my left  taliesin the left hand of the tunnel  patrick but i dont know whats around here  laura can we see anything on the walls that looks like a door or anything  matt are you stopping cause you two are moving ahead of everyone else so you guys are probably a  good /none/ 15 20 feet ahead you want to move back with them  laura no no  travis can i look to the left just off him saying that because of the belt of dwarvenkind i  have darkvision  matt you do you glance off to the left you can see upon that shelf unit there there are the two  candles and the singular skull set on the shelf  travis i start to slowly make my way over to the skull  matt okay  liam gods damn it  matt kerrek you feel grog slowly step in /none/ the direction that you pointed out to him  travis is this the direction  patrick yes  travis are we getting warmer  patrick yes its over there im not bringing my hammer out but my hammers ready  travis what does the skull look like  matt it looks like a human skull  travis anything shiny about it or jewelled  matt no it looks kind of dustcovered you can see what looks to be the bone itself appears to  have a hint of blackened soot or some sort of a darker color to it  /none/ like its been slightly singed  travis candles look like candles  matt candles look like mostly melted candles  travis kerr i hate to rain on your parade but i only see two candles and a human skull up here  patrick partial undead thing do i know again obviously nothing is trying to eat our faces off  here but can you turn an undead thing into just like a watcher or a trap or a spy or a trigger  matt make an intelligence check or make a religion check make a religion check  laura oh /none/ it could be watching through the skull youre brilliant kerr fuck  patrick you know thats about a 12  matt okay  patrick not my best  matt best that you can understand is undead magic can raise dead it can control dead you  have heard stories of undead or the use of them being more situational as opposed to just roaming  as zombies but thats as much as you can call off the top of your head its been a while since  youve been adventuring so the specific stories are a little too foggy  /none/ taliesin yeah it could be a security camera  patrick actually i say if theres give me the skull and im just  reaching out blindly in his direction  travis all right i grab the skull and hand it to kerr  matt okay  patrick and then ill use divine sense again is it this  matt it is the skull is the source of the undead energy it is not currently moving or reacting or  having any sort of reaction to being held by you  patrick i say anybody mind if i wreck this thing /none/  travis no i do not mind at all thank god theres someone else in this world  with my sort of thinking  liam what are you doing back there  travis hold on i grab my earring and i say kerr found a human skull that has some undead  vibes vibrating out of it  laura okay  travis but its not doing anything do you mind if we destroy it  liam hes already holding it  travis yeah  liam well i mean if anything was gonna happen were probably fucked already so i dont /none/ know  taliesin actually wheres kima  matt thats a good point what is your guys marching order by the way i know the twins are  in the front  taliesin then i think its you and kerr and then me and  matt grog and kerr keyleth and percy  taliesin ash and scanlan  matt ash and scanlan after that and then we have do you have trinket out of the necklace  right then probably kima and allura back with trinket in the back so theyre kind of holding up  the rear and keeping an /none/ eye out behind as they go  taliesin i think destroying it will trigger it  liam im kind of for leaving things alone as we go through here percival  travis i mean we can leave it alone  laura i could do sacred flame on it and it would do radiant damage to it  marisha what if we turn and just face the skull so its looking into the corner  laura sure  marisha so its not looking at us  liam i think dicking with it in the first place might have already ruined us /none/ but yeah lets just  set it down turn it around  travis hey kerr theyre worried were gonna kill ourselves can you just put it back but face  it towards the wall like its in time out  patrick sure if ive got a spare sack ill stuff it in the sack and  point it towards the wall  matt okay so you pull out the extra kind of a heavy burlap sack you throw the skull in there  tie it taut and set it back up on the shelf facing away from where youre standing /none/  taliesin do not underestimate the power of burlap  laura we shouldve come down in the tunnel wearing pantyhose on our heads so raishan wouldnt  have known  taliesin just thought it was a college prank  marisha oh man we should totally invest in those little pantyhose eggs  liam delta lambda again sneaking in aw  matt every time  liam i dont know enough about that to say that correctly either  matt continuing onward into the next length of the tunnel about another 50 feet or so there  is the room opens up /none/ and you can see that stonework eventually takes the entire floor and  the chamber opens up into what looks to be almost like a hexagonalshaped chamber that ends at a  large iron door it fills the entirety of the chamber and it seals off any progression from  that point make a perception check  travis vexagonal shaped  laura vexagonal should i make a perception check too since im near it  matt sure  liam 22  laura oh god that was almost a one but its not it was a 15  matt okay so /dung/ 15 total okay as you glance you can see at the center of this chamber there looks  to be lets see here okay yeah there stands a pillar of dark green marble about ten feet 15  feet away from where the iron door is and what looks to be a roughly forged bowl of iron that is  imperfect and is bolted to the top of this pillar  liam on the top or out the side of the top  matt resting on top of it and its about maybe five six feet up and there is /none/ a platform that  leads up to it so maybe if you were standing on the little dais around it itd be about  chestheight to you  liam how tall is this chamber  matt the chambers whole height would be about 25 feet you also see off to the right what appears  to be another shelf that contains a very very large leatherbound tome and what looks to be a  cold iron brazier that is unburnt but has a bunch of dried tinder in it  laura oh god  liam oh come here come here /none/  laura what  liam theres some shit theres some ingredients in that ready to go  laura theres ingredients  liam yeah theres something in that brazier over there that she hasnt burned yet  taliesin can i get a little light in here just for a second  liam im holding  matt you have a tiny bit of candlelight you can see about ten 15 feet around vax  taliesin okay so i cant see the mechanism on the door  matt you do not even know theres a door there  taliesin okay thats fair for /none/ the best it would just scare me  laura i mean would it be helpful if everyone could see  taliesin take a look around  marisha no one else is in this room yeah can the halfelves with darkvision do a little  matt make perception checks  liam ill do that and im also going to do divine sense here  marisha dont fuck me gil oh thanks gil thats not bad perception right 26  travis 16  liam 22  matt there does not appear to be anybody else in this chamber with you and from /none/ your divine sense  you do not sense any undead within 60 feet of you right now  liam theres no undead dragons walking around  travis can i look for invisible dragons no im kidding  taliesin you see seven  laura so light should we light it up  matt he doesnt sense any undead within 60 feet thats the range of it  liam right how far from the gate to the far side of the room is the first question  matt the doorway you mean  liam im at a gate that blocks us from /none/ going in is that correct  matt no youre entering this chamber then on the opposite side of the room there is a larger  door that prevents you from progressing beyond the doorway in between you and that door there is  that raised platform the pillar and the iron bowl and then to the right and against the wall  there is the brazier and the shelf with the singular tome  laura does it look like when we entered the chamber does it look like a door would come down  or something when it opened up /none/ into the chamber  liam right is there a gap like a crack that something could slide down out of right above  where we are  matt glancing up based on your perception rolls you dont see anything that would dictate any sort  of exit or entranceway from the ceiling  liam and in addition to everything we see do we see levers do we see panels do we see anything  on the walls in this room  matt no theres standard stone old stone masonry you can see chunks that have broken off  and just /none/ fallen over the years theres a couple small cavein areas where it looks like rocks have  just tumbled in as the general shifting of the island has caused some elements to fall loose and  tumble in  marisha keyleth is gonna go ahead and light up her fire hands  matt okay that gives a bigger radius comparable torchlight to keyleth and now kerrek and  percival you guys can both have a much better view of the room you can see now this iron bowl  on top of this pillar in the center you can just /none/ make out the large iron wall or door on the  opposite side and a little bit of the brazier and the tome  taliesin ive built a firelock mechanism for a door before would i recognize this as being a set  a fire in the bowl and that might open the door  matt make an intelligence check  taliesin i built one for the raven queen temple  marisha go percy go percy go  taliesin intelligence check thats with my new intelligence level thats a 19  matt 19 best you can glance here i mean /none/ its possible but this  taliesin its magic  matt you dont know the room itself is ancient and the construction there is nothing that  appears to be mechanically attached  taliesin so if it did it would be magical if that was  matt yeah theres no chain pulley system visible at all where the door hits the seam of  the room it looks very smooth  laura can i go look in the bowl the bowl in the middle of the room and just look and see if  theres a residue of anything in it /none/  matt sure you can make an investigation check  patrick can i just say that when the lights came up kerr kind of hed been leaning into grog  maybe more than was entirely appropriate so he kind of stood up a little better on his own to get  out of it  matt right clears throat  liam luckily no one saw you because of that robe  laura 26  matt as you look down into the bowl you can make out what looks to be a very very faint longdried  residue just at the /dung/ very very bottom of it some sort of a liquid that was once in there that has  since dried up entirely and left this very very faint just a slight shift in texture other than  the hammered iron  laura no color change or anything on it  matt not that you can really tell no youre just looking into this dark bowl with a little bit  of light source  laura well i dont actually touch it  taliesin do you have something sharp to just scrape some off  liam while shes doing that im /none/ just going to quietly extend my wings now  matt your wings  laura oh yeah i get out a lockpick and scrape it to see if i can  patrick holy shit  laughter  liam theyre pretty cool arent they  laura they take up a lot of room though so  liam no they dont they go out and they slam back into my back  matt yeah kerrek as theyre having this conversation youre looking watching as this  small halfelf rogue that youve had a few encounters with suddenly just sends this pair of  /none/ large jetblack ravenlike wings that fire from his shoulderblades and slowly fold behind him  taliesin they dont work he just does that to be an asshole  marisha its all a cosplay prop thats all it is  patrick strikes a bit of a figure though doesnt he  taliesin no its very attractive  liam i heard percival say that  laura scratchscratch scrapescrape  matt youre scraping the  laura yeah just to see what the residue is  matt okay it scrapes up it creates a small almost like a dried powdertype substance  laura what /dung/ color is it  matt its like a dark burgundy  laura this is fucking blood  taliesin can i taste it  matt yeah taste it has kind of an ironlike taste  marisha oh its so blood oh youre so right  laura maybe we should just bleed into this bowl and the door will open  taliesin tempting  travis i can do that  laura necromancy  marisha i think thats the word yeah  taliesin do we recognize the architecture of the door and i also want to take a look at that book  /none/ what is the books language what does it look like im not picking it up yet im just looking  at it on the shelf  matt the leather tome which is currently leaning up against it has no text on the cover and no text  on the spine but it is big its about that big so its like a tome  travis is it made of skin  matt grog do you want to go over and check it out  travis yes  matt okay it appears to be a thick leather its hard to tell /none/ in this light if it was made from  tanned hide or tanned flesh but it is old  liam as were watching grog i just lean over and say you know you are criticizing the size of my  wings you are walking around with a persian rug a broom and a longbow strapped to your back  laura i tried to give this rug to someone else but grog didnt want to take it  marisha and then i come up and i say can i pet your wings ive never pet them before  laura theres things /none/ going on in this room  matt you can hear this heavy sigh from allura behind you shes like sighs im just this  is my first time actually adventuring with you  marisha this is our method  taliesin were going to see if we put the pda in the bowl see if thatll  matt oh dont get me wrong it just reminds me of my early days as an adventurer and i forgot  just how ridiculous we were so  travis is there still tinder under the  matt yeah theres the iron brazier and theres /dung/ a lot of dried inside there yeah  taliesin well we do have samples of blood in theory in the bag of holding  laura weve got dragon blood im gonna get out a vial of dragon blood  feedback sound  liam oh jeez  taliesin youve caused a feedback loop  liam shes coming  marisha we are spinal tap  laura what is it  matt i dont know  laura i put the dragon blood away  liam are there any holes in the ceiling i can see like there were in the last cave  /none/ marisha i have this ringing in my ear  matt there do not appear to be holes in the ceiling no  laura what should i do wait ive also got other kinds of blood let me see what kinds of blood  ive got  taliesin is the book trapped  liam 24  matt 24 looking at the book are you taking it off the shelf or are you  liam no im looking at it man  matt looking at it it looks like it is just resting against the wall the shelf unit is not  /none/ trapped the book itself does not appear to have any sort of connection to the wall you can see  the pages themselves are weathered old stained but intact  liam is anyone near me  matt currently percivals a step or two behind you  taliesin im holding onto the wing  liam i push back slowly with my wings just get 15 20 behind me im gonna bring it to you im  gonna try to take this fucking book off okay if im going to go down i dont want you to go down  as well /none/ all right  travis are you about to die right now  marisha dont ve vax  laughter  marisha i love you i know your name on my good days  travis chanting grab it grab it grab it  liam i get back about ten feet and i take my wing and i scootch it  laura oh wait you know what  matt as youre saying this the book impact and hits the ground it scatters open  liam oh its open percival come here and i light it up just to look  at the pages /none/ that are there  matt so you take the dagger and you place it over there you dont recognize the text and you try  and focus on it too and you dont recognize it either its like the more you look at the text  the text gets smaller and smaller and smaller until its microscopic it just looks like a mess  of symbols and details its weird its almost like as you get closer the perspective keeps  shifting away from you to where you cannot actually make out or read the text in the book  /none/ travis hows it feel  taliesin im gonna flip gently with a gloved hand flip through a couple pages just to see if  its text text text or if theres any  matt as of right now it looks like theres just text as you go through every page seems to have  the same sort of reaction where as your eyes try and focus in the low light the text just gets  smaller and smaller and just avoid comprehension  taliesin im going to flip to the front really quickly and see if theres a title  /none/ matt there is a title and as you look at it the title itself seems to be blurred and obscured and  begins to shrink as well its like trying to put on a pair of reading glasses that wont focus  taliesin i know that feeling  liam allura will you have a look at this  matt she comes over kerr what are you doing  patrick ill actually bring out my hammer and assuming that i can get close to the book as well  it does the same thing for me  matt as you get /tavern/ close and look yes the same thing your vision doesnt seem to focus on the  text the pages seem to just hide from  patrick i was going to say are we okay with more light  travis yeah  patrick kind of looking around okay then ill effectively ill activate the hammer  matt okay as he pulls his warhammer in front of him you watch as the head of it  the spike in the back  patrick there is no head its just kind of a bar of iron that he has until he holds it /none/ up and then  the head of it comes into being as an artifact of radiant light  marisha oh thats cool  matt so what wouldve been the back of the hammer the front of it is like you said missing  entirely and it just blazes forth with radiant energy like a giant glowing metallic  end of a weapon  patrick id also like to think that it makes a noise like a lightsaber but thats just  matt lightsaber sound as it happens the room is now much brighter and you can see the details  /none/ of the stonework around you the mustiness seems to almost back away instinctually from the radiant  light itself almost warms the air in its vicinity  marisha it smells like strawberries  taliesin thats me  matt its very weird strawberries probably as the light hits the pages the pages go almost  blank the text just shrinks away to the point where it looks like theres just tiny tiny dots  taliesin i think ive solved this  laura what  taliesin lets extinguish all the lights and someone with lowlight vision has to read it  laura /none/ okay grog  travis yeah  taliesin no thats not funny  laura i mean sure yeah extinguish all the lights i wanna go and see if i can read it  patrick switch off the hammer  matt okay the head of the warhammer flickers out leaving just the handle behind you go ahead  and look at it and the text is more legible there on the page  but its still blurred to your vision  laura i think i need glasses its blurry  taliesin do we have anybody with perfect nightvision  marisha perfect nightvision /none/  patrick 2020 nightvision  taliesin well i cant see a thing  marisha nothing for you  laura nah its blurry  marisha still blurry i look over vexs shoulder maybe i dont know anything i know primordial  liam might be that were too nice  travis maybe if you put something in the pot and set it on fire by that light youll  marisha scanlan goes up and looks at it  taliesin begrudgingly  matt scanlan glances over its fine to me i dont know what your problem was  no i have no idea /none/ whats on the pages  im just messing with you  groaning  matt sorry guys  marisha i thought we figured something out  laura thats actually a really good idea grog maybe we should light the brazier  taliesin we should light the brazier that or raid the cabinets we passed  matt allura whos oh so youre going to light the brazier with your hand  marisha oh i dont know i was lighting my hand i can do it  taliesin were bringing the light back  matt okay so the room fills with light once /none/ more kerrek you can bring your hammer back if  youd like  liam were basically all running around the room in circles  matt yeah you guys are just charging around  marisha are we gonna light this brazier keyleth goes up and just sticks her flaming hand right  down into the middle of the brazier  matt okay your hand hits the top of the kindling at which point the wood catches and  theres a slight flash as the extremely explosive materials that were within the brazier detonate  causing percival allura vex and vax who /none/ were also reading the book nearby to all have to make  a dexterity saving throw as theres a sudden explosion it explodes with a force  marisha do i make a dexterity save as well  matt you dont make it you just take the damage since you were at ground zero  marisha yeah thats fair  patrick to be fair i was right next to the book as well  matt thats right so you go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw as well kerrek  taliesin thatll do  laura 22  taliesin 24  /none/ liam 16 and a luck blown  matt kerrek whatd you get  patrick i got a three  laura oh no kerr  matt oh allura made it okay everyone but kerrek made the saving throw so kerrek and  keyleth you both take 32 points of fire damage the rest of you take 16 you take none because  youre a rogue  liam yeah i start breakdancing doing the worm underneath the blast jeez all right the luck wasnt  blown because the other roll was a one  marisha grog did you see that  travis /none/ i did but everythings really really bright right now  matt your ears are ringing from the blast of the impact the braziers just all the metals just  bent outward and ruined  travis ive just got the litup shapes of a bunch of people going like that  matt as keyleth turns around you can see just her hairs blown back a bit  shes like a cartoon character  taliesin this has happened to me dozens of times  marisha that was awesome  laura if raishan didnt hear us before she potentially heard us now  /none/ taliesin at least now we dont have to try and stealth anymore  marisha shouting is the door open im sorry if im speaking loudly  laughter  matt the door is not open  marisha shouting the door is not open  laura we need blood  taliesin the books fine i assume  matt the book has burned entirely it is destroyed  taliesin thats awesome  travis who cares about books  matt and you see allura who made the save but took some damage is at the back and is kind of  chuckling to herself /none/ goes well i think now we know the purpose of the book  marisha what  laura oh that dick book  travis no fucking way  matt it was wellplayed and curse be on the one who thought that up  laura laughs i know who that is  laughter  taliesin do i recognize the smell of whatever they used to ignite that or was it more mystical  in nature  matt it was a sort of mixture of extremely flammable liquids it was not black powder  taliesin okay i was just curious all right well /none/ lets try and pour some of the dragon blood  into the bowl and see if that does it  travis does what  laura opens the door  travis oh  taliesin lets blow a vial see what happens  laura dragon blood is so expensive  travis cant we just knock it down  laura i have basilisk blood black dragon blood and white dragon blood  taliesin lets try basilisk and work our way up  travis theyre worth 7000 gold each  laura i know thats why the basilisk is better one basilisk vial  matt /none/ okay so as you uncork and let it flow and its thick syrupy it hits and it pools a moment  passes two moments nothing  laura fuck i pull out my opal dagger and i just cut my hand and drip it in  matt okay the basilisk blood thats still in there you bleed into the basilisk blood and it  pools in the center of it and you watch as the blood that you just dropped gets pulled beneath  the surface of the basilisk blood and out of sight  laura creepy is the door opening /none/  matt from the few drops of blood you put in there it has not opened  laura its like a killsomething sort of situation  patrick kerrek is reaching out kind of like dontdontdont theres a lot of things in the  world that shouldnt have your blood  laura oh well shit laughs  patrick especially something clever enough to lay a trap like that might be clever enough to trick  a bunch of people into handing over blood  travis how far is it to the door  matt from the pillar about 15 feet  /none/ travis i walk over to the door  matt okay  liam im gonna go with grog yeah  laura punch it  travis can i would you mind  taliesin you guys work on your thing im gonna work on another thing im gonna go over to those  other shelves im gonna see what the fuck is up there  marisha i go with percy i do that inspecting the shelves  taliesin im gonna quickjog to the other shelves and take a look at those books  matt the door begins to shift theres a slight shaking /none/ sensation as the bowl itself begins to  glow and the basilisks blood begins to sizzle and burn away almost like its being pushed to the  outer edges of the bowl with just the singular drops from your blood resting in the center the  room begins to shake a bit and you watch as dust that had been alongside the ceiling begins to  slightly cascade from above you the metallic door lifts up and reveals the other side  marisha completely its open  matt its open you do take a point of damage from the blood /none/ that you lost  laura okay  matt so you guys are just starting to push out of the room at which point  you begin to hear laughter  taliesin oh fuck  matt cackling multiplesources laughter cackling and you watch as down in the distance  of each side of the hallway from where you came and where youre going these little sources of  light suddenly spark up and begin drifting towards you  laura pike immediately casts  liam beacon of hope  laura no no no not that she casts the other thing shouldnt she /none/ its undead holy aura on  all of us  matt okay what does that do  laura i wrote it all down hold on hold on it is within a 30foot radius where everybody is it  sheds a fivefoot radius of light on everyone everybody gets advantage on saving throws enemies  who are attacking have disadvantage on everyone fiends and undead who do melee attacks have to  make a constitution save or be blinded  matt okay all right so yeah thats on yourself and it creates a 30foot radius around  you as you guys /none/ all see these sources of light hovering towards you the cackling getting louder  and louder from a source just out of view pike grabs her holy symbol and slams her hand down onto  the stonework in the center by where the pillar is as it hits theres a explosion sound as the  vibrations or impact shift through the ground and you feel the ground itself grow warm with radiant  energy as a giant circle of ancient radiant runes begin to connect and intersect and within that  circle you all kind of rush in and as /none/ you do you feel the warmth of that protection come over you  as you all gather with your weapons at the ready you see now the sources of light as roughly four  floating flamewreathed skulls come rocketing in two from each side of the hallway cackling along  the way and were gonna take a break  yelling  travis flaming skulls  matt flaming skulls  marisha flamewreathed skulls  matt just floating towards you you get the sense that one of these may have at one point been  contained within a bag  liam guys /none/ its fine my tenyearold son destroyed one of these recently  were gonna be fine  taliesin firecracker outside  matt all right so well be back here in a few minutes were going to go ahead and take a  restroom break and well see where this next chapter is  laura oh my god  break  matt welcome back everyone to critical role were back from break the party just found  themselves immediately surrounded by large floating flaming skulls in the center of this  hallway going towards the necromancers sanctum i need you all to /none/ roll initiative please  liam sings get it on  marisha laughing its the kiss army  matt while theyre rolling their initiatives we had a winner in the chatroom for a wyrmwood  zebrawood complete dice tower system right here as well as this awesome leather thing from  wyrmwood here they have this nice leather band as well the winner is heartman by the way  congratulations heartman  marisha i think you have zebrawood  taliesin zebrawood

scanlan at the top all right 20 to 15  laura 16 for vex  taliesin 17  matt percy vex 15 to ten  travis me 14  matt all righty  patrick just out of curiosity do you allow people to delay their action to  act later in the turn  matt you can hold an action meaning you still take your turn you still move but you can hold  your action for a trigger so like i will hold my action to attack if something comes in range or i  can hold my action /none/ to cast a spell when a certain creature does something but you still take your  turn you dont move the turn order  travis whatd pike roll  laura pike rolled a nine  matt pike at the end kerrek whatd you get  patrick a one  matt oh kerr  liam number one  marisha pike  laura nine  marisha who rolled one  laura kerr  matt its okay you and kima are down there all right so  patrick the term is anchorman  laura i like it  matt all righty so at /none/ the top of the round as these skulls are beginning to find their way in  towards the cavern towards you as youve all circled around pike in the center of this chamber  here i would like scanlan and vax to go first  liam all right after you scanman  taliesin i can turn myself invisible its a level three spell  matt you can  taliesin im gonna turn invisible and back up against the northern wall in the corner and see if  the skulls notice  matt okay so scanlan is gonna go invisible and /none/ back up here  marisha its a 2ndlevel spell  matt all righty 2nd level  taliesin and im going to hold my action until i find out whether or not  oh invisible is my action  matt casting the spell is your action  taliesin all right im gonna back up and yeah  matt okay so you back up against the wall there okay so thats your turn vax  liam can you point to where i am in that scrum i cant tell im

here  liam and im gonna huck a pair of daggers at i hope this is the right way the one on this side  thats closest to you  matt right here okay go for it  liam thats shit and then the second one  laura well dont write it off it was 15 that first one  liam thats true its a 15 /none/ and then a 23  matt both hit  liam hey all right so first one is with whisper that is four plus eight is 12 plus  psychic damage which is 19 for the first hit and from the venom dagger that im throwing next that  is four plus six is ten ten total  matt so 19 points of damage total awesome that end your turn  liam thats the end of my turn  matt all right that brings us to keyleth  marisha oh dear god i knew you were gonna say that hang on /none/ hang on im looking up the  parameters of the spell let me see lmno  travis what happened when he hit em with those daggers  matt as both these daggers slam into the skull you watch as the flames themselves that are kind  of wreathing around them the skull just ducks out of the way but the blade still catches and  scrapes across the side of the bone and it has to right itself but then it gets right back into the  place it was its taking damage and you can see portions of the /none/ bone are starting to crack and  break but its still you know still holding itself aloft  laura did its little jawbone go chattering teeth  matt not yet its not its turn yet its an action to chatter ill get you heman no  liam you boob  matt sings oh my god do i pray anyway sorry oh internet never change  marisha sings for a revolution  matt so what are you doing for your action keyleth  marisha huh  taliesin shes inspiring  marisha i got inspired  matt no what are you doing /none/ on your turn  travis did you stick cotton in your ears during the break  marisha sorry i got distracted okay  matt next to allura and you have kerrek to your other side  marisha which direction were we heading  matt you were heading this direction the giant gate was here and it lifted up and then all the  skulls swarmed in from that side  marisha theres only two right now  matt theres four theres two on this side two on this side  marisha okay im going to cast moonbeam on hm let /none/ me do this one that guy that make sense  so its 120 foot its a concentration spell up to a minute and its a fivefoot radius  40foothigh cylinder it causes searing pain and takes 2d10 radiant damage after a constitution  saving throw  matt okay so constitution saving throw on each of these guys here  marisha its a fivefoot radius  matt okay so you can hit one oh if you hit there you can hit em both  marisha can i then i do that  matt all righty and they that is a 16 /none/  marisha fail  matt and a 13 so no they fail em both  cheering  marisha oh thats good above average six plus seven is 13 points of damage  matt 13 points of damage to both of them  marisha you know just a little bit of radiant damage  matt so as the beam bursts out from the sky you see the white radiant nature energy burst around  them and the flames seem to subside for a moment as the one thats already been damaged by vax  almost stumbles to the floor then picks /none/ itself back up its flame flickering more so than the  allies around you that end your turn keyleth you gonna stay where you are or you gonna move  marisha im on the are we all on the carpet  matt no no ones been on the carpet  marisha we never did that then i will back away towards me and towards the southeast corner  matt over here okay  marisha yeah southeast to you  matt more south  marisha no no thats right thats right thats good  matt that ends your turn all right /dung/ it is now the flame skulls turn so all four of these  skulls you watch as the flames swirl around the head pour into the skull itself and for a  second the flame almost goes dark as all of a sudden the eyes burst into angry fire the mouth  grows extremely bright and a single red beam streaks forth from the jaw to the center of the  room four of these beams in different directions here followed by four simultaneous familiar  explosions as four separate fireballs rock the room  liam four separate fireballs  /none/ travis fuck  laura were gonna die just from fucking  liam wow look at that everybody  matt yeah you guys clustered right there  laura well we didnt get a chance to move  marisha this is the room  matt well no you guys said you all were gonna back in around pike  and you havent had your turn yet  marisha its also still the room  matt i know i know this happens guys sorry  travis like where else were we gonna go its a huge explosion  matt not knowing or seeing /none/ where sam went they all focus here which will affect everybody so i  need everybody to make four dexterity saving throws now mind you  marisha everyone except scanlan or still scanlan  matt everyone except for scanlan  laura and everybodys got advantage on every single one of those rolls  marisha wait dex throws  matt all saving throws you have advantage on  taliesin four saving throws with advantage  liam you crazy motherfucker  travis god damn it thats the same number  matt youre trying to beat a 13  marisha how many do /none/ we oh we have to roll it each time  matt yeah for each one  marisha natural 20 on my second were trying to beat a 13  matt trying to beat a 13  marisha i cleared all of them  taliesin cleared all of them  liam cleared all of them evasion  laura wait i gotta do them for pike  marisha no rolls for scanlan okay  laura fuck sighs do i have to roll for trinket too oh god  matt everyone was there  laura okay pike saves two and fails two vex /none/ saves all  matt okay  laura god  travis these little disembodied bastards are tough  laura trinket only saves against one  travis what are these called  patrick even with advantage  laura even with advantage  taliesin its her magic power  laura trinket just constantly i didnt add anything oh well he had a plus two  matt grog  travis i failed the first two succeeded on the second two ten ten 21 21  matt okay so you take 76 points of fire damage percy  taliesin save save save save  matt /none/ okay so you take grog i said 78 right  travis you said 72  matt sorry 72 that is 48 points of fire damage to you percy  marisha you saved from all of em same 17 natural 20 14 18  taliesin 42 points of damage wait how much  matt sorry this is a lot of fireballs and a lot of rolls right now so for percival altogether  if you made all the saves it would be shit okay  taliesin some mild asbestos in the coat  marisha made of polyester  matt well say /none/ for the sake of this and the ease of the damage here you take 56 points of fire  damage percy  taliesin how much sorry  matt 56 points of fire damage  marisha if you saved against all of them 56  matt yes  travis should i have taken more  matt you technically wouldve taken no you took 70  travis i failed two  matt thats right you failed two so that would be  marisha thats with a nat 20  matt you take 88  laura oh my lord  marisha with a /none/ nat 20 you still take half damage  matt yeah so how many did you get keyleth  marisha i saved all of them so im at 50 hit points  matt okay kerrek how many did you save  patrick i did i made all of them thanks to the advantage  liam nice kerrek  matt so you take 56 points of fire damage  liam i saved all of them with evasion thats zero yeah  matt yeah so you take zero  liam yeah flat against the ground  matt you just duck out of the /none/ way vex  laura i saved against all of them  matt 56 points of fire damage  laura so im at 57 hit points now  matt okay pike failed two  laura she failed two of them yeah so 88  matt 88 but half that because she has fire resistance so 44  laura oh thank god okay thats good thats good and then trinket only got one so hes in my  necklace already  liam luckily luckily  matt you can bring him out and heal him in a minute if you want to that /none/ brings allura  through her barrier and extra hit points that brings her to okay there we go and kima also  failed two so she took all righty  patrick if im still hugging grog can i use him as partial cover  laughter  matt going forward you can yes from the curling flames of the arcane blasts  unfortunately not that much cover from that however they all then go ahead and scoot back  towards the wall the holy radius itself is starting to affect them so this one is starting  to back up in /none/ this direction and these two are going to go ahead and this ones going to curl  around the fallen stonework and land there that is going to end their turn  travis were in a fucking kill box  taliesin its a box of kill  matt now that brings us to percivals turn  taliesin im irritated so which was the one that you were shooting at  marisha theres one thats almost dead whats the one thats almost dead  liam yeah the one that matt just touched  taliesin im gonna start with him and im /none/ going to just to be a dick im going to pull some  deadeye and a sharpshooter on this one  liam get out of the box  taliesin so im going to start with him taking a shot with animus  laura animus  taliesin with the animus gun which is with the sharpshooter on is 26 to hit  matt yeah that hits so roll damage for that  taliesin thats sorry im a little out of it what do i need i need one of these oh ill use  this one its prettier just counting the /none/ dice thats nice thats 17 27 points of damage plus  two points of psychic damage  matt okay as you take your first shot the one skulls just trying to duck around the partially  crumbled wall you catch it right before it goes behind cover and as your bullet hits from the  side the skull just explodes and shatters into a burst of flame and broken bone expelled and  extinguished on the battlefield  marisha fucking dick  taliesin next shot laughs  marisha do you get a grit point you get a grit point back /none/  taliesin i killed it so grit point back actually and im going to spend another grit  point for the same shot so yes thats  travis these are not living creatures though right  matt they are not  taliesin im gonna just switch to the one yeah just gonna switch  so that were not flanked by the  travis flaming jungle mob  taliesin same sharpshooter same thing same attack 26  matt hits  taliesin thats not as good but its okay 22 points of damage  plus six points of psychic damage  matt /none/ okay all righty so this shot impacts and it sends it slamming into the wall and it rights  itself back in its position but you can see noticeable cracks across the bone cranium of it  and little bits of fire are poking through areas where its starting to come apart but its still  keeping itself together at the moment  taliesin im going to take another shot at it sharpshooter but not with the deadeye pewpew  not as good a shot 16  matt 16 still hits  taliesin thatll do  marisha kill it kill /dung/ it  taliesin thats 20 points of damage with four points of psychic damage  matt that does it another blast echoes through as the gunshot goes off you watch as the  secondary light source from that side of the hallway just is immediately extinguished that  hallway goes dark once more the two glowing lights untouched on the area  you came from still standing  taliesin i do a quick reload and i run up the wall to yeah that way but to an angle yeah  im gonna perch up there  marisha grit point back /none/  taliesin oh yeah i get the grit point back thank you  matt i like how keyleth is becoming your paper clip for this battle  marisha did you know  taliesin im trying to write  patrick sorry i meant to mention this before and this might not be relevant because everyone  has just made eight saving throws or rolled eight saving throw dice everyone close to me because  of my aura of divinity gets a plus three because of my charisma bonus  matt thats true  patrick i would not bring it up after /none/ the fact if that was not just such  an ungodly buttload of damage  travis doesnt affect my rolls  matt that would affect your rolls you would get plus three to any  travis still didnt make it though  matt so it didnt help grog pike is the only one thats near you that wouldve gotten the benefit  laura that wouldve gotten pike up to one of she wouldve failed one of them  matt okay so take 22 points of fire damage off or no it would be half that 11 points  take 11 /dung/ points off  liam thats for saves not on attacks right  matt correct just saves  laura so add 11 points back  marisha yeah i saved all mine you saved all yours  patrick but didnt grog roll tens and he needs a 13  matt so whatd you roll as your final rolls  travis ten ten 21 21  matt so that wouldve made 13 roll so yeah that wouldve  laura you wouldve saved on everything  travis hey so if you saved on all of them how many points of damage would you take /none/  matt all of them would have been 56  travis got it 56  laura trinket still wouldve failed three just to put that out there he rolled so poorly  matt even with the plus three  laura even with the plus three trinket would not have gotten up to 13 on three of those  travis thank you kerr  taliesin you know ive been led to believe that bears had more affinity with dealing with forest  fires in general i feel its just this is definitely a problem  liam somewhere sam is laughing  /none/ laura oh poor trinket hes just  liam hes good at cuddles  taliesin do you have a bald bear  marisha with a little singed hair  matt all right percy that ends your turn  travis percy does that end your turn  matt vex youre up  laura oh im up okay im going to shoot them im going to shoot the one closer to you  matt okay there you go  laura that definitely hits  matt okay  laura 16 damage plus three lightning damage  matt okay got it  laura and then /none/ fuck me i hunters mark him  matt laughs okay he has been hunters marked  laura i attack him again natural 20  cheering  matt well there you go  taliesin i was gonna say somehow a skull is giving you shade and now hes not  laura 20 plus eight lightning damage plus eight hunters mark  cause you double all your dice right  matt you double the dice yeah so thats 20 plus eight plus another eight  laura so 28 plus eight lightning damage  matt yeah that secondary arrow happens to just hit /none/ right on the suture at the side of the skull  and as it hits the arrow cuts through and causes the skull to crack in half and you hear this kind  of shriek and the laughter fades as it pulls back and the flame just flickers out and the two  pieces of bone just clatter to the ground and break across the stone  laura i move away from him into the oh on the opposite side of percy  matt okay so this way 30 you can get about there all right that ends your turn /none/ vex grog  youre up  travis yells i run at the last remaining skull  liam hey you guys  travis in a rage  matt you get right up to it  travis id like to play teeball please  matt okay go for it  travis with this new dwarven thrower shouldve tried throwing it but too late for that with  reckless great weapon master please  matt go for it  travis 33 minus five is 28  matt that hits you dont add the extra d8 since you only get that when you throw /none/ it  travis right shit wait yeah 26  matt 26 damage  travis no im sorry the second hit was 26 to hit  matt oh i see what was the damage on the first one  travis i didnt do it yet  matt oh okay  travis now ive done it what the fuck is that  matt welcome to d8s motherfucker  travis i know thats a six plus im raging so 20 points of damage  matt okay you slam across the side of the skull it slams against the side of the wall where /none/ you  hit it and as it rights itself you go with your second attack which does hit roll damage for  that one  marisha what the fuck is that its a number  travis 19  matt 19 hits or 19 damage sorry whack you slam it again this time it falls to the ground  and picks itself back up the flames brightening once again the anger as its jaw clacks open  coming towards your face  marisha its still alive kill it  travis i dont have a third attack  matt yeah hes not /none/ frenzied  travis with a bonus action can i attempt to use my boots of feral leaping and leap  laughter  travis to the wall towards you yelps  taliesin he senses the allpowerful deity to the outside of it and just leaps towards matts face  travis damn you watcher of all things  matt ill just grab your mini and slam it into the ground no saves  travis flatline not like this  matt not like this  travis i just want to leap towards the wall that way so im not in the same line /none/  matt okay so go ahead and make your athletics check since you are raging  you have advantage on it  travis oh cool i dont need it its 26  matt okay so you there you go  travis i expected you to die  matt all right this is alluras turn she sees currently at the moment that the heavily damaged  flame skull and theres nothing else in the immediate vicinity she glances past steps over  past kerrek and says shall you or shall i  patrick be my guest  matt youre too kind /none/ and with one hand on your shoulder and her staff in the other she thrusts  it forward and you watch as four what looks like small beads of arcane energy go rocketing out from  the top of the staff and arcing around each other as they swell with power and force all  slam multiple times into the side the magic missiles dealing five ten 15 four fours in a  row 20 four fours in a row and thats not quite enough to finish it  laura how is this ghost so strong  matt its taken /none/ 59 points of damage you watch as  travis i forgot to add ten  matt to each roll well  travis i mean you can add 20  matt so well say given that circumstance  travis sorry  matt its okay given the fact that it literally had one hit point left  travis she got it  matt it had one hit point left so as the four missiles slam into the side of the skull the  final one hits and its jaw gets blown off as the rest of the skull just turns to ash /none/ against  the stonework and slowly rests across the side the combat coming to an end in that moment  laura good times guys  taliesin every week every week for two years weve been playing this game for two years  liam its gonna be amazing when were level one again well go i hit it for three points  cheering  travis we came from that way right  matt you came from this way yes  travis can i run that way  matt this way yeah  liam this is a death trap grog what are /none/ you doing  marisha why are you running backwards  travis we came from the other way  matt you went this way  travis i run the other way  matt okay so grog just goes bolting through past all of you guys  into the currently unexplored  liam i start flying with him grog grog grog we dont know if everything has been fucked up  will you just wait a second  laura check for traps check for traps  travis braking noises  taliesin at the edge of the map  liam wow youre learning /none/  matt you just caught him as he moved past the partially collapsed part of the wall where the one  skull was trying to hide  marisha pike do we have maybe like a group heal cause im half hit points  after flaming night riders  laura yeah  liam im gonna check for traps past where the gate was 20 or 30 feet  laura some sort of healing thing  travis how many of those did you fail  marisha i passed all of them one with a nat 20  travis oh youre at half /none/ your hit points  marisha look man we cant all be grog the barbarian  laura do we wanna okay if we all keep charging in that spell that we just did lasts for a  minute thought raishan was around she was not so weve got less than a minute left on that  level eight there  marisha that gives us advantage on all saving throws  matt which actually now that i think about it i need you to roll four concentration checks on  that one for pike so four constitution saving throws  laura you /none/ know what they did a good job of keeping us from all dying just then though  liam yes they did yes that was not wasted advantage here we go  laura natural 20 18 19 11 11  patrick actually that 11 had plus three  matt yeah okay so she maintains concentration but you have roughly 50 seconds 45 seconds  liam lets go right now right now  laura were not gonna be able to get to her in a minute yall  liam is there anything ahead of me as i look with my 19  /none/ matt okay so as theyre having this conversation you push past you dont notice  anything trapped but about 30 feet from where the iron door was as youre scoping the floor just  turns to darkness and as you peek over you see now a set of stairs are descending  liam but no traps  matt no traps  liam do we want to keep moving or do we want to pause  laura if we take a rest we can rest up and heal  patrick i would like to have a short rest right now so /none/ we can top off  liam okay let the spell go then hit dice  laura okay yeah we use our hit dice cause we all got half of them back  marisha how long short rest  matt short rest is about anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour  laura we can scry and see if raishan totally knows that were here  patrick unless theres some sort of big healing mojo but i am really gimped  travis yeah lets just use our hit dice save the big heals  marisha i mean i could burn a /none/ mass cure wounds and heal us  travis we havent even fought the dragon yet  laura yeah thats the thing  liam for all we know we fucked ourselves with that skull earlier  taliesin so it wouldnt matter so whats 40 minutes  marisha i dont know i feel like that was gonna happen  taliesin yeah were good lets take a  marisha shes a smart woman the least that we can assume is that she knows  liam we havent outsmarted her yet  laura shes probably already bamfed out yall  taliesin you can find /none/ out really easily  laura oh yeah while were resting im gonna detect dragons and see if shes still around  matt okay you sense the same three dragon presences in the vicinity  laura same spot oh all right  marisha thats something  liam whispers tell us all your secrets  travis nine times a day playa  matt dont forget you guys using your hit dice you get scanlans song of rest  laura okay so what is that  matt its an additional d12  marisha song of rest is 1d12 healing points  taliesin on /none/ top of  matt on top of whatever you healed you then get an additional d12  travis i got a 12 right there thats fucking sweet  marisha plus 12 plus 1d8 plus sorry plus 1d12 right he adds a 1d12  taliesin nine  matt thats overall not on each dice yeah just overall  marisha hit dice  travis do we go back up to heroes feast hit points or not anymore  matt yeah heroes feast is addition to your maximum hit points  travis i heal 55 hit points with this d12 monster  laura /none/ oh my god i rolled so good  travis im just one below where i was  matt which is what  travis 235  matt 235 for grog percy where are you at  taliesin im still rolling  laura i went all the way back to my maximum so 115 is what im at now  matt okay vax you didnt take any damage kerrek what are you at  patrick still rolling  matt okay no worries  taliesin im rolling really shittily  marisha im not doing great  liam scanlan helped out with that  /dung/ matt he did yeah  liam sings when the blight has come and the land is dark and your health is down to 23 hp  travis oh youre doing great thats great  laura that was good  travis were missing the high soprano tonal quality  liam cant do it cant do it  taliesin wow im down a lot  marisha im gonna burn my last few hit dice  taliesin im at 140 im not at the top of my peak  marisha im at 95  matt 95 got it  taliesin is it possible /none/ god i have instructions on how to run scanlan and im  debating how to best do that  laura oh i went up to 117 because i forgot i had the extra 15  matt heroes feast yeah  liam is he going to do a bump or a thing  marisha would he do a bump right now he probably would wouldnt he  taliesin i was going to say according to the instructions i was given  marisha probably  laura pikes back at 115  taliesin well thats the thing i want to make sure i /none/ can do this in a way so i dont take  anything from him later  marisha is he wait hang on wait i feel like he texted no he didnt  taliesin he really yeah no im gonna try  travis a number give him a number  marisha hang on how many bumps of suude does he have left  matt one  travis save it  marisha would he do it for after raishan or before  travis after  taliesin before  liam before i think too  taliesin yeah i was given specific instructions  /none/ marisha i think he would do it before too  taliesin hes gonna push a little forward up to the stairs get away from the rest of the group  matt thatll be going up to where vax is  taliesin oh then hes going to push a little far back and just  matt okay so scanlan backs away  laura wait scanlan gave us an extra nine hit points  matt extra d12  taliesin which is nine hit points  laura nine im higher than 117 then im onewhatever 126  marisha so he has one hit /none/ of suude left  taliesin yeah hes gonna get himself quietly away i think hes had it packed already so  theres not gonna be a big elaborate hes just gonna  marisha holy shit this feels so weird  matt to byproxy do this yeah okay  marisha it feels so dirty  matt go ahead and roll a constitution saving throw  taliesin im not gonna sully it with my good dice im gonna use one of my crappy dice  marisha he gave us instructions  taliesin this is i guess the most stoner die i have /none/ for this  so okay constitution saving throw  marisha come on just straight constitution  taliesin 19 oh saving throw 19  matt 19 all right great as scanlan takes the flute and takes in the fumes of the charburned  suude the familiar burn and chemical flavor fills his lungs and as he exhales this fine brown  smoke emits from his lungs and his vision clarifies suddenly and he feels this elevated  sense of energy and power in his mind for the next hour scanlan has one sorcery point that he  can spend as the /none/ sorcerer metamagic class and has access to the extended spell metamagic ability  liam do you know what that means i kind of do  marisha okay unextended spell metamagic so what does that buy us  matt so he has one point period that he can ever spend for the next hour  marisha he has one sorcery point  matt correct  marisha wait how do you spell sorcery how do you spell sorcery  matt and basically he can spend it to double the duration of a spell as he casts it  marisha he can double /none/  liam thats the only thing thats within reach of one sorcery point right  matt thats the suude gives him access to a specific metamagic based on the color of the  suude and he gets a point the more you use to get more points the higher the dc gets and the  closer you get to overdosing  taliesin ah i love it this is the worst thing ever  marisha so he could theoretically die by doing this  liam hey man its just another version of craven edge  taliesin no its great yeah this /none/ is weirdly  travis yeah except i had it all under control  laura sure  marisha so wait he can double the length of one spell  matt yeah a single spell that has a duration he can use that sorcery point to double the duration  of that spell  marisha the duration of one spell  matt correct  marisha and it could be wait question  matt so if its one minute concentration it can be two minutes concentration  marisha what if its one action could it be two actions he could do it back /none/ to back  matt no the duration not the casting time those are different the duration is once you cast  it how long it lasts before it expires  laura so like a mansion we could have for two days  taliesin twoday mansion  matt actually no it says specifically as part of the metamagic ability that it has a maximum of  24 hours so if it already has a 24 hour duration you cannot  laura just kidding  marisha so only if its below 24 hours  taliesin the large print giveth and the small /none/ print taketh away  laughter  matt thats a beautiful quote  taliesin tom waits everybody tom waits bless him  liam tom waits voice whats percy building in there  travis patrick how much did you heal brother  patrick im up to 94  matt all righty  taliesin i dig this we got this  marisha one sorcery double okay all right all right holy shit  liam i found nothing in the further area right  matt no traps you came to the edge of the stairs that lead down for about 20 or so feet /none/ and then  progress an even path and then disappear below what your visual is able to see from above  marisha keyleth is going to just before this short rest is going to  give one cure wounds to herself  matt okay go for it  marisha just to top me off  liam kerr is your hammer still aglow  patrick if you want light i can do light  liam i wanna know if its aglow right now did you have a chance to pop it out  patrick it probably is unless somebody told me /none/ to turn it off  liam okay so i figured it was probably still on  matt yeah its still currently being the central source of light in this room  liam how far down the stairs do i see from where i am  matt from where you are you can see all the way to the bottom of the 20 feet of stairs but the  roof of the tunnel cuts off the rest of the path so you have to go out further  to look out where it goes  marisha keyleth is at 116 hit /none/ points  matt cool got it  liam put that out please kerr  patrick okay i snuff it  liam im gonna go stealth and im gonna go down to the bottom of the steps and ive already  checked for traps oh no i didnt up to this point so im gonna check for traps as i go down  the steps  matt okay stealth first  liam which is 25 am i still under pass without a trace  matt no because she cast  liam 25  matt 25 okay and then make an investigation /none/ check  liam natural 20 for that  matt you make your way down the stairs into the next bit of the hallway no traps the stonework  here now is getting a little more refined the further you go and as you look out the hallway  you have another 25 30 feet of this 20footwide 20foottall hallway before it seems to just end  and drop off and you can see what looks to be the gap in another wall  about 25 feet across from that  liam okay so hallway goes a ways then theres nothing /none/ and then 20 feet past that  matt and then just a wall on the other side  liam so a gap and then a wall  matt yeah looks like it goes down or up youd have to get closer to get more detail  taliesin i keep meaning to build something for something like this i just havent had the time  laura oh you know what darling dont worry you can use the carpet  liam on the earring team theres a passage down ahead of me theres no traps i dont think  laura so lets /none/ walk up there  liam yeah catch up with me and then pause and then either i or my sister and i will move ahead  taliesin and just let us know which direction you think we should head vex  laura of course  liam did you mean vax or did you mean vex just want to be really sure because people make  mistakes a lot  laura they do they really do  taliesin i do i know i do that wasnt a mistake though  liam very similar  taliesin love you madly  liam all /none/ right i know youre talking to vax  taliesin that was for vex vax which one  matt trinket can use his own hit dice to heal if you wanted to  laura okay then he healed himself while we were rested but hes in the necklace so that we can  fly if we have to  matt thats fine okay so yeah you can go ahead and heal him up vax you move ahead  liam yeah  matt okay as they start catching up with you you hear them stepping down the stairs behind you  you /none/ come up to the edge and now what you see is a 25foot circular almost cylinder there is a  ceiling maybe about five feet above you and nothing there but what you do see is about a  threefootwide spiral staircase that just leads down and down and down and you cannot see where  it ends at the bottom  liam is it a staircase where im forced to walk or is it stairs on the walls and empty space down  the center of it  matt empty space down the center of it and its just /none/ a twoandahalf or threefootwide  staircase that goes along the edge and thats all you have to walk on  liam ah im going to float out above it and look for traps down the cylinder  matt okay  taliesin why dont you tie the endless rope to yourself so we can pull you up  liam ive got wings  laura but theyre only out for an hour dear  liam 18  matt 18 okay as you slowly drift down keeping your wings you hover further down maybe  incrementally ten feet at a time looking around /none/ looking at the stairs you dont notice anything  trapped it all seems pretty standard the stones are old theyre a little smooth at the edges  what were once kind of very very rigid and square protrusions from the stone seemingly have a little  rubbed off  liam at or near the bottom doorway passage  matt as you get closer to the bottom and as you get about roughly 100 feet down before you  actually reach the bottom but you begin to see below you there are right in the center of the  spiral downward /none/ a cluster of fourfootlong kind of deep brown or marooncolored iron spikes that  are all just jutting upward in slightly offkilter directions and there is a very very heavy pile  of splintered bones and longmummified dead corpses that are currently just piled up at the  base of these spikes some still impaled many of which have slowly rotted and fallen apart  liam over the earring i didnt see any traps going down but theres some bloody spikes down  here and some dead things so vex dear could you load everyone onto the carpet and get /tavern/ on your  broom and go down and just float down to the center and leave the stairs alone  laura of course the carpet can fit everybody  matt the carpet can carry 600 pounds thats roughly four people or a grog 800 pounds  laura grog and one person  travis im more than 450 so  matt grog and maybe two people  laura so i can get scanlan  matt you currently have ten people traveling with you  taliesin so heres an interesting thing we dont have an immovable bar anymore we left those both /none/  outside all right thats fine lets  laura whats at the bottom of the stairs i mean can we drop people off and go back in  liam yeah yeah yeah i can come up for pike bring her down we could just take a minute to  taliesin we could shuttle or use a rope  laura lets shuttlebus  liam and what around the spikes is there a safe portion on the floor  laura a safe landing  matt there is a very very kind of where the outer trim is of the stairway the stonework /dung/  travels around it and then underneath the stairway there is a small opening that leads into  a further passageway  laura is it safe to walk into the passageway  travis pretty sure we should just take the stairs  laura pretty sure we should just use the brazier and light it  taliesin i will avoid cardio at all costs  liam 22 investigating for traps for that passage down behind the spikes  matt okay i mean just glancing around the archway its not a closed doorway just an  archway and then a dark tunnel /none/ beyond that it does not appear to be trapped  liam all right best i can tell its okay im not 100 sure but theres dead people down here  so i just want you guys to float down the middle lets get this done  taliesin grog first  liam kay  travis im game  laura im gonna grab scanlan on the broom you grab pike  liam im shooting up yeah  laura okay and then well take the gnomes and grog down and then come back up  liam i kinda wanna move as fast as /none/ we can  matt okay so whos doing what okay you guys just threw a bunch of stuff at me right now  liam i flew back up  matt you flew back up  liam we take the gnomes down  laura yeah ive got i want pike on my broom  liam i take my little drugaddled buddy not that i know that and i float him down and i plant the  gnomes down together  matt okay so you have scanlan you have pike okay you guys enter the center area and begin  coasting downward /none/ you notice a faint blue glow above you in the ceiling as you glance up you  watch as a glyph begins to slowly  taliesin dispel magic  matt dispel magic from scanlan right now okay have scanlan go ahead and roll an ability check  taliesin ability check okay i will admit i have no idea what im doing  matt for this cause he cant cast as a reaction and this would technically be your  reaction as its already been triggered i wanna have you go ahead and roll an initiative check  marisha is this /none/ a spell attack bonus  matt huh  marisha what what ability check  matt this would be a charisma plus six and plus two its plus eight to whatever you roll but  first i need you to go ahead and roll initiative technically you would not be able to do this as  its not really a reaction  marisha his charisma plus his proficiency bonus  matt not for the ability check on dispel magic 19 thats 17 so yes go ahead and roll a d20 and  add eight  marisha big money no whammies  /none/ taliesin 21  matt 21 okay as he streaks upward and releases the spell you watch as the glyph that was  glowing  taliesin sings rock glyph you dont have to turn on the blue light rock glyph you dont have  to give our bodies to the spikes love you sam love you  travis that was good  marisha that was good get some police up in here  taliesin brought it all the way back for you  matt so you guys manage to continue all the way downward flying you place both of the gnomes /none/ at  the base safely by the spikes  liam oh man i plant him down i give him a big fat kiss right between the eyes you fucking  beautiful bastard whack  laura what was that what was that sam scanlan  taliesin i have no idea it just looked dangerous and i figured  thats better safe than sorry  laura do you think its broken now can we get other people from  taliesin sure theyll be fine  liam i fly back up right away keep this train moving  travis on the carpet im /none/ ready  liam i bring kima down  laura grog and allura can fit on the carpet right  travis just me i think  liam shes waferthin  travis what do you think me and allura or just me  matt you and one other person could probably get on  laura okay then oh god maybe could you take  when you fly back up  taliesin ill go with you cause im fine so i have options  liam is kima down  matt you go ahead and begin to carry kima down without an issue yeah /none/  laura okay i go back up and get percy we have kerr and allura and keyleth left  liam allura  matt okay so you grab allura bring her down below  liam i hope this is all right  laura i grab percy on the broom and come down  travis who else is left up top  laura i feel like wait i pause before we go down the stairs cause im like there was this  blue light that happened before and scanlan made it stop  taliesin oh no we saw  laura how do /none/ we not let that happen this time  taliesin did we make it down and nothing happened  matt most of you made it down kerrek has not come down  marisha who hasnt made it down have i made it down  matt keyleth hasnt made it down yet  laura i thought you already went down on the carpet no  matt grog hasnt made it yet so youve carried everybody but grog kerrek and keyleth  laura okay  liam i mean whatever the time is needed go up grab keyleth bring her down go up  /none/ marisha whats going on with the blue light  matt it doesnt seem to be having an effect right now  liam i just grabbed up kerrek  laura you can carry kerrek  matt kerreks pretty heavy i need you to make a strength check  liam laughs best one ever 21  laura youre so strong oh my god youve been lifting bro  matt its a bit of a strain with the weight of his armor and getting up in his years versus your  tiny halfelf frame but you do manage to bring him down without /none/ issue  liam strained the raven queen sends her regards  laura grog  patrick im getting to hug all the boys in this adventure  laughter  patrick this is kerreks best day ever  taliesin somebodys got a coupon for a back massage welcome to vox machina you seem tense  marisha thats what we pay you in  liam im sure we just killed ten minutes doing all that shit  laura groggy can you come down  travis is it just me and keyleth  matt yeah its just the two of you up there no /none/ he brought keyleth down so its just you  travis okay first i stand on the carpet i say lift  matt the carpet takes you off the ground you have to kinda get your  travis no i lay down flat and i grab the edges of the carpet and i go okay  and try to go down  matt okay you go into a pseudonosedive its thrilling and scary at the same moment and as  youre going up grog just goes past you  travis stop stop stop  matt and it just barely coasts past /none/ the spikes and lets you fine on the side  taliesin its about the speed of the childrens rides at fantasyland at disneyland right  matt yeah its not super fast magic carpet can go about as fast as a person especially this  size the smaller they are the faster they are this is a very big one but not very fast  liam all right vax does a barrel roll heads back down lands and lets start looking around  again all right stealth traps still vigilant  matt indeed  liam for stealth thats a 28 and /none/ investigating for traps ooh thats a one and im not gonna  use my luck on it  matt all righty  liam im not seems clear were good i am badass  matt so as you guys have reached the bottom of this cylindrical chamber you follow suit one by  one which by the way just so i know going forward whats the marching order right now  liam vax in the front  patrick im by grog  laughter  travis yeah baby  matt grog where are you at  travis ill be behind the twins /none/  marisha ill be behind grog kerr with grog  matt percy where are you at  taliesin i think probably maybe scanlan and pike are in front of me and then im probably hanging  back with kima and allura just sort of ready to i want to be at a distance  laura and trinkets  matt trinket is out now  laura trinkets still in my necklace hes healing in the necklace  matt okay so moving forward following vaxs lead  laura im just gonna stay on the broom and just kind of very close to /none/ the ground but not touching  the ground  matt okay so the hallways probably 20 feet wide and 15 feet tall as you push forward the walls  are chiseled rather roughly and about 30 feet forward ahead of you you can see it ends at a  crosssection of what looks like a very deep ravine both above and below there is an  underground chasm here that stretches both to the right and left though youd have to get to the  very edge to kind of see how far it goes its about 60 feet across /none/ to the other side and you  can see what looks to be another entranceway to another hallway and there is a taut rope bridge  bolted to each side leading across  travis we should just use that  laura totally  marisha that looks safe  liam jeez we just blew so much time on that fucking stairwell  marisha guys in latin jehovah starts with an i  laura its a leap of faith  liam shouldve sent you to the marx brothers  taliesin when he said chiseled rather roughly he meant brad pitt  laura /none/ how long until your wings stop working  liam i dont know ten or 15 i guess  laura zoinks  liam zoinks  matt your wings went out before the battle and you took a long rest your wings are pretty much  done now 30 minutes to an hour  liam yeah i thought we were cutting it close like it could be  five or ten minutes at this point  matt between riding everyone up and down im letting you know right now mr already flying  everywhere your wings are about expended  liam all /none/ right should i stand on the ground  matt thats up to you do you want to keep flying until theyre gone or do you want to sit there  liam im gonna fly to the other side of the bridge right now  matt okay  laura im gonna go with him on my broom  matt okay so you get about five feet out before the wings go fsh  liam over nothing  matt looking down you see darkness and theres a few stalagtites that  liam i throw a dagger at the other side of the /none/ chasm 60 feet sharpshooter into the side near  the top whisper  laura this is why i went on the broom i was gonna catch you  liam as an attack  matt youre attacking just the wall above or  liam theres a cliff facing me right yeah just into the rock wall of the cliff 20  matt 20 okay the dagger hits the edge and you appear right at the edge of the cliff youre  gonna try to reach and grab make a dexterity saving throw  liam 22  matt okay so you grab /tavern/ and get up on the other side  laura jesus small heart attack over here  matt you didnt even really fall for a moment vex youre floating across and it feels strange  going across theres no wind but the broom is acting extremely wobbly and the way you control  it and maneuver around you feel almost drunk but youre not this is not acting properly  laura im gonna turn around and go back to the  matt okay so you head back  laura that was weird it doesnt feel right  taliesin okay im going /none/ to grab on to the bridge im going to test it im going to step to  see if its real im checking it  matt okay you take your hands there holding and you put your foot out onto the wood and its  sturdy its strong  travis laughs you bastard  marisha i go up to the edge of the rope bridge that percys now standing on i lean down and on  the dirt i cast druidcraft can i craft some vines to help reinforce the bridge  matt with druidcraft you can create some small /none/ vines that wrap around it and it might help in  some regard but not a lot druidcraft is a very limited cantrip  taliesin im gonna grab one end of the infinite rope and im gonna hand the other end of the  infinite rope to someone whos staying i think that i pose a good chance of getting across this  safely im going to make a run for it well not a run  travis are you literally going to run  taliesin no im going to walk gingerly  travis oh so youre gonna make a /none/ walk for it  taliesin im tying the rope that may be one of the smartest things youve ever said i dont  actually have a retort for it on any level  travis i dont know why what is retort okay  taliesin it means if i die you win im going to tie the infinite rope to myself and hand it off to  grog oh god im handing it to grog and im going to start gingerly stepping out onto the  bridge being very careful and checking with each step thats its real and looking for /none/ weird  glyphs or signs or anything out of the ordinary  laura percy be careful  matt make a dexterity check  marisha as this happens scanlan sings hey percy youre so fine youre so fine you blow my  mind hey percy hey percy hey percy youre so fine youre so fine you blow my mind with your  gun with your gun and then he gets a point of inspiration  matt all right so you get your d12 inspiration die  travis marisha that was really nice  marisha thank you i feel like i had /none/ the same witty repartee as sam riegel  liam okay okay now just smile and make the smile as big as manhattan  matt dexterity saving throw  taliesin thats not bad thats 22  matt thats really good all right so as you start stepping out you feel this shift in the  space and you grab on to the edges of the  taliesin im also using my boots and im gluing them to whatever the yeah  matt right and as you glue the boots there thats really what solidifies you in place and  youre still /tavern/ there on the bridge without a problem  taliesin are things just getting weird out here  matt it feels weird you cant quite understand whats transpiring but it just feels weird  laura allura it felt like almost i was drunk as i was flying across that do you know  matt i dont think its drunk per se its just that youre not used to flying in that direction  and she points out towards the ravine and you watch as percy whos kind of holding onto the  ravine feet solid his hair is just up  /none/ liam gravity is fucked  taliesin well this will be fine is gravity flipped  matt as you hear this conversation it seems that way yeah  taliesin im going to spiderclimb im just going to use my spiderclimb boots and im going  to make my way with the rope  matt you do so make it across the way the wood shivers a little bit shifts beneath your feet  being pulled upward from your weight you guys watch as the bridge that was once taut is now  arcing up and following percy as he moves across /none/ his weight pulling it upward  marisha thats cool  laura so can i try flying out there knowing the gravitys shifted does it feel okay to fly out  like that  matt as you fly out and spin yourself underneath yes you do actually manage to fly  essentially barrel roll across and manage to make it across to your brother without an issue  laura oh i didnt want to go all the way across i just wanted to test it so i could help bring  other people across  taliesin weve got now a third /none/ rope we can literally just clip people to the rope now  liam it was like poledancing but in space upsidedown  taliesin we can use the rope we just made as a clipped rappel rope can we thats a thing that  we can do  laura potentially  taliesin if everybody wants to try and cross we can actually we now have an unencumbered piece  that we can use to get people across  travis im gonna jump  liam no no thats a bad idea grog you are very hefty and the gravity turns upsidedown  /none/ taliesin theres probably spikes up there  laura grog did you see how i barrelrolled on my broom  travis yeah do i twist in the air  laura yeah you should just do the same thing on the carpet  liam wait what if he took the carpet and hung off the bottom of it on the first side and then as  he made his way over hed be all right you know what i mean  laura i dont know  matt vex vax and keyleth as you guys are having this conversation something catches the  /none/ corner of your eye and you watch something just go tss just whizz past from the bottom of the  ravine to the top  liam we saw that we saw that  matt you saw something quickly just go by  laura can i get a better look can i look and see if i see it again  matt yeah the three of you guys make a perception check as you kind of come up to the  edge and look  liam 26  marisha 14  laura is this related to dragons  matt this is /none/ not related to dragons  laura then that is a 21  liam 26  matt all right so youre seeing little things just right out of the middle of the light you can  see something shifting above and below you you guys have a little better view you still cant  quite see the length of your darkvision is too far for you to see what is below you or  necessarily whats above  marisha can i as a quick reaction grab the rope bridge  matt yeah so youre still off to the side just holding /none/ onto the bridge okay you are beginning  to watch what looks to be figures humanoid bodies  taliesin oh i have a theory  matt just tumbling past one of them hits the edge of the bridge and it keeps spinning off as it  disappears into the darkness above  taliesin i have a weird theory im going to grab what do i have that i can do this with  liam but they look like spirits falling upwards  matt you watch a couple more go by and they are nearly skeletal bodies falling upward but as /none/ you  watch a couple more go by theyre limp somewhat but still moving as they scoot past  laura lets just get across here shall we  liam im going to use divine sense now just to confirm  matt you wait about a minute or so before one comes close enough to hit the sense but there is  an undead energy that passes past and both you and kerr have this moment from across the ravine  from each other seeing this  patrick gonna throw up the horns  liam thats me to you man  /none/ taliesin try and clock them see if its the same bodies over and over again if its an infinite  loop of falling  marisha an infinite loop of falling  laura okay so i wanna get a good look at one of them as they go by  liam oh its a gif  marisha six seconds  matt three or four more stumble past and theyre getting more and more rapid and theyre different  sizes they do not appear to be the same bodies  laura i pick up pike and try to barrel roll across  /none/ matt okay barrel roll across as youre making it across three more come tumbling up two of  them too far away but one of them does reach out with its arms as it tumbles past you and swats  out to try and grab you i need you to make an acrobatics check  liam you got this oh you got such a bonus come on girl  travis such a bonus huh such a bonus look at matts face look at his face  taliesin oh fuck no  marisha oh come on no come on  liam /none/ do they both make that roll  matt shes the one driving the broom shes having to try and maneuver  taliesin i was about to interject and i know that i didnt make that fast enough but at some  point i would already like to be moving to interject in this  matt right as youre watching them start going across you get a step out onto the bridge  taliesin im not going onto the bridge im pulling out my gun  laura oh wait pike has a thing that she can help people with their  /none/ travis war gods blessing  matt thats an attack roll  laura damn it  matt war gods dont help you survive they help you kill shit  travis do what youre gonna do mercer  taliesin i was gonna start skeetshooting at some point so  matt understood but before we get to that so the creature grabs you and essentially grapples  you in the moment as that happens the momentum of pulling you up causes the broom to shift out of  whack and you begin to careen in a slight circle i need you and pike /none/  to both make strength saving throws  patrick how far away is this  matt theyre about 30 feet from you  marisha what about from keyleth  matt about the same so you guys are on the other side of the ravine  laura shes got a plus four on strength nine for me  liam 13 for pike  matt so okay so pikes on the broom with you you get grabbed and yanked off the broom pike  manages to hold the broom but currently pike is not the current driver of it and so shes /none/  clutching a broom thats just floating in the gravity you watch as both pike and vex go from  careening off to tumbling upward into the darkness above  marisha are they both attached to the broom  matt no vex is pulled off the broom  taliesin but shes still tethered  matt shes still tethered yeah  marisha does keyleth have an action  matt right now the two of you can both make an action  taliesin all right my first action i was just pulling to try and skeetshoot and sharpshoot with  bad news /none/ to hit the undead that had grappled her and i assume i have spend a grit to get him to let  go to shove him off  matt because of the nature of the rapid movement you are at a disadvantage on this attack  marisha you still have the inspiration right  taliesin i still have that d12 inspiration  liam matt watching this im going to pull whisper out and watch to see my sister falling  through the air and if i see her falling im going to throw the dagger at her  matt okay /none/ shes falling  liam down or up  matt up  liam im watching him and im watching her and if she goes how far away is she from me  matt right now shes about 30 feet out from the ravine and now tumbling upward shes about 50  feet from you  marisha cause hes on the other side correct  taliesin oh for fucks sake really  matt misfire  taliesin misfire  marisha all righty keyleths gonna go seeing percy misfire keyleth is going to grab a grasping  vine on the side of the wall /none/ and shes going to go for that broom cause both pike and her are  still grabbing onto that broom yeah  liam and im throwing whisper at vex im doing it  matt the vine unfortunately only has a range of 30 feet  marisha you said she was 30 feet away  matt shes 30 feet out from the center of the ravine and is now 15 20 feet up in the air  marisha can she not hit the wall get a vine off the side of the wall and bring her down  matt the opposite /none/ side maybe  marisha ive got a 60foot range to this spell plus 30 feet from the grasping vine right or is  it 30 and 30 i thought you were still grabbing onto the  laura im tethered to the broom  marisha to the broom and pikes still grabbing onto the broom yeah im going for the broom  come on man  laughter  matt look im trying to work out you guys do a lot of things really fast im trying im working  with you so please bear with me on this  marisha grasping /none/ vine what what  liam youre like a loan officer  matt i wouldnt recommend doing that or i wont give you a chance to even do it  dont taunt the dm  liam i want to sell you this house but theres some shit we need to go over  matt so im going to ask you keyleth to go ahead and make just a general dexterity check  marisha just general dex what  matt this is how fast youre able to enchant a spell which requires an incantation and the  release of the spells effect /none/ thus summoning the vine and causing it to lash out this is just a  general base dc i need you to go ahead and just roll and add your dexterity modifier  laura you got it you got it  marisha i love you  laura i love you  marisha that was a natural 19 so that is plus my dex which is plus two so 21 hah  laura dont hah dont hah the dm  marisha i mean yells grunts  matt so as bad news misfires you watch as the front of it just this /dung/ burst of black smoke bursts  outward and this look of utter horror on percys face keyleth rushes out and grabbing the edge of  the rope bridge to get enough of a reach out there you watch as her hair lifts up and part of  her body begins to just drift upward but she holds on and reaches out with the staff and  using the strength of her force of will the edge of the stone above the ravine cracks open and  suddenly you watch where there is no life a piercing flash of dark green /none/ shoots outward a  vine freshly grown from the edge of the stonework reaches out and grabs wrapping around the broom  itself and holding it taut you watch as the vine and the entire group shifts upward youre  suddenly pulled youre still grappled by this undead zombielike corpse and pike is currently  clutching onto the broom as hard as she can as you both impact at the end with your weight and the  creatures weight i now get to see if the  laura vine holds  matt well not the vine the vine magically holds /none/ its the chain that attaches you to the  broom yeah okay so that holds it goes taut youre held there the creatures still clutching  you right now  laura are my arms restrained  matt your arms are held to yeah actually cause youre still held there i want you to go  ahead and make another acrobatics check  liam holy fuck  laura acrobatics thats pike acrobatics 25  matt 25 so it does not progress into restrained youre still grappled its still holding on to  you but you manage to swivel out of its /none/ grasp as its trying to pull you in and its starting to  try and bite into you as you glance upward now that youre drifting dangling roughly 60 feet up  you look up and you can see what is the top of the ravine and it is a writhing mass of hundreds  and hundreds of undead corpses that are all reaching out for you their differentboned claws  all extended going rasping trying to just pull you towards them into empty air as you dangle  looking up into that  liam this is fine  laura /none/ oh my god  marisha everythings okay  laura everythings fine you guys  matt at which point the vine pulls the broom pike you and the creature up towards the edge of  the wall so youre still 30 feet up but youre slammed into the side of the wall now the vine  is just holding the broom taut against the edge of the rocks  marisha sorry  laura no i love you youre amazing can i just take out i just have a dagger can i pull out my  dagger and try to jam it /none/ up into the zombies under his chin  matt go for it its going to attempt to bite attack you by the way which it does not do with  a two just getting your armor gnawing on the leather  laura oh its all zombie drool i am really bad at regular attacks what do i add to this  matt you add your dexterity and your proficiency modifier so it would be plus ten i think  laura so 20  matt okay yeah so you jam it with the dagger go ahead and roll damage thats 1d4 /none/ plus your  dexterity modifier  laura oh plus my dexterity i didnt roll a 20 i rolled  matt its a d4 plus five is what youre rolling for damage  laura eight  matt okay so eight damage you jam the dagger up into its jaw and throat and it slaps it out of  the way you can see its damaged but its still holding on the creatures now grabbing onto you  and slamming you into the wall best it can  laura what is pike doing  matt pike is just holding onto the broom /none/ right now shes going to attempt to actually what  she would do in this moment would be turn undead cause thats what clerics do  laura i didnt even see that spell wheres that spell  matt its not a spell its her channel divinity ability  patrick yeah its channel divinity but i couldnt do it from the edge of the pit  its 30 feet  matt yeah you have to be closer from there okay so it has to make a saving throw which it  does not make so as you look over and this /none/ zombies biting at you and youre trying to jam at  it pike whos holding onto the broom grabs the symbol of sarenrae from around her neck and looks  up and just closes her eyes for a second and as they flash open again theres no pupils just  white bright vibrant radiant eyes this small shockwave bursts off her and you watch as the  zombie goes gasps just turns into ash and disintegrates its body just tumbling in chunks  and pieces up into the ravine above you  laura so i would look down at pike /none/  matt yes and then up at where the zombie went pike is below you still holding onto the broom  laura youre amazing that was amazing this was a mistake how do we get down  matt i dont know keyleth  marisha im holding on man  liam wheres the carpet wheres the carpet wheres the carpet  taliesin the carpet is not what we need  matt a few more corpses start tumbling up  taliesin the rope that is currently tied at the other end of the ravine where theyre currently  above us right  /none/ matt yes theyre about 30 feet above you guys on the opposite side  taliesin im going to try and reverse rappel with the rope the other end of the endless rope  up to them  marisha also as a bonus action i can switch the direction of the vine to lash out at the same  creature as a bonus action so can i grasp a vine and hand them off and stairstep them down  matt no the vine is attached at a base its almost like it grew out of the ground so what  grasping /none/ vine allows you to do is you can wherever its based at it pulls it to it  marisha right it just says until the spell ends you can direct the vine to lash out at the  same creature on my bonus action so  matt it doesnt do damage what it does is it just grasps and pulls towards it so what you can  do is each turn you can change the target if you change the target its gonna release the broom  and theyre both gonna tumble up  marisha well i dont wanna do /none/ that but i cant change the origin of the vine  matt not without casting the spell again  taliesin im gonna reversebatman this shit  matt all right so you start reverserappelling up the side whats everyone else doing  liam wheres grog and the flying carpet  matt grog kerrek and keyleth are all still on the other side with kima and allura theyre all  on the other side of the ravine  liam get off the rug get off the rug get off the rug now please  marisha im not on the rug  liam /none/ isnt anyone on the rug thats why i asked  matt the rug is still with them its on the other side  liam back where it was shit  matt nobodys taken the rug across  taliesin the rugs a terrible idea right now anyway  travis i cant get on the rug so one of you lighter people will you go get those two  please  taliesin im just im going up super fucking fast  matt okay so you rappel up the side while theyre holding on there one more corpse tumbles  up past its /none/ going to attempt to  laura can i no i cant do that im like floating basically basically im like falling  and just held onto a broom thats being held onto the wall  matt right now if you were to try and take a shot you could try but youd be at disadvantage  for all your attacks  laura i want to try to any zombies or undead that come near us i want to try to shoot them  and at least ricochet  matt okay well one comes tumbling past what are you doing kerr /none/  patrick if nobody else on this side is getting on this carpet then i will  matt okay so kerrek hops on the carpet and it begins to lift above the ground  marisha can i get on it as well and still maintain the concentration on my grasping vine  travis but why would you do that because youve gotta put two people on that carpet  marisha what  travis were trying to put them on the carpet right  taliesin it can hold four or five people  marisha im trying to hold the concentration on /none/ their grasping vine so they dont get fucked so  im going to get on the carpet  travis you know if you get hit by something that falls  marisha thats true but i have advantage on concentration checks these days  matt allura  laura oh my god  taliesin hang on im coming  laura yeah no thats the thing percys on his way to save us so you guys just try to hold onto  that carpet  taliesin get across we need people to pull us back  marisha also grasping vines not a concentration /none/ spell its a bonus action and no no its a  concentration spell  matt allura watching this happen grabs kima and dimension doors across to the other side sets  kima aside and just stays there waiting carefully  marisha scanlan does have dimension door  laura he does he could do it for himself  matt and one other person of equal size which is only pike and kima technically but kimas  already gotten across  laura that sucks cause scanlan couldve taken kima  taliesin scanlan also has a plan if you guys are about to /none/ really fucking die  matt so youre just waiting kerrek and keyleth are going across are you guys going just directly  across or are you going towards vex and  patrick well if they were to fall im heading wherever below that is toward them to offer  support if they lose it im also ready to turn undead if a big cluster of these things comes  towards us  marisha im maintaining concentration while floating next to kerr on the carpet  matt all right so you guys as the carpet heads out you hearing the carpet /none/ as you move forward  kerrek you barrel roll the carpet and begin heading upward to float underneath where pike and  vex will be as you begin heading upward its funny you mention that what were singular bodies  tumbling upward are now groupings four or five almost chained together like these small balls of  just limbs and bones and gnashing zombified teeth begin just falling sounds upward one of them  slams into the bridge and scatters out sending a number of bodies spinning outward broken arms and  limbs from the impact the bridge itself cracks /none/ a bit and you watch as the center of it is still  being held by a rope but it is currently not overly walkable without holding the rope to get across  taliesin you can use the rope just to steady yourself on the carpet  matt one of these clusters starts making its way upwards towards where the carpet is  patrick if im steering the carpet can i dodge away from this because even if i turn it they  will have velocity  matt correct you have not driven a magic carpet before i would ask /none/ you to go ahead and lets  see for this make an intelligence check  patrick jesus is my copilot  laughter  matt go ahead and make an intelligence check just a straight d20  plus your intelligence modifier  patrick the first fucking character i make where i lowball intelligence  laughter  patrick oh that is a just straight  matt well plus your modifier whatever that is  patrick wait my proficiency modifier  matt your intelligence modifier  patrick oh yeah no thats an eight  matt okay so moving this across youre basically watching /none/ this thing come careening  upwards and youre trying to shift out of the way to maintain momentum and have this not impact you  but both the nerves of whats happening the unfamiliarity with the change in gravity and not  running a carpet before you move out of the way just as it slams into the upper corner causing  the carpet to shift and quake oh man  patrick can i push keyleth hard enough to get her to the other side  matt you guys were heading upward so if you were to kick her off /none/ she would probably still arc  upward at this point you guys are essentially in theory youre below the ravine if this were  normal gravity  marisha how close are we to  matt you guys are about 30 feet across cause the movement speed of the carpet is if i recall  from what i told you right it was 30 feet  marisha so were not close to pike and vex  matt not yet youre halfway there  taliesin just so you know the second my feet hit the stone of the upper wall im going /none/ to hold  on i no longer have to repose ive got the spider im going to  doubledash towards them with the rope  matt so as they get hit percy has just made it up the wall to you and pike  taliesin and im just tying them to the rope  matt doubledash got you there  marisha if kerrs kicking me off im reaching for pike and the broom and still trying to maintain  concentration while trying to reach for those guys  matt okay well first and foremost first and foremost oh man this /none/ got really complicated i  love it its great i okay i would like both kerr and keyleth to roll strength saving throws to  maintain hold on the carpet  liam how far are they from me  matt theyre about right now 35 40 feet  patrick you get a plus three by the way  marisha i do  matt yes you do from being just near him hes so awesome that when youre near him  paladins man  liam im on the very edge close as i can get right  marisha 14  matt /none/ 14 okay kerr  patrick 23  matt you both maintain your grip on the carpet i will say for the sake of this keyleth make a  concentration check  marisha i have my advantage cause of warcaster yeah  matt yes you do  marisha that ones cocked  matt you just need to beat a ten  marisha okay yeah i beat that ten with a 26  matt okay so you maintain concentration you maintain hold of the carpet the carpet rights  itself the corpses go spinning upward into the abyss above the carpet has /none/ now spent the rest of  its turn getting into position to guard you and pike just in case its necessary so you guys  are in place percy youve tied the rope  taliesin tied them holding onto everybody and i just have been yelling pull  marisha what  taliesin ive got them on the rope pull the rope down  laura thats you  taliesin who else is on that side of the  matt right now its kima and allura as well  taliesin yeah as many people as can start running out that way  /none/ matt you guys all grab the rope thats currently affixed to percy that hopefully youve been  holding this whole time im imagining you wouldve  liam i dont know wheres the rope theres so much going on  taliesin im going to use my spiderwalk ability to actually just maintain everything and just keep  an eye out and try and safetyspot everything  matt okay so you go ahead and start pulling the rope kima and allura help out alluras not doing  much eight unfortunately but kima is  patrick and we were technically below them ill /none/ just bring the carpet towards them and elevator  them up if i can get below  matt okay cool so now we have kerrek and keyleth keyleth are you releasing the vine  because its currently whats holding them against the stone wall  marisha are you grabbing onto the carpet  matt they both have ropes theyre grabbing onto from percy and theyre being pulled below do a  strength check  marisha i let go and can i switch to a gust cantrip to try and push us down  matt gust cantrip is not gonna be /none/ strong enough to push anyone of your weight  cantrips are very simple  liam i rolled a 19 so 21  matt 21 good so between you and kima you both begin to just handoverhand pulling the rope as  its taut up against the edge and upward vex pike you both begin being pulled upwards and  kerr youre lifting with keyleth keeping that you guys get right to the edge you look down as  you see this one cluster of what looks to be maybe 20 or so bodies comes up not as a ball but /none/ what  looks to be almost a giant skeletal hand made up of smaller corpses is tumbling upward and  reaching its outstretched large maybe 15footwide grasp towards this carpet  laura oh my god  patrick i do channel divinity on that shit  matt okay so what is your save dc for your spell dc  laura grogs still on the other side  taliesin and scanlan  laura oh no this is perfect  patrick 14  matt 14 okay hold on just a second real fast so for your channel divinity here its eight plus  /none/ your proficiency bonus plus your charisma modifier  patrick so eight plus thatd be seven plus yeah thats right  matt 15  patrick 14 oh youre right youre right 15  matt 15 yeah all right cool so with that  laura this is a really cool setup matt though its really fucking badass  marisha its a pain in our ass but its really awesome  laura the visual of it is amazing  matt im enjoying this quite a bit  marisha dead bodies falling to the ceiling reaching up yeah no its cool this is  /none/ definitely a brendan frasier movie  laura yeah for sure  matt okay so as this giant skeletal hand reaches upwards to basically scoop up the entirety  of the cluster of everyone gathered right at the edge of this ravine the carpet pushing them  inward its almost gonna sandwich the party into the palm of this you watch as kerrek clutching  the edge of the carpet reaches up from beneath his armor and grabs his own holy symbol clutches  it firm in his grasp and looks upward shouting a whispered word that doesnt reach anybodys ears /none/  but the ones that its intended for and as it does you watch as a piercing bit of light  jettisons in an upward or downward direction from your perspective towards this hand as it  reaches out its outstretched zombie fingers it bursts and as it does the hand is scattered  outward in a small shockwave all the bodies once linked are now sent into separate disparate  spinning corpses that all reach out helplessly as they all go scattering past upward and  disappearing into the ravine above with that final push you all get down /none/ on the opposite side  of the ravine safe and sound  laura oh my god im so sorry im so sorry  taliesin i grab you and give you a big kiss big sexy stilltiedup makeout kiss hey well done  not passing out this time good for you  laura thanks for saving me darling you  matt grog and scanlan are waving from the other side of the ravine  taliesin i untie the broom and the  laura dont untie it all i like being attached to it  marisha and i go over to percy /none/ and i say smitten smitten  taliesin i slowly start shoving keyleth back towards the ravine  matt just scanlans arms crossed and his eyes are very wide and hes kind of looking around  taliesin scanlans with grog  matt i know  travis yeah were just kind of watching the fucking show  matt so what do you think  travis i think we just leave em  matt yeah youre right lets go you watch as scanlan and grog turn around and start walking  back from where you guys came  liam hand around kerreks neck /none/ pulling him in thank you thank you fucking thank you  patrick that that so this is pretty much just a tuesday for you guys right  taliesin its more of a thursday  laughter  laura i give kerr a big hug thank you saved the day  matt a giant impact as behind you another sphere of these corpses slams into the bridge  causing it to snap and go limp against the upper portion of the ravine  taliesin well okay how are we going to get the last theres still a rope  travis i had /none/ a question so i take one of my five empty jugs out of the bag of holding and i go to  the edge while they were up there doing all that shit i look down and i just throw it straight  down as hard as i can does it immediately go whoop  matt yep upwards  taliesin bit of an arc you want to pee dont you  patrick i see what youre doing and i grab just whatever a rock or something i try to throw it  straight across  matt okay go ahead and /none/ make a strength check  patrick because it should fall at first but if its 5050 it should fall and then fall the other  way and itll go right across  travis right so if you did a jump  liam its like angry birds if you get the arc right  taliesin ive got a great idea you grab the end of the rope thats still tied of our endless  rope on the count of three scanlans going to jump on your back on the count of three theyre  going to make a running jump and /none/ were going to run all of us holding like a giant game of  tugofwar and just see if we can pull them across like a kite  travis i will pull you all into the chasm  marisha i thought everyone was over  matt scanlan and grog  marisha son of a bitch  taliesin well if you tie yourself to the rope too no matter what well be able to so youll  at least be tethered  travis cant somebody fly the carpet back over and then cant pike fly it back over and then  /none/ she and scanlan can bamf over and then i can just try and make it across with the carpet  laura well i could go over on the fucking broom again dear lord how about the bodies are they  still flying  matt theyre still going past and its like little singular ones here and there but every now  and then a cluster  laura thing is i can put grog in the necklace and bring him over  marisha grog can you backpack scanlan  travis yeah and then what  marisha and jump really hard  /none/ taliesin chain of returning  matt chain of returning is whats the range on that  laura 40 feet or is it 60 feet  travis it is somewhere  taliesin ive got a crazy idea  travis doesnt have a range  matt i want to say we have it set at a 30foot range its a big weapon  travis sure im down with that 30 feet  matt are you attaching it to your hammer  travis no im not attuned to that ive got the little hammer now oh sorry the hammer yes  matt so /none/ yeah that has a furthest range of 60 feet  travis how far across the chasm is the thing  matt 60 feet  marisha can you attach the chain of returning to the hammer  travis i mean i can essentially attach it to anything i think  laura i feel like i could go back over  taliesin laughs sorry  laura i know i rolled a one though you guys it was real shit  marisha how much time has it been  matt has passed id say youve probably hit a good minute little over a /none/ minute since the very  beginning of this endeavor probably a little longer given time to look over it since it  happened and converse about what to do  patrick i say if we have a rope tied to her we could bring her back if something bad happened  laura totally totally all right cool attach a rope to me i bamf trinket out so my necklace is  empty and then i take off across the channel  taliesin but we have two are we just going to do it twice  laura scanlan can get on /none/ the broom  taliesin oh and grog can get in the necklace thats very clever  laura so i want to fly back over  matt all right so  laura heart pounding this was terrifying im sorry buddy  matt you jump onto the broom steel yourself  taliesin im gonna anchor this rope also to trinket just so theres extra weight  matt trinket happily allows that anchoring to happen  taliesin all right you guys feed it im gonna be ready  matt you barrelroll across across the way  laura i wanna try to time it /none/ so i avoid as many as i can  matt there are theres a small cluster that comes by and a couple of minor individual bodies  on this side make two dexterity saving throws  laura okay cool cool cool tight tight tight here we go here we go here we go  natural 20  marisha whats up  laura and that ones totally fine too thats a 29  matt you just whip past out of the grasp you hear the clacking of bones  taliesin i think with a natural 20 you could steal jewelry from /none/ one of them as you went by  like thats a nice necklace  marisha top gun highfive  matt you make it across to the other side there you see scanlan waiting arms crossed foot  tapping at an accelerated rate grog waiting finding another vase to throw and all of a sudden  you watch as vex comes streaming across and eventually rights herself back up to your  position her hair falling normally flat to her side  laura oh hey guys  marisha and i give her a big highfive  matt you dont cause youre /none/ on the other side  marisha what  liam she made it one way shes gotta go back the other way  matt keyleth highfives her from across the ravine  marisha highfive woo  liam wait a minute are you saying this story only exists in our imagination  laughter  laura hey grog do you trust me  travis no  laura do you wanna get in this necklace  travis sure  taliesin he knows modify memory  laughter  taliesin back in the matrix  laura and then scanlan  matt so grog a familiar sensation /none/ once youre back in that chamber  i described to you once before  laura and scanlan i want him to affix himself to this broom like really tie him on here  matt you go to get to the broom and he just latches onto the side of your leg  im fine here  laura i still tie some rope around ive got the rope of entanglement i can at least wrap us up  matt you actually magically restrain him with the rope of entanglement so hes bound in a spiral  fashion to the actual broom /none/ as you get on top of it begin to cross to the other side okay at  this point you watch as another corpse tumbles past and looking downward not a hand but what  looks like a giant face emerging built of various pieces of zombified corpses and bones the mouth  opening almost to try and swallow you as you zoom over that way make two dexterity saving throws  the first is against the singular zombie lower dc  liam is she within 30 feet of me at this point  matt she will be in just /none/ a moment first one shes not second one she will be  marisha its her and pike  matt no its her and scanlan  laura the first one is i add my dexterity  matt correct or whatever your dexterity saving throw is  laura okay thats a 26  matt first one you zip past without an issue and thats when you look down and notice the giant  face coming up second  liam wait shes within 30 feet of me now im blessing her  matt okay  taliesin scanlan is also inspiring her  laura /none/ okay thats good thats good though this is good 27  matt 27 the mouth comes up to try and slam shut around you and as it comes up you just arc out  of the way you guys watch as the jaw begins to close and just as these jutting pieces of broken  bone skulls and shoulderblades that make this weird makeshift mouth of this entity begin to  close and slam shut you watch as the broom just barely catches out of the top of it arcs  downward and makes it across the way without impact /none/ just as vax finishes his blessing spell on  her youve all now made it across safely to the other side of the ravine here  marisha now i give her a highfive  laura i untie scanlan and pop grog out  matt grog youre released trinket comes up to you and starts licking the side of your face  travis that really seemed very easy i dont see what the big deal was  laughter  taliesin you want to try again i know that youre considering it reasonably  marisha dont put these ideas in his head /dung/  matt so what are you guys doing  laura move forward i guess  matt all right so you push forward  laura check for traps  matt check for traps okay  liam thank you thank for catching my sister thank you  matt investigation check  liam checking for traps  laura good i hope you rolled well  liam i always roll well on this 18  laura cause i rolled a one again  matt wow better now than a moment ago all right so as you guys push forward into this dark  chamber /none/ now the humans i imagine you still have your warhammer out for light kerrek  patrick yes  matt so you have enough of a radius where you can kind of make out the scenery and such as you  progress forward about 45 50 feet further down this path you see what looks to be a small  structure built into the ground almost like a multitiered statue of some kind and you hear  what sounds like a very faint bit of trickling rushing water  liam statue of a what please  matt youre not quite sure /none/ yet as you approach you look at it and it appears to be a fountain  like a small structure that contains what would be a bowl for water and then a central smaller tier  that opens up into a smaller bowl and kind of a jagged edge to it it looks a little sinister and  at the very top looks to be a humanoid face thats stretched into this ghastly horrified expression  of terror and gasp from its mouth is pouring a small trickle of water but it is upward and its  just spilling onto /none/ the ceiling where its just pooling and separating into cracks the path  continues past it its just in the center of the hallway  travis its going up but were not  matt correct  marisha were just not light enough  taliesin or not close enough  patrick or were not in the area of effect yet  marisha i reach down and i grab a little pebble and toss it towards the fountain  matt okay you toss it towards the fountain the pebble clinks and the fountain is empty it is  dry on the inside /none/ right now on each of the lower tiers because the water that is being poured from  this face is trickling upward and hitting the ceiling its this steady constant stream  marisha pebble  matt you throw the pebble into the fountain it just kinda comes to rest  travis whats on the ceiling just flat  matt it looks to be just a stone ceiling and the waters just hitting in one particular spot if  you want to roll a perception check  travis 16  matt okay you glance up and from what little bit you /none/ can see with your darkvision the water  appears to be impacting something that has a different surface than the ceiling stonework its  smoother shinier it reflects a little bit of light  marisha how high roughly is the ceiling  matt its about 15 feet up at this point  marisha only 15  liam is it a dead end  matt no the path continues past it just straight  taliesin oh god  travis well we could pour a bunch of water in the fountain  taliesin i dont know if we should touch the water /none/ thats coming out of the fountain i think  its coming out of a petrified human thats been turned into a mystical source of water is the  vibe im getting  travis oh i just meant pour water out of the alchemy jug  laura like into the fountain  liam id like to move along the edge of the room checking for traps ahead  matt okay so vax continues forward  liam 19  matt okay so you coast ahead keeping an eye out there are no traps but you do sense that  there is some /none/ mechanism involved with this fountain  liam im gonna stop where i am then  matt okay  taliesin im going to walk up the wall towards very gingerly doing my best to check for traps or  anything unusual towards whatever it is that the waters hitting on the ceiling  matt okay make an investigation check  taliesin thats a natural 20  matt as you walk up the edge whats your actual perception bonus  taliesin my perception with my perception 28  matt okay you make it up to the top and as you glance in /none/ you can see theres some sort of a  green emeraldlike gem that is embedded into the ceiling that the water is just trickling onto  taliesin do i recognize the green emerald gem its a green gem or is it residuum  matt no no it is not residuum it is not processed whitestone it is an emeraldlike gem  although it is imperfect it is not you know a jeweler has not cut over it to make it a beautiful  gem it is a little rough  taliesin and the water is hitting that gem  matt /none/ its hitting the gem and its kind of just pooling around it and sifting into cracks and  being drawn  taliesin im feeling the urge to fuck with this im really hoping someone tells me not to  laura probably maybe leave it  liam wait half a minute half a minute  taliesin im going to edge towards it gently and im actually this is going to sound weird im  going to spit at it to see at what range my spit decides to move towards it  matt okay so you spit at it and your /none/ spit still kinda arcs downward normal gravity then it hits  the water and just gets caught up in the water  taliesin okay so its the water itself thats being something maybe in the fountain  marisha can i do an investigation can i do a closer look at the fountain  matt yeah make an investigation check  marisha man i hate investigating  liam whats the light like  matt there is no light in this room other than the source of kerrs hammer  marisha 20 total on the fountain 20  matt 20 on the /none/ fountain okay there is best you can tell some magical source this is connected  to something youre not entirely sure what  marisha no gems i dont see any gems  matt i mean you see theres no gems based inside the actual fountain itself  the only gem thats  marisha something magical about the fountain  matt yes there is a magical essence to it  patrick i will do it if nobody else wants to can you catch some of the water  in a jar or container  matt yeah if you want to  /none/ patrick cause i look around i dont want to disrupt anything but ill just catch a little in  a bottle once its in the bottle does it still pull upward  matt once you pull it in the bottle it rests back into regular gravity  patrick does it just smell like regular water  matt it smells it smells very stagnant hard waterish like pirates of the caribbean or its a  small world  laura gross  matt yeah yeah its not the clearest of arrowhead its cold  marisha i mean we could have scanlan do /none/ a dispel magic on it  laura yeah  marisha dispel the fountain or the gem or i could carve the gem out of the ceiling  taliesin im standing next to the gem i can pry it out of the ceiling if we have to  marisha but that means you have to touch it  liam what can i see down the way im looking  matt you looking ahead the tunnel continues and youre starting to see more and more of the  essence of reclaimed stonework you can see whereas previously this ravine was an actual /none/  seminatural tunnel that pushed forward the walls begin to get more bricklike its looking more  and more like a really really old for lack of a better term temple or structure where you can see  there was care put into its design  liam okay so the statues in this seminatural chamber and turns into more carvedout  civilized  taliesin i might run down to grog do you have a spare jar or jug that i can borrow  travis i do what do you want for it  taliesin i just want to borrow it /none/ for like five minutes and ill give it back  travis what you got for trade  laughter  taliesin i have nothing  travis is that an ascot youre wearing  taliesin yes it is  travis ill take that  taliesin it wont even fit around your neck  travis i dont care i want it  taliesin do you know how to tie an ascot  travis i want to be dignified  marisha i can teach you later grog  taliesin oh that alone thats adorable i tie a little dickies first day of school christmas /none/ bow  and i take my little pin and i pin it on him  travis heres your jug  taliesin thank you  laughter  taliesin and i go walking back up i have a theory that maybe if we cover the green gem that  might do a thing so if we start to cross and everything goes weird im going to cover the  green gem  liam hey for science  taliesin for science but lets try and leave this room without doing anything maybe  liam besides what youre doing  taliesin im not gonna /none/ do anything unless something happens  travis how high is the ceiling  matt 15 feet  travis okay  marisha hey grog if it comes to that dont worry about it  matt so whats the plan  liam scootch forward to the other side looking for traps looking for traps  matt okay you continue to scootch forward  marisha i stay with grog and percy  laura i stand in between  matt okay so you guys stay back there okay kima and allura stay back waiting for you guys to  scout as well okay you /none/ guys make stealth checks again  laura im scared of all my dice right now just all of them  liam 30  laura 17  matt okay you guys begin to very very slowly make your way up ahead and you watch as the path  ahead of you begins to the ceiling begins to grow higher and higher and the hall begins to  widen open a little bit and begins to split in two directions like all of a sudden the tunnel  breaks into two different paths with the ceiling rising and growing wider on each /town/ of those paths as  it presses forward youre starting to see portions of it are still the caverntype feel but  once again youre seeing more and more sections where it looks like all these walls at one point  were carved stone and had a specific purpose and then over time once again portions of it have  fallen to disuse and ruin  taliesin so nothing the fountain did nothing  matt currently not yet no  liam fuck a duck weve got a fork in the road what do you want to do  taliesin lets /none/ bring everyone towards you now is it time  liam well theres nothing immediately dangerousappearing  laura im gonna try to focus on dragons again and see if i can figure out which direction they are  matt okay so you use another spell slot  travis we dont wanna pour anything into the fountain  taliesin i dont  travis we did nothing to this thing thats right here magically pouring water out  taliesin it might just be the equivalent of a big red button  travis i love buttons  taliesin the world loves buttons  laura /town/ its up to you grog  taliesin you have a jar of unending water if you wanted to  matt vex the sources are still ahead of you theyre still present and still in the direction  you guys are facing  laura do i know which fork theyre down  matt in that direction  liam id also like to use my last instance of divine sense here at this fork in the road  matt 60foot radius up there no there is no sense of anything undead fiendish celestial  marisha nothing no sway  matt not where /town/ they currently are no what are you guys doing  taliesin im waiting for everyone else to im circling to the other side of the green  liam are we all gathering up at this fork in the road  taliesin yeah if everyones gonna cross the room  matt okay so you just move on okay you guys continue and gather at the edge of this fork you  can see a very very faint bit of light coming from both sides of the fork just glancing off a  distant opposite cave wall  marisha both have light /none/  matt both have a very very faint bit of a light source two of you guys make since you were up  front first make perception checks if you could  liam bupkis for me  laura 24  matt 24 glancing both ways for you it splits off and they both seem to curve around in almost  like a rejoining direction or at least they get close to it the split is less of a split and more  that there is just a large column of earth that splits what would be a wide path the /dung/ two paths  eventually seem to join again on the other side  laura and theres a little bit of light coming from the end of it  matt a little bit of light source apparently on the other side of whatever this pillar would be  or at the other side of each of these different paths that its just barely reflecting off of the  cave walls enough for it to give you the essence that there is light further  liam should we all trot along or should we send us down  laura trap you wanna /none/ look for traps the dragons are still in there just ahead  liam this could be it although we thought it could be it twice at least  marisha do we wanna split the party half one way half the other  laura no lets all stay on one side  taliesin if the water were running which direction would the water be running down like  if the fountain filled this is just im trying to conjecture i feel like the fountains gonna  irritate me for the rest of the god damn night  marisha we can dispel /none/ magic the fountain  laura it could just be like this could be a water canal that were looking at right now  marisha i could also get rid of that gem we have options for dealing with that fountain  taliesin do it  liam well i mean if its itching  patrick i will say a lot of the things that weve touched here have been put there to hurt us  if we touch them  taliesin touche  patrick but also the skull that we left behind ambushed us so it seems to be a horse /none/ apiece in  terms of a pattern here  taliesin i figure i think if youve made it this far that youve not touched several things  at this point so this is so obviously a i know  marisha i mean if its just a trap then its just a trap and we avoided it and we moved on  liam all right look weve got two identical passages do you want to flip a coin or can you  see any benefit to either side  laura it looks like they come back together this is just a /none/ giant separation thing  liam flip a coin  laura oh but i have an actual coin  liam do you pull it out come on treasurer  matt what are you guys doing  liam were picking a passageway  matt what are these guys doing are you catching up with them  taliesin yeah ill start walking towards them  marisha i hang back with grog  matt okay  marisha grog what do you think man  travis i just feel like i dont know nothing more sad than an empty fountain  marisha what do you /none/ want to do you want to fill it with water  travis well yeah i feel like thats what a fountain does i mean like if you came across an  empty fountain kind of a worthless thing  marisha do you think a full fountain would help our case in this instance  travis i dunno  marisha we can try it do you want to fill it with water  travis yeah kinda  marisha all right i support this endeavor if you want to do it grog  taliesin i hear this over the ears and im /none/ gonna slowly crawl not too close back  matt allura and kima are um are you certain you want to do this  liam do what now do what now  travis allura its just an empty fountain right its gotta have a purpose  matt right do you know whether the purpose is a good or a bad one  travis i never really get that far  matt i know youve survived thus far on that mindset thats surprising  but do what you will just  taliesin oh shit i have a theory now never mind i /none/ dont want to fuck with it anymore  travis allura youre all smart with magic and stuff why is this horribly terrified face giving  water upwards on an emerald in the ceiling  marisha she rolled good  matt she takes a moment kind of steps forward and looks at it let me see one of your jugs  travis yeah okay what do you want for it  taliesin i hand her my jug  laughter  matt she takes it sets the jug right in the stream and releases it and the jug sucks up and  /none/ essentially covers the gem and the water just kinda spills across the sides  marisha and then what  matt huh my theory was wrong  marisha what hang on what was your theory maybe we can do process of elimination  matt well i was trying to and you hear in the distance behind where you guys came from  impact sounds  taliesin im moving right now  matt what sounds like many many many things falling cracking impacting  marisha hey allura good theory lets run lets run  travis we are running towards vax and vex /none/  patrick it just reversed the gravity in the ravine  matt which as kerrek says this and you all look back you watch as hundreds and hundreds and  hundreds and hundreds of bodies are now tumbling back down into the ravine below  from where they came  liam turn down for what  laughter  travis that was so white that was amazing  taliesin we can make it whiter  travis so white  matt dont make this any whiter please  liam guilty  laughter  travis piano riff  taliesin i may play dungeons /none/ and dragons on the internet but now im embarrassed  matt the waters still going up and its still careening and falling through the cracks its not  a very strong stream its just this like a small faucet turned on its all just trickling  upwards appearing but that gem being currently blocked seems to have had  an effect on the room behind  taliesin good to know  travis to the right or the left  laura to the right  liam going to the right but hold on  matt same marching order as before  /none/ liam im gonna go a little bit ahead 20 feet ahead looking for traps i doubt but i want to  check for traps stealth and traps stealth and traps  matt youre still on the same stealth roll you had before  liam okay great so traps investigation is 18  matt okay the floor doesnt appear to be trapped as you coast forward around the other side  laura check the ceiling i look at the ceiling  matt it looks like a ceiling its about 25 30 feet in height throughout this chamber  liam and as /none/ we move through this passage what do we see as we get closer to it  matt as you curve around you notice that the rocky walls become just stone you see these grey  brick walls that begin to turn as you turn around you see a faint light source from a series of  candleabras that mark the edges of this squarelike chamber there are two distant cages  in the far corners that seem to bear some sort of slumped unmoving bodies inside them there are  two pillars in the center of the room that appear /none/ to be just strewn with carvings and glyphs from  top to bottom surrounding them entirely two large scaled crimson eggs lie placed against one  side of the wall seemingly untouched and on the righthand side of the chamber at the base of one  of these cages you see a withered and longdead corpse of thordak the cinderking folded and  sagging you see a tome propped up against a bookstand on the far end marked by a singular  page where a series of bookshelves and chains line the walls of this apparent laboratory you  see /dung/ at the current opened tome across the way arms crossed and reading quietly a tall female  with dark green hair and silver shimmerylike skin facing away from you  and well pick up for that next week  marisha i knew it  matt cause it is late patrick are you gonna join us for skype next week  marisha or in la  patrick actually i am coming out to la its an issue of how quickly ill be able to get to pax  afterwards  matt oh shit  patrick cause im doing pax south after /none/ my la trip really hoping
